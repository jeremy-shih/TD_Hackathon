At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and now I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you everyone for joining us today on our third quarter 2015 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bob Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing; John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; also dialing in is Ed Coppola, President.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean. Art will not be joining us today. He is out with a flu. After running 86 straight earnings calls since our IPO, this is actually his first miss. Consistent with past practice, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out for me or John Perry or Jean Wood.","It was another very strong quarter for us. We continue to see the benefit in our operating results of the major portfolio transformation we\u2019ve been through the past three years, including the sale of 15 lower productivity malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive faster-growing assets.","Leasing spreads were good again this quarter and we saw good deal volume. Bob Perlmutter will be speaking in more detail on leasing environment in a moment. We signed about 265,000 square feet of leases on space under 10,000 square feet with average re-leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months of 16.3% that\u2019s on a cash basis.","Mall occupancy was at 95.4%, down slightly from a year ago, but if you look at the permanent occupancy, permanent occupancy was actually up 30 basis points to 90.2%. Average malls base rents increased to 53.83%, up from 49.27% a year ago. In terms of FFO, FFO for the quarter came in at $1.1 that compared to $0.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.","Same center NOIs for the quarter was up 7%, compared to the third quarter of last year and year-to-date same centre NOI is up 6.5%. The increase has been driven by increased permanent occupancy, double-digit releasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. Likewise our gross operating margins also improved significantly, gross margin came in at 69.5% that\u2019s up from 66.4% in the third quarter of last year.","Year-to-date the gross margin has improved by 250 basis points to 68.6% compared to 66.1% through the first nine months of 2014. Bad debt expense for the quarter was about $800,000 that\u2019s compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Lease termination revenue was up modestly at $3.4 million in the quarter, up from $2.2 million in the third quarter of last year. And I should note, in the fourth quarter 2015 we forecasted about $1.2 million of lease term revenue, which will comp negatively compared to the $6.8 million that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014.","So that would have an adverse impact obviously on fourth quarter same centre NOI growth rate. We still expect to see fourth quarter NOI growth rate of 4.5% to 5%, however even factoring in the expected drop in lease term revenue.","Looking at the balance sheet, it continues to be in great shape, debt to market cap at quarter end is 36.5%, interest coverage 3.9 times, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis 7.2 times, average debt maturity 5.5 years although with the refinancings we have under way that will stretch to 6.5 year average maturity. The financing market continues to be strong, concurrent with the joint ventures that I\u2019ll be discussing in a moment. We\u2019re doing $1.8 billion in new financing and that will yield over $1.1 million of excess proceeds to MAC that includes the financing of Washington Square of $550 million. The existing debt is $225 million, so we are doubling the size of that debt. We have not only locked in rate at 3.65 for seven years we expect to close on that loan on Thursday, this Thursday, tomorrow.","In South Plains, we closed last Friday on a $200 million dollar loan at 4.22% and that\u2019s for 10 years. South Plains have been previously unencumbered. Los Cerritos Center on Friday, we expect to close $525 million worth of new loan that\u2019s at 4% fixed or 12 years that pays of the existing debt of $186 million. And then in January, we expect to close the loan on Arrowhead, which is $400 million, that rate is also locked at 4.05% for 12 years. And both Los Cerritos and Washington Square are interest only loans for the first six years.","As announced on September 30, we reached agreement to contribute minority interest in eight properties valued at a total value of $5.4 billion, which represent a good cross-section of assets from the Macerich portfolio. They went into separate joint ventures with GIC who was 40% and five assets in Heitman that were 49% in three assets. Expected cash proceeds from the transactions, total about $2.3 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of excess refinance proceeds most of which I just spoke of.","Use of proceeds is expected to include share repurchases under the Company\u2019s recently authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program, we\u2019re also planning to pay down line of credit, and we expect to make two special dividends total in the range of $3.5 to $4.5.","We\u2019re very pleased to enter into these transactions with these very well regarded investment partners this is an expansion of a long-standing relationship with Heitman and the beginning of a new one with the GIC. These transactions provide us with significant capital to create additional shareholder value they also highlight the significant differential between the private and public market valuation of our assets.","The joint venture that will include Lakewood Los Cerritos, South Plains and Washington Square to the total value of $3.1 billion is expected to close within a week possibly as early as this Friday, October 30. Arrowhead, FlatIron, Deptford, and Twenty Ninth Street are expected to close in early January.","Cash to MAC on the first closing is $1.44 billion, which includes about $850 million of excess loan proceeds. On October 23, our Board of Directors declared 4.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.68 per share of common stock that dividend is payable December 4, to stockholders of record to close the business on November 12.","In addition we expect that as a result of the joint ventures that we\u2019re in the process of closing two special dividends of approximately $2 each per share will be paid in December and January. Action on those will take place shortly after the two closings or at least the first closing, which we expect within a week.","In our press release this morning we referred our previously provided FFO per share guidance range $3.86 to $3.94 that also factors in about $0.03 of dilution that we expect to incur as a result of the joint ventures for the balance of this year that\u2019s on the four assets are closing in the next week for roughly two months that remain in this year.","Tenant sales Bob, will get into more detail, but just on overall basis the portfolio tenant sales came at $6.30 for the trailing 12 months. And if you look at that, compared to last year the portfolio was $5.71 on a same-center basis were about 7.7% and $6.30, compared to $5.85 on a same center basis at September 30, 2014 a very strong increase.","At this point I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Performance during the third quarter remain strong as the company\u2019s portfolio continues to benefit from the aggressive capital recycling program achieved during the past three years. The sale of non-core slower growing assets and the repatriation of these dollars into high-growth acquisitions, development, and redevelopment initiatives is resulting in strong performance consistent with the strategy we are seeing an accelerated differentiation by retailers between A quality centers and lower productivity assets.","During the third quarter leasing spreads were 16.3% on a trailing 12 month period lease space dropped slightly by 10 basis points to 95.4%. On a year-over-year basis the portfolio is down 20 basis points, which is \u2013 which decline is modest given the magnitude of the tenant bankruptcies earlier in 2015. And we believe it illustrates the high quality portfolio that Macerich owns. We have discussed many times our goals in reducing temporary tenant occupancy.","On a year-over-year basis our temporary tenant occupancy has decreased 50 basis points, while permanent occupancy rose 30 basis points. During the third quarter leasing levels increased to the top 20 centers within our portfolio we are experiencing the strong leasing spreads at the East and West Coast centers. Demand from retailers is larger than 10,000 square feet continues to be active with over 200,000 square feet lease during the third quarter.","Some notable deals include H&M at Broadway Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Fashion Outlets of Chicago and Uniqlo at Tysons Center. Finally during the quarter we converted 52,000 square feet from temporary to permanent tenants resulting in 109% rent increase sales ended the third $630 per square foot, which is another high watermark for the company.","Year-over-year sales per square foot showed a 7.7% increase on the same centre basis. Positive drivers for sales per square foot include one, increased from high-impact tenants such as Apple and Tesla; two strong categories such as home furnishings, jewelry, athletic footwear and cosmetics; three, store closures and remerchandising of under productive tenants such as RadioShack, Coldwater Creek, Love Culture gap and Wet Seal; and four, strong comparable sales at a number of centers including Fashion Outlets at Chicago.","On the negative side, apparel sales are only showing modest sales per square foot gains, if they struggle with a lack of a distinct fashion trend increasing competition from large format retailers and sluggish consumer settlement. All regions are showing increase in sales with the West Coast Post in the highest growth levels.","Turning to the development projects, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of Broadway Plaza where we are nearly complete with the leasing for the first phase of the identification of this unique asset. A portion in the first phase will open in November with the majority of the expansion opening in May 2016. Earlier in the week, we issued a press release, which is available on our website announcing 45 stores that have signed leases in this development.","We are particularly pleased that Arhaus, Gap, H&M, and Zara are all signed to build two level of flagship stores at Broadway Plaza. Overall, the first phase is 84% of this space under signed leases and we expect to add more retailers to this list prior to the May 2016 opening. We are also pleased with the leasing progress at green acres comments, a 335,000 square foot power centre located adjacent to Green Acres Mall.","The centre has executed leases on 75% of the space and will be anchored by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Ashley Furniture in Burlington, as well as a number of freestanding restaurants. We are planning a fourth quarter 2016 opening. Century 21 held a very successful store opening yesterday at Green Acres Mall. We believe the addition of this unique 70,000 square foot department store will significantly add to the market penetration of this centre.","We are also seeing the impact of adding theatres to some of our premier assets, including Santa Monica Place, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Los Cerritos. These theatres which will open in the coming months have increased demands from high-quality restaurants, fast casual food concepts, and specialty stores. Restaurants opening during the fourth quarter include Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica Place in Los Cerritos, as well as Shake Shack at Scottsdale Fashion Square.","Looking forward, we continue to make progress on the redevelopment of the existing Sears store Kings Plaza, as well as the pre-leasing for the outlet centers in Philadelphia and San Francisco. We expect to discuss these developments in the coming months. Art and Tom have both spoken in the past about our renewed emphasis on our common areas. We\u2019re focused on enhancing the revenue generation and elevating the customer experience, with a particular emphasis on fortress assets for both permanent kiosks and business development opportunities.","We are forecasting by the end of the year 2015, the in place annualized permanent kiosk revenue will have increased over 20%, as compared to the previous year. Illustrative of their commitment to quality at Santa Monica Place we have been able to attract such users as Starbucks, Aesop, which is a high-end UK skincare company and Pressed Juice into the common area. All of these will impact revenue and enhance our customer experience.","Looking towards the end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years. Many of these retailers are public companies and based on their current stock prices the markets are pricing in a significant risk of bankruptcy. Contrary to the previous year, we are expecting less store closing as part of the bankruptcies as many of the retailers are prime candidates for restructuring with a smaller store base. Again, we believe the lower quality centers will be disproportionately impacted.","In conclusion, the performance during the first three quarters reflects a continuing demand from retailers for locations in high quality centers that serve dense and affluent trade areas. The company is focused on better quality centers with a significant presence on both Coast, is consistent with many retailers breaking Brick & Mortar expansion plans.","The impact of the capital recycling that has occurred during the past three years is very evident in the year-to-date results and we believe positions Macerich well into the coming years. Tom?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thanks Bob. Now as we go into Q&A, I ask everyone to, in order to give everyone a chance to ask their question, please limit yourself to one question. Thanks. Now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jim Sullivan from the Cowen Group.","James Sullivan","\u2026from the asset sales. What, if anything, have you provided for in terms of use of proceeds?","Robert Perlmutter","I\u2019m sorry, Jim, the first part of your question cut out a little bit.","James Sullivan","Sure. To repeat, your guidance provided for $0.03 dilutive impact in Q4 from the asset sales. What, if any provision have you made for use of proceeds in that revision?","Robert Perlmutter","Well, Jim, the \u2013 one of the biggest use of proceeds will be the approved share buyback program. And that\u2019s not something that we could start until after the window opened, which will be in November sometime. So there has been some of that assumed in the $0.03. There has been some use of the cash to pay down the line of credit during that period of time. But a lot of that cash will not be deployed in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s been factored into the $0.03.","Operator","And moving on we have a question from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Hi, great. Thanks. You\u2019re looking at your sales per square foot by asset, I was wondering how village at Corte Madera went from 955 to 1,435 sales per square foot. I\u2019m wondering if it was related Tesla Motors maybe starting to report sales?","Robert Perlmutter","Craig, this is Bob Perlmutter. You\u2019re correct. I mean, two comments. Corte Madera has a small middle between the two department stores. So obviously, individual tenants can make a much greater impact. But secondly, I believe that last quarter Tesla annualized, and so now they\u2019re included in the comp sales. So they obviously had a significant impact.","Craig Schmidt","Great. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning out there. Tom, on the stock buyback, obviously, when you guys announced it a few weeks ago with the transaction, stock was materially lower and had a very good run. So how much price sensitivity is there in the stock buyback program? And would you \u2013 are you guys 100% committed to it, or depending on where the stock is you may use that capital elsewhere where it may be more accretive?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Alex, it\u2019s always a function of market conditions. And today \u2013 the price we\u2019re at today, we think it\u2019s still a very significant discount to NAV, which would make a buyback attractive. So at the moment, it\u2019s attractive, and we\u2019ll just have to monitor market conditions as we move forward.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","Yes. Hi, guys. Good morning.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hi, Rich.","Rich Moore","What changes, Tom, occur through the same-store NOI numbers and the comp sales numbers when you guys complete the transaction \u2013 the joint venture transactions? I mean, is that prorated in some sense? Do you make changes based on your percentage ownership in each of those centers?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Obviously, it\u2019s a function of our pro rata ownership. I would say that the growth rate in those centers approximates the growth rate over the next five years we expect from the rest of the portfolio. So it really shouldn\u2019t change things too much. But we\u2019ll just keep picking up our pro rata share of NOI from those eight assets once the JVs have closed.","Rich Moore","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Hi. Just a quick one. What drove the higher cap interest expectation in guidance?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Yes, Mike, we\u2019ve been running about $5 million a quarter, that was just a change to our initial guidance assumption. We\u2019ve been running it a little bit higher than that assumption, which was roughly at $4 million a quarter we\u2019ve been running closer to $5 million. There really was no change in the projects per se. There is always some timing that is factored in when you are estimating capitalized interest and that assumption was just low. If you see like the last three quarters we\u2019ve been running pretty much right at 5 million to 5.5 million a quarter.","Michael Mueller","Okay. So, nothing changed in terms of capitalization policies at the pipeline?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No.","Michael Mueller","Okay. And I forget is that a one question limit or can we have a follow-up?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Go ahead Michael.","Michael Mueller","That doesn\u2019t count though. But your Green Acres Commons, is that a long-term hold in the portfolio?","Robert Perlmutter","Mike this is Bob Perlmutter. We really considered part of the mall and if you look at Green Acres Mall, there\u2019s a significant amount of sales generation that comes from anchored tenants outside the mall, so it seems like it makes a ton of sense for us to own the asset in conjunction with the mall because a big part of the draw is not only the shopping center itself, but all the peripheral development.","Michael Mueller","Okay.","Ed Coppola","Bobby, this is Ed, can I make one comment?","Robert Perlmutter","Sure.","Ed Coppola","It\u2019s also the front door of the mall Michael. When we selectively went after that property during the acquisition process of Green Acres, we saw the opportunity there to integrate it into the property and make it part of as Bobby says the outside portion where Wal-Mart is and all the rest. So, it\u2019s an integral part of the property and that will be very productive and we\u2019re getting very, very good rents compared to other big box deals in our portfolio. So, I assume it\u2019s a long hold.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks, good morning out there.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hey Todd.","Todd Thomas","Hi. First, quick follow-up question on the stock buyback, is there a limit as to how much stock can be repurchased within a certain timeframe and then my other question though is regarding the special dividend, the portion of that special that\u2019s earmarked for 2016, I think you said that portion would be paid in January, is there are any thought or is it possible to delay that distribution until later in the year see how your taxable income position stands at year-end and then make a final determination, are there reasons why you can\u2019t defer that payment at all into the year?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","In terms of that, we have a pretty good visibility on what the taxable income is going to be absent any other asset dispositions, so for tax purposes we\u2019re deferring the closing on a few of these JVs until January and we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re going to just go ahead and make that payment in January not deferred until later in the year. So, I\u2019d expect that once these JVs close that there will be a dividend they will each be approximately $2 a share likely one paid in December, one paid in January. And I\u2019m sorry Tom what was the first part of your question?","Todd Thomas","I was just curious if there is a limit as to how much stock can be repurchased within a certain timeframe?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, typically they say within a given trading date, 10% to 20% of your daily volume.","Operator","Moving on, we have a question from Paul Morgan from Canaccord.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning, just following up on your comments about the bankruptcy watch list and some of the apparel retailers I mean you said some of their stocks are pricing at a bankruptcy, but you didn\u2019t necessarily see the post-holiday bankruptcy season this year as being as bad as it was in 2015 and I just wanted to get a little more clarity on the comment that some of these downsides could take place and the chance could be profitable I mean a lot of the downsizing is typically are part of the Chapter 11 filing and I mean we do contemplate change negotiating access outside of bankruptcy to downsize and become more profitable and how are you thinking about that?","Robert Perlmutter","Paul, this is Bob Perlmutter. I think the distinction I was trying to draw is that when a tenant goes bankrupt in the last couple of years we\u2019ve seen most of them result in the entire chain being closed. A number of the candidates that we believe are potentially priced in the way that bankruptcy is the significant risk. We\u2019re not as certain that they\u2019re going to close this number of stores that the previous bankruptcies incurred. So we basically feel the bankruptcy levels maybe the similar as last year, but the amount of store closings maybe less, because the number of these chains will use bankruptcy potentially to reduce their store count.","Outside of bankruptcy it\u2019s more difficult, because the landlords will typically require some buyout or compensation and many of the companies have not \u2013 there\u2019s been very few examples where companies have been successful doing that.","Paul Morgan","Okay, and then that\u2019s where it gets to your point that you think that the impact would be disproportionately felt on lower tier malls, because in part of the bankruptcy process though the stores that they would want to keep open would be in the high-end malls, is what?","Robert Perlmutter","Correct. The higher productivity malls.","Paul Morgan","Yes, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Christy McElroy from Citi has our next question.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hi, Christy.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning. Hey, guys, thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you expect any onetime debt charges in Q4 and Q1 resulting from the refinancings that you are doing on the JVs, and sort of related to that the $3.86 to $3.94 range is your adjusted FFO guidance. Can you provide your 2015 guidance range in accordance with NAREIT?","Robert Perlmutter","As part of the transaction, we would expect to prepay early both Los Cerritos debt and the Arrowhead debt. Collectively that\u2019s about $20 million a prepayment penalty and that would be split pro rata between our partner and ourselves. And that\u2019s something that would happen as part of the closing of the transaction. The things that would factor the NAREIT definition would include the cost we incurred as a result of the unsolicited takeover attempt and we spoke about those earlier in the year I don\u2019t those in front of me. But that would be something that would be factored into yet to your NAREIT definition.","Christy McElroy","What\u2019s the split of the $20 million between Q4 and Q1?","Robert Perlmutter","It\u2019s roughly half and half.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question, going back to the share buybacks, the 10% to 20% of daily volume. Just curious, when you factor in blackout days, what number of days are really available to be buying back shares in any given quarter?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, there\u2019s a variety of ways to do these buybacks Vin, and one way is an accelerated share repurchase program where you effectively do a program through your investment bank and they don\u2019t have the windows that we have. So once that program is started if we go that route they could buy all the way through a quarter but no blackout windows or if it\u2019s for us typically once the quarter ends we\u2019re in a blackout period until three days after earnings call something like that. So about a third of the quarter would be under normal circumstances would be a blackout period for us just depends on what method we used to pursue with the buyback.","Vincent Chao","Right, got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just another question on the leasing spreads \u2013 still very strong, but they have kind of tailed off a little bit over the last couple of quarters. Is there anything to read into that? Or do you expect that could pick up again here over the next couple of quarters, just given the strength of your sales performance and things like that?","Robert Perlmutter","I don\u2019t think we see any trend that is affecting on I think it\u2019s just a function of what basket of leases got signed in the projected quarter and what expired.","Vincent Chao","All right, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Yes, hi following up on an earlier question, back to Bob\u2019s comments about the challenging retail environment, and cognizant that the store closures would impact the class B malls more, do you have a forecast for the store closings you might see in your portfolio in 2016? Presumably it\u2019s less than in 2015, but is there any sense yet?","Robert Perlmutter","We keep a watch list that is based not only on companies, but particular stores. So where we have generally had a pretty good handle I know going into 2015 we had a very good handle on who was going to close and we budgeted accordingly. So we\u2019re in the same process now when we prepare our budget in terms of looking at not only chains that we think have additional risk, but particular stores that are vulnerable based on the occupancy costs.","Linda Tsai","But is it more or less than 2015?","Robert Perlmutter","I would it\u2019s pretty consistent honestly.","Linda Tsai","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take a question from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, thanks there. So, Tom, I guess for you. Going back to same-store NOI for the quarter, can you talk a bit more on the drivers for the 7% growth year-over-year, especially in light of the 20 basis point occupancy decline?","And then with your year-to-date same-store NOI coming in around 6.5%, maybe some comments on what you\u2019re seeing and expecting in 4Q that prevents you from raising the upper end of the current range?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Okay, Haendel, I\u2019ll be happy to repeat some of that. Actually, the permanent occupancy went up 30 basis points and that\u2019s far more critical than occupancy with a temporary tenant. So the economic occupancy actually went up. If you take a look at the impact of the expense cuts 7% for the quarter, the expense savings and cuts combined were about 2.4% of that. So that still puts us at 4.6% growth rate in the quarter, excluding the expenses that help drive the number up to 7%.","As I mentioned earlier in the call, fourth quarter we don\u2019t expect to be that high, because we include lease termination revenues, that\u2019s cash revenue to us, it\u2019s an active part of the mall business where you make the decision to recapture space, take some cash now, and create a vacancy or not. So we included in our definition of same-store NOI. And in the fourth quarter of last year, we had about $6.8 million of lease termination revenue. Our projection for the fourth quarter of this year is about $1 to $2 million.","So that\u2019s about $4.8 million, that\u2019s going to have an adverse effect on that Same-center NOI number in the fourth quarter. So we think the fourth quarter will be more like 4.5% or so, and if you combine that with the first three quarters that have averaged 6.5%, we end up at about 6%, which is the upper end of our guidance range, still very strong, I might add.","Haendel St. Juste","Gotcha. I appreciate the color and sorry if there was repetitive.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No problem.","Operator","Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs have our next question.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, this is Caitlin Burrows. The debt portion of your supplement mentions that you\u2019re negotiating with the loan servicer for the loan associated with Flagstaff Mall, which is a $350 square foot mall. I was just wondering if you could talk through what\u2019s going on here and how you decided to go that route?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, the debt is basically at or above the value of the center, and it\u2019s non-recourse loan and we\u2019re transitioning that loan back to the loan servicer.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Are there any\u2026","Thomas O\u2019Hern","The only point I would add on Flagstaff is the loan only secures the mall. The power center that is actually very well leased, adjacent is not part of the loan security.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Okay. And I was just wondering on the $350 a square foot that that mall is doing, it seems like a relatively okay amount. So is there anything else just special about that center?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","In terms of the sales productivity, it\u2019s certainly in the bottom part of our portfolio. And as Tom mentioned, when we look at the value of the asset and the levels of the debt, we don\u2019t think there is equity involved that is warranted.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. Why not institute a 10b5-1 program for your share buyback where you can buy it during a blackout period?","And the second question, when you talk about the \u2013 your watch list, does that include companies like Gap or Abercrombie, where the stock price isn\u2019t exactly the low single-digits, but obviously they\u2019re still closing a bunch of stores. Is that in your radar screen as a potential more closures?","Robert Perlmutter","I will try to take the second question, let Tom take the first. Companies like Gap and Abercrombie, our emphasis is more on specific stores than the company themselves. So we focus our attention really within the portfolio and in terms of figuring out, which stores we have opportunities to remerchandise and get higher rents and more productivity tenants.","And you see that in some of these numbers, for example, at a center like the Oaks, you see a pretty significant increase in sales. And that increase was primarily, because we took a low productivity Gap store, low productivity Abercrombie store, and combined them and leased the space to Zara. So part of the discussion with those tenants is to work through some of these lower productivity stores as opposed to a more traditional watch list that says the company is a concern.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","The first question or the first part of that one question in terms of the 10b5 plan, it\u2019s a possibility. I mean, we \u2018re considering all alternatives. We\u2019re not going to scratch anything off the list in terms of how we go about a buyback.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today is from Paul Adornato from BMO Capital Markets.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hi, Paul.","Paul Adornato","Hi, thanks. Tom, you mentioned the improvement in gross margin, I was wondering if you could help us think through that metric how it should be trending over the next two years, and if that metric is an important one for management?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, I think it\u2019s important to improve that metric. It\u2019s harder to measure between portfolios, because we\u2019re not making widgets here. And obviously, it\u2019s more expensive to operate a center in an urban area like New York in a suburban market. But I think we stepped forward about nine months ago and said that, we were committing to push from margin improvement of about 400 basis points over the next two years. We picked up 250 basis points already for the \u2013 through the first three quarters of that two-year period, and we\u2019ll continue to push forward.","Bob mentioned some of those drives that we\u2019ve made on common area leasing, that\u2019s going to be a big part of it. We\u2019ve made some expense cuts this year that\u2019ll carryforward, but you can\u2019t do that every year to the same level. But they have contributed significantly this year. But I think we\u2019re going to continue to see the revenue growth that we\u2019re going to continue to see that improvement as we go through the course of the next four or five quarters.","Paul Adornato","Thank you.","Operator","Jim Sullivan from the Cowen Group have our next question.","James Sullivan","Thanks. Yes, I\u2019ve got a question for Bobby on Primark. Primark, of course, has performed very well in Europe in terms of productivity, that\u2019s obviously a different market than the U.S.. and they\u2019ve opened their first store in Boston here last month. I\u2019m just curious, as you think about the addition of Primark to two of your centers, taking some of that Sears space, what do you anticipate will be the impact on traffic and perhaps sales levels from retailers who might be deemed to be competitive with their merchandise mix and price point?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, we believe Primark will make a significant impact, in particular, on the East Coast, which is where they\u2019re starting their store strategy. We \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking them for two, three years, not only because we feel that they will make an impact, but we feel our centers in particular on the East Coast are very well aligned with what their store expansion plans are.","So right now there\u2019s two transactions that are part of the Sears portfolio. But we\u2019re also having a number of other discussions with them. And, again, we believe our centers line up very much with what their store expansion will be. We are very impressed with the amount of traffic they generate. And we\u2019re obviously very impressed with their pricing, but we\u2019re also very impressed with the physical box that they build, and the way that they handle the traffic through their store.","We believe their stores will take volume from multiple people both inside and outside the mall, both some fast fashion specialty format retailers, but also some big box and apparel retailers outside the mall. So we really, Jim, see their impact as more than just taking market share from mall tenants we see it as impacting many different venues. I think, what you\u2019ll see is, you will see the retailers adjust and become potentially been more competitive in terms of their pricing policy, and it will force the retailers to become better at providing the merchandise to the customers at a more affordable price.","James Sullivan","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question today is from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Tom, I\u2019m just curious, as you think about \u2013 you\u2019ve been working on this joint venture for the better part of 4 to 5 months. You announced it a few weeks ago. And the stock dividend is \u2013 or the cash dividend is pretty easy to model in, because you sort of had to return the capital. But I\u2019m curious, on the stock buyback, why you haven\u2019t crystallized a more firmer plan, and why you\u2019re just not just doing a Dutch tender to take back and do it all at once, rather than leaving some of this uncertainty. I guess I\u2019m curious why a decision hasn\u2019t been made, as you knew this was coming?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, Michael, for starters until the window opened early was nothing we could do and there are business reasons not to disclose and chip our hand as to how and when we\u2019re going to do it obviously we\u2019re going to be in the market buying back shares. So in many respects the more detail you give up there the more works against you as you try to accomplish that goal. So we\u2019re going to keep all those possibilities out there and consider all of them and I would expect us to be active as we go through the rest of the year.","Robert Perlmutter","Well, that I think that was the last question. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. And looking forward to see most of you in NAREIT next month. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I like to turn the conference over to Michelle Raff, AVP Corporate Governance. Please go ahead.","Michelle Raff","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter 2018 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to our press release and SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Executive Vice President Leasing.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Michelle. The second quarter reflected generally good operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio\u2019s key operating metrics. As we mentioned several times on our last two earnings calls that the bankruptcies and early terminations in 2017 tempered growth in the first half of 2018 as we\u2019ve worked through leasing that space up. That being said, the first half of 2018 reflected an improved leasing environment with strong retailer sales, far fewer bankruptcies and a more positive tone from the retailer community. FFO per share adjusted to add back the costs related to activism for the quarter was $0.96 and was in line with our guidance. Occupancy was 94.3% at June 30, that was up quarter-over-quarter 30 basis points from last quarter and down only modestly from 94.4% a year ago.","The leasing activity was good during the quarter, and the economic benefit of that leasing will be reflected in the third and fourth quarter. Doug will be getting into leasing in more detail in a few minutes. Same-center net operating income was down for the quarter, minus 1.6%, primarily due to larger lease termination revenues of $9 million in the second quarter of last year compared to only $2.4 million in the second quarter of this year. Same-center NOI growth for the quarter, excluding lease term fees, was up 1.45%. As indicated on the last earnings call, we expect acceleration in same-center growth in the second half of the year.","Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2.6 million, essentially the same as a year ago. REIT G&A expense was $5 million, down significantly from $7.4 million in 2017. This decrease was largely due to our reduction of workforce that incurred in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect to continue to see this positive reduction in expense in the second half of the year. This is a good run rate for the balance of the year, the $5 million that we saw for the second quarter.","Management Company expense was at $21 million, down significantly from $26 million in the second quarter of last year. This was also primarily due to a reduction in workforce that we went through in the first quarter of this year. At June 30, the average interest rate was 30 basis points higher at 3.84% compared to a year ago. The balance sheet continues to be in good shape. At quarter-end, our debt to market cap was 47%; the average debt maturity was 5.6 years; net debt to EBITDA on a forward basis 8.1 times; and the remaining 2018 maturities are very insignificant at $9 million.","During June, we sold a power center in Casa Grande outside of Phoenix. And in July, we sold another power center in Phoenix, The Market at Estrella Falls, both were joint ventures, and our pro rata share of the total proceeds was $45 million, net of debt $35 million. On March 1, we sold a 75% interest in Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles, and an office building in Philadelphia was also sold in March. None of those assets were in our original guidance for 2018.","I mentioned on our first quarter call that we would address dilution from asset sales in the second quarter guidance update. The dilutive impact of the two power centers recently sold as well as Westside Pavilion and the office in Philadelphia amounted to $0.05 per share of total earnings dilution for 2018. Guidance has been modified accordingly.","We\u2019ve also reduced our guidance based on our current estimate of lease termination revenue for the remainder of the year. As a result of a stronger leasing environment and good tenant sales growth, there has been less demand than forecast for \u2013 from retailers to terminate leases early. Accordingly, our guidance for lease termination revenue is being reduced from $22 million to $15 million for 2018.","Our assumption for same-center net operating income for the full year is also being modified to a range of 1.5% or 2%. Excluding the impact of lease termination revenue on same-center growth, that same-center growth range assumption would be 2.25% to 2.75%. Our new guidance for the full year, adjusted to exclude cost-related activism, is $3.82 to $3.92. More details on the guidance assumptions can be found in the 8-K.","Lastly, just a reminder, the lease accounting rules change starting in 2019. Currently, internal leasing costs are capitalized starting in January of 2019. Those costs will have to be expensed. In our case, we estimate that will have impact of $0.12 to $0.15 per share that will now be reflected through the income statement rather than capitalized. No change in cash flow, but it will change FFO and net income.","Now, I will turn it over to Doug Healey, who many of you had the chance to meet at NAREIT in June. Doug is a 25-year veteran of the mall industry and our Executive Vice President of Leasing. He will be discussing the current leasing environment.","Doug Healey","Thanks, Tom. In the second quarter, sales remained strong and leasing was brisk. Portfolio sales ended the second quarter at $692 per square foot, which represented a 7.1% increase on a year-over-year basis. Economic sales per square foot, which are weighted based on NOI, were $805 per square foot, and that\u2019s up from $752 per square foot a year ago. Trailing 12-month spreads came in at 12.3%. Although down from last quarter, they included a large package of 11 deals with one particular tenant averaging over 4,300 square feet. If that package were excluded out, the spreads would have been consistent with the first quarter rate of 14.7% and 15.2% at the end of 2017. These deals were disproportionately in the bottom quartile of our assets.","Average rent for the portfolio was $58.84 per square foot, up 4% from $56.60 per square foot at June 30, 2017. Leasing volumes have been strong. During the second quarter, a total of 756,000 square feet of leases were signed, bringing the total activity during the first two quarters to 1.4 million square feet. The average term for the leases signed in the second quarter was 5.4 years, which was an increase over Q1 average of 5.2 years. We remain active with the digitally native brands, executing several leases in the second quarter, including: Bonobos at Broadway Plaza; Madison Reed, The Village at Corte Madera; two new 100% Pure leases at Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Fashion Square; and three new b8ta leases at North Bridge, Tysons Corner center and Washington Square.","In the experiential category, we signed leases with Escape The Room at Chandler Fashion Square and XLanes at Fresno Fashion Square. And we anxiously await the opening of the Cayton Children\u2019s Museum at Santa Monica Place in November. Tenant bankruptcies have been far fewer through June than we\u2019ve seen in 2016 and 2017. Through the second quarter, we have had eight tenant bankruptcies. Excluding Bon-Ton, these affect 79 stores, containing 118,000 square feet. Of this amount, we are forecasting that only 14 stores totaling 20,000 square feet have closed or will close. This compares with the year-to-date June 2017, when we had 12 tenant bankruptcies affecting 146 stores and 551,000 square feet.","Turning to redevelopment leasing. Construction is now complete on the $100 million redevelopment of Kings Plaza in Brooklyn, New York. As most of you know, this was a redevelopment of a former Sears Box, which was approximately 300,000 square feet on four levels. This project was designed to significantly improve the merchandise mix, the shopper experience and to transform the presence of Kings Plaza from Flatbush Avenue. In July, we opened Brooklyn\u2019s first Primark store, a new Burlington and a new JCPenney. Zara is slated to open on August 23, at which point the Sears building will be repurposed in its entirety. Combined these retailers are expected to add over $100 million in annual sales to the property.","Redevelopment continues on The Fashion District of Philadelphia. It\u2019s a three-level retail hub, spanning over 800,000 square feet, across three city blocks in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. The scope of this project has increased with the addition of numerous entertainment and dining elements. Estimated project costs are now expected to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million or $200 million to $210 million as the company\u2019s pro rata share. We\u2019ve signed leases or in active negotiations with tenants for over 80% of the leasable area. Noteworthy commitments include Century 21, Burlington, a flagship H&M, Polo Ralph Lauren, Forever 21, Columbia Sportswear, AMC Theatres, City Winery and Dallas BBQ. The grand opening is planned for September 2019.","So in conclusion, our leasing metrics, including sales, occupancy and spreads, remain solid. The level of bankruptcies is significantly lower than last year. And we continued to lease space to new, exciting and cutting-edge retailers. And in doing so, our merchandise offerings continue to be among the best in the industry.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Doug and Tom. Again, welcome to the call. As I look at the quarter, there is a lot to like. Our sales continue to grow very well across the board. Occupancy is not only holding up, but improving. Leasing spreads, which now goes back multiple years, continue in the low teens to mid-teens area, which is extremely powerful. As Doug outlined very well, much lower levels of tenant failures than the last three years. We continue to recycle out of non-core assets. We don\u2019t see much more of that activity, but certainly Westside Pavilion, in particular, was something that had to be addressed.","And we feel that we found an optimal solution for that situation. Leasing volume, if you took a look at it for the first six months it is up about 10% in terms of square footage, and the quality of the leasing has been very good. Our ABRs, average base rents, in place are up 4% year-over-year. As Doug mentioned, we had a terrific, terrific opening of Primark at Kings Plaza, JCPenney recently soft opened, Burlington Coat, which is up on the fourth level of the Sears building, now connected to the mall, had a very, very good opening. They\u2019re all reporting terrific results. Primark, in particular, sees this location as their new flagship for the U.S., and early results based upon traffic and observed sales are outstanding.","A couple of days ago, we had a terrific opening of an Apple store at Broadway Plaza that I\u2019ll touch on later. There has been lots of good activity in the leasing side, with particular strength in the beauty category, and there are a number of new beauty concepts that are emerging that we\u2019re very excited about.","In the experiential retail area of our company, there are tons of new ideas that are evolving. We think these are important elements that we are going to be adding to our centers. We\u2019ve announced our first co-working tenant and location at Scottsdale Fashion Square and our partnership with Industrious. We\u2019re very excited about that. We had alluded to co-working about a year ago with you all, and we\u2019ve said that we see that in a number of our centers. And so we\u2019ve announced it at Scottsdale, and there will be other to be announced on that in the future.","So there is a lot to like. Obviously, the one thing none of you like or that I don\u2019t like is when a company has to reduce guidance. When you look at the two reasons that we had to adjust our guidance, I think they were fairly well telegraphed on our last call as the dispositions became realities that we would address the impact of those, if they happen, which they did, on this call, which we\u2019re doing. And the other obvious point that caused the \u2013 a reduction in our range is the fact that the leasing environment and the tenant failure rate has improved. To me, these are both very good things.","As I move away from that and I think about what we\u2019re doing in the development side of the business, I actually want to talk a little bit about Broadway Plaza, again. That continues to evolve and do terrific. Sales are outstanding there. We\u2019re virtually 100% leased. Just a few days ago, Apple opened one of their next-generation stores at Broadway Plaza. And this features a store that integrates outdoor spaces with the indoor spaces, and it\u2019s really intended by them and us to be a place for folks to gather. The outdoor spaces will be gathering and will integrate the store with the rest of the center. And then inside the store, it features a gathering space that Apple, I believe, calls Today at Apple, where they host education and creative sessions all with a view towards creating a community gathering location.","So their store footprint and prototype continues to evolve and continues to be even more of a draw to our properties. As Doug mentioned, the Kings Plaza complete remerchandising of the Sears Box has been extremely well received. Early reviews, as we look at our traffic in that center compared to traffic at Queens Center, for example, and even Green Acres and since Primark is open, traffic at Kings Plaza is actually up about 7% on a comp basis compared to Queens and Green Acres, which both have had very good traffic, but it just shows you that we\u2019re reestablishing this as a very important retail location. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve down there.","New to the development pipeline is Scottsdale Fashion Square. This is a little bit of a different type of development because it\u2019s a series of developments. And when we looked at it, and we took a look at the dollars involved with the series of developments, we felt that it was appropriate to put it into this supplement. It is not one area, it is not one expansion wing, it\u2019s not a one new building. The intent of what we\u2019re doing there is to elevate Scottsdale\u2019s position and to further enhance its position in the luxury marketplace. We have terrific lineup of luxury tenants there already and with more to come.","We also are repurposing the Barneys anchor spot with a co-working location of Industrious and a new tenant to be announced in the very near future. We\u2019re adding 72,000 feet of new exterior GLA, including eight critically acclaimed restaurants, two of which are luxury \u2013 are in luxury flagship locations as well as Equinox. So this is a center that\u2019s performing extremely well. And it\u2019s always great to go ahead and take a center that\u2019s doing great already and to even accelerate its growth and to set it up to even be more dominant for the future.","So look overall, I feel that we had a very good quarter, very good first six months. And my outlook for the rest of the year is very positive. And I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jim Sullivan. Please go ahead sir.","Art Coppola","Hi, Jim.","Jim Sullivan","Thank you. Hi, Art. Quick question just regarding the interplay between the guidance \u2013 the indicated guidance for 2019 regarding the expensing versus capitalizing of leasing costs. With their significant positive variances here in the quarter 2018 above the Management Company operating expense in the G&A line. So I guess, it\u2019s kind of confusing, but my basic question is, what\u2019s the run rate for the balance of this year for both Management Company operating expense and G&A expense? And then for that [indiscernible] negative impact next year, is that going to be spread between both items \u2013 both line items or primarily in the operating expense line?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Jim, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit there, but I think I\u2019ve got the essence of your question. In terms of the positive impact on expenses in both REIT G&A and the Management Company expense, this quarter is a pretty good run rate to use going forward. In terms of leasing, that would be at the property level rather than in the Management Company expense level, as the\u2013as leasing personnel would be allocated to each property. And it\u2019s just a change in the accounting rules. They\u2019re not finalized yet in terms of how that will happen. But as long as there are internal leasing costs and it\u2019s got a salary or even a bonus, it\u2019s got to be expensed rather than capitalized.","And we expect that to be in the range, I mentioned, of $0.12 to $0.15. Coincidentally, they are approximately the same size \u2013 the savings from the reduction in force and expense. But that won\u2019t change the cash flow from each asset. It just moves it from the balance sheet to the income statement.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Donnelly","Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon. Just a question concerning the reduction in lease termination fees. I understand the reason that you guys had given in your release. I\u2019m just curious, are those fees budgeted on a space by space basis? I mean, do you pick situations where you thought tenants might be open to termination and they later were not? Or is the fee just budgeted as a general estimate? Because I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if these are situations that could come around again for you guys or you think that\u2019s sort of passed?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Jeff, that\u2019s a general estimate. We based it on history. Occasionally, as we come into a year, we have some specific knowledge about a tenant who is interested or negotiating. But that tends to be a very small percentage of the total. So as we came into this year, we used the same \u2013 roughly the same lease termination assumptions as we had actual expense in 2016 and 2017 of $22 million. And as we\u2019re now midway through the year, we look out there, we just don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic. There\u2019s fewer tenants that are interested in negotiation for early termination. The environment is better, and we decided to make the revision based on our view of the balance of the year.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe just one follow-up, if I could. Art, I think, mentioned last quarter that your partner had realized a pretty impressive cap rate on Broadway. Do you guys see any other mall assets or portfolios coming to the market that would extend that pricing in the market?","Art Coppola","You should talk to your brother-in-law at Eastdil. They\u2019ll tell you all about that. I don\u2019t know what the exact relation is, but you\u2019re affiliated somehow. I don\u2019t know. Look it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on that. But I do see the trade on Broadway as being a very positive multiple. And that transaction, I believe, is scheduled to close potentially later this month.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead, sir.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just the first question is, the $19 million of activist expense, Taubman spent $5 million and that was against Jon Litt, who actually succeeded in getting on their board. You guys didn\u2019t have a similar \u2013 I mean, there wasn\u2019t anyone trying to counter and run against the slate. So just curious I mean, it\u2019s 4 times the amount they spent. Can you just walk us through what this $19 million was about? It\u2019s rather, obviously, a big number, especially in comparison to what Taubman spent with their activists?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Alex, I\u2019m not going to compare ourselves to our friends at Taubman, although their expenses, I think, will come in over more than one quarter. Ours, I believe, will be isolated to just this quarter. And those costs were almost entirely legal and advisory costs. We have been well advised, and we think it\u2019s best practices for the company to be well advised, and it\u2019s not only good for us, but our stockholders to continue to be well advised. And that advice can be expensive at times.","Alexander Goldfarb","That sounds like a great advice, those people providing the advice. So Tom, you\u2019re saying it was that we won\u2019t see any lingering contractual payments beyond the second quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. I think that includes everything, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then if I can just ask a follow-up. Can you just go through the $0.05 of dilution because I\u2019m coming up with like a $0.01 from the Power Center. Hudson on their call yesterday said they are picking up a positive $0.005 and you guys have similar share count. So I would think the impact to you would be the same. So can you just walk through the $0.05?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. I\u2019m not sure how you could have possibly calculated the power centers, if you didn\u2019t have a cap rate. The power centers are close to 2.5 \u2013 yes, the power centers are close to $0.025 of dilution. They were so \u2013 non-core assets, very tertiary markets. Casa Grande is 25 miles from Phoenix. And those were a blended double-digit cap rate. So obviously, there was dilution there. Westside Pavilion, we\u2019re selling off 75% of the FFO that was generated there. So that\u2019s roughly $0.02 for us. I\u2019d be happy to walk you through the minutiae of that offline though. So feel free to call me after the call. And the Philly office was about $0.005. So none of those individually were headline news, but you combine them all, it\u2019s about $0.05.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you, Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Thomas, I was wondering if you can maybe just give a little bit more color about when the $20 million was spent? Taubman did have $26 million actually over their two different proxy campaigns as well as dealing with two different activists, $19 million even if\u2013 they\u2019re paid hourly, seems like a lot of hours for lawyers and bankers on something that was not even public. Can you give a little bit more color of what is going on?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I will give you what I can, Michael. For starters, they are not paid hourly. That\u2019s not really how it works. And as you know from observing the public filings, we had significant activists in the stock starting in November of 2017. So the work really started the end of last year. Just ultimately the expenses all came through in the second quarter. So in some respects, that work have been going on for six, seven, eight months, the advice to the legal services.","Michael Bilerman","Then I guess, what\u2019s the breakdown between banker fees and lawyer fees? And is there any executive management retention that\u2019s the other thing Taubman had in their numbers was retaining management, they expensed through that line?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. We would \u2013 90% of the cost was legal and advisory, and I\u2019m not going to break it out between the two. In the remaining amounts, nothing was material, and there was nothing for retainage.","Michael Bilerman","And this was never something you wanted to disclose as it was going on because I think there was a lot of questions that came up on these calls about activists and campaigns and things like that, and you guys pretty much said you\u2019re going to have conversations. You didn\u2019t feel like this is a necessary thing to talk about, given the size of the expense?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Michael, I think you\u2019ve probably followed some other companies that have had activists involved. And obviously, there are expenses that are included in that. And we were no exception. It\u2019s just you don\u2019t know the expense until you\u2019ve incurred it. So we disclosed it when we were aware of it.","Michael Bilerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Drew, on for Todd today. Just a question about the platform. There has been a bit of volatility and some changes in the C-suite, obviously. Do you see any areas of the company where you might need senior level executives in the future? Do you kind of foresee anything of that nature? And if you could just comment on that, that would be great.","Art Coppola","No. I think that we have an incredibly deep bench here. We\u2019ve got a lot of terrific folks. Well, Doug, for example, who is new to this call and new to meeting with you all, has been in the industry for 25 years. He\u2019s been the best for the last 15 \u2013 almost 15 years. So we\u2019ve got a terrific bench here. And we don\u2019t see anything significant in that area at all. We\u2019ve got a great, great team and there is an opportunity here for people that have been contributing here to really help take this company to the next level. Tom, if you want to add to that, please feel free.","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. I think, I went through some of the team members on the last call and their experience. And we\u2019ve got a lot of people who have been in the business a long time and are very capable. And for much of our public life, we did not, for example, have a Chief Operating Officer. And we feel no reason to do that now, given the talent of, not just Doug, but Olivia Leigh and Ken Volk, and a number of other people at the SVP and EVP level.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thanks, Todd [ph].","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Mueller, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Two questions. First of all, the line keeps cutting in and out. I didn\u2019t catch what you said, Tom, about the geography of the lease, the new lease expense at $0.12 to $0.15. I was wondering if you can repeat that? And then also it just seems kind of late for a scope change at Philly, just given how close you were to the original opening date. So I\u2019m wondering what drove it all? And then also how well leased was it before you expanded the scope?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. Mike, on the leasing costs, that will be at the property level. Each leasing member of the staff is allocated to a property. So that will be at the property level, shopping center expenses. And then in terms of Philly, Doug may comment and Art a little bit. The scope evolved because that project was originally going to be almost exclusively fashion outlet. And as we spoke to retailers, we thought that there was a very significant demand for full price. There were entertainment users that had a high interest in being there. And it was really leasing-driven, and that evolved and moved the scope to a direction more of a hybrid center that, I think, contained uses in all those areas, entertainment, restaurant, some discount with Burlington and Century 21, full prices, well, at some fashion outlet. So we really let the retailers dictate where we want with the scope and the design of that project.","Art Coppola","I\u2019ll just add a little bit and then we\u2019ll move on. We apologize by the way to all of you for the reception. I just got an e-mail from our IT department that it\u2019s evidently on the vendor side \u2013 the host side of this, so sorry about that. So I\u2019ll speak up, maybe that will help the reception. Tom brings up a very good point of, when you\u2019re opening something that is more of a pure fashion outlet center, it\u2019s fine to open it up in stages. But when you\u2019re opening up something that is reliant on so many interchangeable pieces that are all complementary and synergistic with each other, we just came to the conclusion, especially with some new demand from some anchor tenants that came in, relatively late to the game, that it would be best to have them all open up at once.","And again, to some degree, it was new demand from folks in the last couple of months, take significant blocks of space that they just wouldn\u2019t have been in a position \u2013 couldn\u2019t have been in a position to get open this year. So we sat down and looked at it, and determined that it would be best to go ahead and have a cohesive opening. And we\u2019ve \u2013 and it\u2019s a terrific opening. So it\u2019s really just an evolution of the tenant mix there. And we feel very comfortable. And I know you\u2019ll hear a lot more from our partner on their call tomorrow about where we\u2019re headed. We just came to the conclusion that a great opening for a center like this is really important and this was the best way to deliver that.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Just wanted to look at the guidance for the back half of the year. Is that just a percent of temporarily tenants to permanent tenants? And do you see any risk in delays of opening just because of the construction shortage, labor shortages that are going on throughout many industries right now?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Wes, we don\u2019t see delays in that regard. And we continue to push from temporary tenants to perm with success. So that will continue throughout the year and into 2019 as well. But I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re expecting any build out delays with the deals we\u2019ve signed that haven\u2019t opened yet.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And is it fair to assume that\u2019s the big driver, there\u2019s nothing on the expense side, but from operating, it\u2019s mainly the just current \u2013 the conversion there?","Tom O\u2019Hern","That\u2019s correct.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Linda Tsai, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Hi. The indoor-outdoor next-generation Apple store at Broadway. Is that over 10,000 square feet? And if so, will that be excluded from sales productivity calculations?","Art Coppola","I believe, it is over 10,000 feet.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then it sounds like...","Tom O\u2019Hern","Linda, I\u2019ll get back to you with the exact on that. I was up there a couple of weeks ago, and it\u2019s probably pretty close to 10,000, but it might be under. But I believe, it probably is over, in which case it would be excluded, but I\u2019ll get back to you on that, if that\u2019s not correct.","Linda Tsai","Okay. Is that kind of a format going for Apple stores where it might be over 10,000 square feet, do you have any sense?","Art Coppola","The one thing I do know is that we\u2019re not in power to speak on behalf of Apple. We can tell you what they\u2019ve done, but we can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re about to do.","Linda Tsai","So of the next-generation Apple stores that exist, are they 10,000 square feet?","Art Coppola","I can\u2019t comment on what they are going to do in the future. But look, the most important thing here is what it does for the center. If it\u2019s over 10,000 feet with our protocol, we \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be included in our sales reporting. But what it does for the center, which is really the important thing, is it creates a new community gathering spot; and really creates a new anchor, and that is what I focus on. And it\u2019s not whether or not I\u2019m going to include it in my sales per foot reporting, which by the way, if we were including it in that, it would, obviously, most likely increase the reported sales per foot. But look, the important thing is, what does it do for the real estate, what does it do for traffic, what does it do for the cross leasing, that\u2019s what I focus on. And I\u2019m very excited about this particular store that we just opened. I\u2019m very excited about other potential new stores that we\u2019re talking to them about. And as they open, we\u2019ll talk about them after they open.","Linda Tsai","And then it sounds like Primark also has a decent impact on traffic. Is there opportunity to add them to any of your other centers?","Art Coppola","We have a terrific relationship with them. As I mentioned, are still with them in Kings Plaza. It is likely their flagship location for the U.S. And we\u2019re both very pleased with the relationship with each other. We\u2019re very pleased with what it\u2019s done for traffic, it\u2019s absolutely measurable, as well as leasing. And we definitely are talking to them about other locations, absolutely. We think they\u2019re terrific.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Linda.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","I guess, I was just wondering with the strong sales growth that you guys posted. I was surprised to see the leasing spreads coming a little low. Now you mentioned that, that could have been due to a package deal. So at this point, I was just wondering what \u2013 how you\u2019re balancing the leasing \u2013 pushing pricing in occupancy and the ability that you do have to push prices when leases come up for renewal or you\u2019re signing new leases?","Art Coppola","Well, please take this the right way. But when you have the leading leasing spreads in the industry, it\u2019s a little hard to view that as a bad thing. I\u2019ve always said and it is absolutely true that sales and leasing have a very strong correlation, but it is not an absolute solid line of connectivity. It has more to do with the productivity of the center. And frankly, I believe, that as a forecast for you, even though I would \u2013 I am very happy to be able to report great sales, that, and I\u2019ve said this on other calls, sales per foot are \u2013 look, there are two dimensional measures.","We know that you want to hear them, we give it to you. But when I think about it \u2013 sales, I think about frankly the commerce that\u2019s being generated from the campus. So frankly, I would rather own a center that does $1 billion of business and does $500 a square foot than a center that does $2,000 a square foot, but only does $50 million of sales, let\u2019s say, a specialty center. So you have to think about the economic engine. And again, look, we\u2019re thrilled at the sales that we\u2019re generating.","We think about campus sales, meaning total sales, really, at least, as much as we think about sales per foot. But look, these are great things, industry-leading leasing spreads, very strong sales growth, both on a sales per foot as well as total sales. These are all very positives. And they do become reflected in the demand that we get for our centers, and the demand that we get for our centers is picking up nicely.","Caitlin Burrows","And then just another quick one. In terms of the lease termination fees you\u2019re expecting for the second half of the year, would you say those are still kind of an estimate that could change or is it more since we\u2019re to the end of the year now specific tenants that you\u2019re expecting move out?","Tom O\u2019Hern","It\u2019s about half-and-half at this point, Caitlin. We do have some specific tenants who are negotiating with, that we expect to see the lease termination agreements come to fruition. And some of it is also just an assumption that hasn\u2019t been specifically identified. So it\u2019s about half-and-half at this point, but at this point we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that $15 million revised guidance.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it, thanks.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Going back to the Fashion District development, I know it\u2019s evolved from the initial onset of being something similar to like the Chicago version, where it\u2019s kind of a discounted luxury outlet to what it is today and that you guys announced a scope by $75 million. I think the incremental ROIC on that is about 4%. So I don\u2019t get the whole story by just looking at the numbers on Excel, but \u2013 and there\u2019s definitely real estate element to it to make the center more viable longer term. But could you talk about the factors that weighed on your decision to change the mix of the tenants and to change the scope?","Art Coppola","Well, first of all, we added square footage to the project that was not previously in the project. When we first announced the project, we did not intend to develop the third level above the street. It was the concourse, which is connected to the subway stations street plus one. So we added to the scope in terms of size. And I did see your note, and it\u2019s a legitimate question, but it\u2019s not a binary answer about the incremental cost and the interpolation of the return on incremental dollars. It didn\u2019t work that way. So look, we\u2019re just bringing everybody up to date on the status of the leasing, the status of the opening, the status of the spend and the status of our projected return. We\u2019re very pleased with the demand that we\u2019re getting. It\u2019s all demand-driven. And we are excited about the opening that\u2019s scheduled for next year.","Ki Bin Kim","And is Eataly still a tenant there, potential?","Art Coppola","They never were. No, they were talked about the early days, but that was three years ago.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Right, thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeremy Metz, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. I jumped on a little late. Hopefully, you didn\u2019t go over on this. But just you spent a lot of time talking about digitally native tenants and using space and more as a sort of laboratory. You previously indicated that some of that were to start showing up in 2019. And so as you do this, should we expect to see temp or short term leasing activity tick up form where it\u2019s been running? And then how do you protect yourself from a cost or CapEx perspective in terms of potentially increasing churn as a result?","Art Coppola","You\u2019re breaking up a little bit during the question, but I\u2019ll try and answer it for you. Look, our overall outlook is very positive in terms of what we see with the digitally native brands. We are actually creating laboratory space within our properties, and we\u2019re starting it at Tysons Corner later this year where we\u2019re taking 11,000 square foot location. And we\u2019re going to allow digitally native brands. We had it configured with modular walls and modular spaces in the space, so that we can break up that 11,000 feet into 18 different configurations.","And on that one, that entire space is intended to be temp, not temp from the viewpoint of the type of tenant that you put in there, but the idea is that it\u2019s a testing lab for digital brands to test the traffic and the business they can do on a property. And then, if they do well, which we hope they do, then they will take a permanent location. Now by doing that and by doing it in a modular way, it reduces the cost of opening a store and the investment that the brand and we have to make dramatically, and it makes it far easier for us to allow people to do something that we call a pop-in as opposed to a pop-up, which to me is they can come in for three months to six months to one year.","And if they like it, then they can go ahead and take a permanent location with us. And we will likely be adding these, say 10,000 foot laboratory spaces, which we call brand box, to many of our centers over the next couple of years. So look, we\u2019re very bullish on what\u2019s happening here. I will say that overall, that with the digital brands that they are looking for permanent locations, but we\u2019re going to be willing to let them go ahead and test the market with a temporary type of lease, and we\u2019re actually dedicating locations within the center as laboratories for them to do so. I\u2019m very bullish on what\u2019s happening in this space.","And it\u2019s clear to me that as the brands begin to get confidence in their ability to operate stores, then the same energy that they put into creating their fundamental business when they were born online and they raced against the clock to get as big as they could, as fast as they could, that they\u2019re going to begin to do the same thing when they go offline. And so there\u2019s definitely going to be a hockey stick graph that is going to track the store openings of digital brands. It will be slow in the beginning. They\u2019ll try a pop-up here and a pop-up there, try a store here and store there. But we see absolute tangible evidence that as they get that confidence that then want to talk about how many stores can we get open. And that\u2019s happening with a number of our tenants and we\u2019re very bullish on it.","Jeremy Metz","Appreciate the color.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hey, guys. Thanks for allowing the follow-up. Just wanted to follow-up on Ki Bin\u2019s question on Philly. If it wasn\u2019t a lower yield on the incremental spend than the added square footage, was it because of the \u2013 was it a function of the longer carry without NOI flow because of the delay or are rents on the projects coming in lower than expected? And just related to that, presumably you had previously expected some NOI contribution from Philly in 2018 in the fourth quarter. Did that factor into the guidance decrease also?","Art Coppola","I\u2019ll let Tom go ahead and address that question, and I\u2019ll come back to the return after he finishes.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Philly was \u2013 in our thinking, it was not a real significant amount of NOI that would have been coming in this year. It was a little bit, and we adjusted the range. We factored that in as well.","Art Coppola","And as far as the returns, Christy, let\u2019s not hold us to a standard that\u2019s different than everybody else in the universe. I mean, nobody gets into that level of detail of saying, while this tenant is paying this and that tenant is paying that. It\u2019s \u2013 there must be 55 different elements that went into, as we expanded the size of the project, the scope of the project and the identity of the tenants that we brought into the project.","And so we\u2019re just doing our best to report to you the exact timing, the exact cost and our exact expected returns. And to give you color on the names of the tenants, which I believe that our partner has been provided a significant amount of color on that as recently as today or they will tomorrow on the names and the types of uses. So we feel very good about where we are, but it\u2019s \u2013 there must be 50 factors that go into the question that you asked, and it\u2019s not \u2013 you can\u2019t just look at the incremental spend and the incremental return, and then try and draw a solid line. It can\u2019t be done. It\u2019s not reality.","Christy McElroy","Sure. And I totally get that. I guess, we\u2019re just trying to wrap our arms around whether it\u2019s on the rent side or the cost side, especially just given the environment for construction cost. But my follow-up question is, it\u2019s actually a follow-up from Caitlin\u2019s on the term fees. I appreciate you\u2019re providing the same-store [indiscernible] excluding lease term fees. I\u2019m just trying to look at your revised guidance range of 1.5% to 2%. What would that guidance be excluding the lease term fees? I think, we have kind of the moving parts on the whole, you\u2019re expecting another $9 million to $10 million of lease term fees in the back half of the year, and that\u2019s roughly in line with what you had in the second half of 2017? But I\u2019m just not clear on how much of that was attributable to the same-store pool? Does that makes sense.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, again, it\u2019s an assumption. It\u2019s not necessarily assigned to a specific center or tenant. So you can assume all of it is. I mean, I think, I gave the range. We expect our same-center growth, excluding lease term fees, to be 2.25% to 2.75%, somewhere in that range here.","Christy McElroy","Okay. So all of the $10 million that you booked in the back half of last year, that was all same-store?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, I believe so. And if not, I\u2019ll get back to you, but I believe it is.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you so much.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today, and look forward to talking to you over the remainder of the year.

Welcome to The Macerich Company Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jean Wood","Good morning. Thank you all for joining us today on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainty and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the Company\u2019s Web site at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing; and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thanks, Jean. Just a reminder everyone on Monday November 17th we will be hosting an investor dinner in Santa Monica and that will be followed by an Investor Day on November 18th. We encourage all of you to attend if possible.","Consistent with past practice on these calls, we\u2019re going to be limiting the call to one hour. If we happen to run out of time and you still have questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call me or alternatively Art, John Perry or Jean.","It was another strong quarter. In general we continue to see strong operating results. Leasing spreads were good again for the quarter. We signed 184,000 square feet of leases, 10,000 square feet and below. Average releasing spreads 20%, that's trailing 12 months. While Occupancy was at 95.6%, up 190 basis points compared to the portfolio at September 30 of '13. If you look at the same center occupancy excluding dispositions the occupancy gain was up 130 basis points at 95.6 compared to 94.3 at September 30 of '13.","Average base rents increased to $49.27 up about 4.6% from a year ago. For the quarter, FFO was 0.88% compared to 0.86% for the quarter ended September 30 of '13. That was within our guidance range of $87.5 and $0.90 per share for the quarter. Same center NOI came in at 3.93% compared to the third quarter of last year. That increase was driven by occupancy-positive re-leasing spreads and annual CPI increases. And just a reminder on that same center NOI calculation, our same center calculation does not include straight lining the rents, it does not include SFAS 141 income, it\u2019s a cash basis number. It also does not include redevelopment of projects coming online, the benefit of those are not reflected in our same center numbers. The gross operating margin for the quarter including JVs was up at 66.4% up from 65.9% a year ago.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, dilution from asset sales during the quarter was $0.05 per share most of which related to assets sold in the second half of 2013. Bad debt expense for the quarter was 1.7 million that compared to a 1 million in the third quarter of '13. During the quarter, we bought a 50% interest in the Gallery Mall in Downtown, Philadelphia as a result of that acquisition during the third quarter, we wrote-off approximately 1.4 million of acquisition-related expenses or $0.01 a share. Currently the average interest rate in the portfolio is down to 4.04% that compares to 4.22% in the third quarter of last year. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, our balance sheet metrics included debt-to-market cap at 39%, interest coverage ratio of 3.2 times and debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2 times. Average debt maturity 5.3 years and floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt under 14%.","In our press release this morning, we narrowed our 2014 guidance for FFO per share and increased the midpoint by $0.05. Our FFO per share guidance range is now $3.57 to $3.63. So although we came in for the quarter $0.01 under the Street, we are guiding for full year 2014 FFO per share above Street expectation. Also we added some additional disclosure information in our 8-K, you\u2019ll noted on Page 9 we added a new guidance range page, it talked about our major assumptions and how they compare to the original guidance. Some of those include net dispositions guidance for the year which remained in total in the $240 million to $250 million range, consistent with the initial guidance. But the earnings dilution related to the 2014 asset sales has been reduced by $0.03 as the timing has changed to be later in the year compared to the original guidance.","Same center NOI guidance has been reduced from the mid-point of 4% to a mid-point of 3.63%. This 37 basis point change amounts to about $3 million over the course of the year or a $0.02 per share decrease. This adjustment from our original guidance results from downtime on releasing space from significant bankruptcies of Coldwater Creek and Love Culture, there is a short-term earnings hit, although in most of these locations we\u2019re putting in stronger tenants at better rents and there will be a long-term benefit. For example on the Love Culture space which is about 88,000 square feet the mark-to-market on that space is up 50%.","Our initial guidance does not assume any acquisitions as a result of buying a JV interest in The Gallery and another small interest we bought earlier in the year. We are now including about $0.02 of 2014 earnings accretion from those transactions that number has been reduced by the $1.4 million in acquisition expenses related to The Gallery. Looking at tenant sales, the portfolio mall tenant sales per foot came in at $5.71 that compared to $5.49 a year ago. If you look that on a same center basis excluding the dispositions sales per foot were $5.69 that compared to $5.67 at September 30th of last year. Looking at total center sales for all tenants in the same center excluding anchors our sales increased for the quarter ended September 30th was up 2.1%.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you Tom and welcome to our call. While we never like to give you downward revisions to our estimates it is important to add a little bit more color to the same center NOI focus that has come out of our earnings release. As Tom mentioned, we have broken out for you the same center NOI that we increase that we have for our top-40 assets which comprised about 88% of our EBITDA compared to our bottom 11 assets which are above the balance of 12%.","As you can take a look at our supplemental filing you can see that the top-40 assets had same center NOI increases of 4.1% for the nine months ended September 2014 which compares to 4.6% in 2013, 3.8% in 2012, 4.1 for these assets in 2011 so very strong growth amongst our top-40 assets. And this really validates when you take a look at the same center NOI growth that we have from our bottom 11 assets, our decision to significantly prune our portfolio and to dispose of about $1 billion of assets over the last couple of years and to redeploy that money into our best assets.","Dialing in a little bit deeper into the same center NOI numbers, if you take a look at our top-40 assets with a 4.1% same center NOI increase. We had significant transition going on at three of our very best centers Queen Center is going through a 10 year rollover in leases. Tysons Corner is going through not only a 10 year rollover in the expansion leasing, but also the whole introduction of new tenant sort of coming as part of the densification project that we have there. And we\u2019re going through a very significant remerchandising of Kings Plaza in Brooklyn.","All of three of these centers remain in our same center pool and while these three centers represent a significant component of our EBITDA at about 14% of the top-40 centers in terms of EBITDA. Their same center growth for the year has been relatively flat to-date and that\u2019s really totally due to frictional vacancy and cautious remerchandising decisions. They will be the source of significant growth for us in years to come, but again if you take a look at the same center pool amongst our top-40 and you take these three assets that were relatively flat for the year. The other 37 of the top-40 assets actually were up about 4.7% year-to-date.","So look they\u2019re very--very -- there is a lot of numbers that play into the same center number I will say that it does have a touch of two dimensionality to it and I would much rather increase my EBITDA at our top centers then at our bottom centers but we\u2019re very conscious of the focus that people have on same center NOI and we\u2019re very confident that based upon the pruning that we\u2019ve gone through in our portfolio based upon the leasing results that we\u2019ve been achieving here over an extended period of time and those that we project for the year to come as well as all of the redevelopments that we have underway and expansions that we\u2019re very well poised to get significant growth out of our portfolio.","I want to now turn to dispositions and acquisitions. On our last call we had indicated that we thought that we would have net dispositions of about $250 million for the year, at that point in time we did not have any centers that were under contract to be sold. Today we have a couple of properties that are currently under contract to be sold which we estimate will close before the end of the year. Those will generate proceeds to us of about $300 million. We outlined of the center, South Towne Center in Salt Lake that is currently under contract and is estimated to close over the next 30 days and there is one other property that will be disclosed if and when it closes which we anticipate that it will.","On the acquisition front, we were a little bit of a disadvantage on our last call because while we knew that we were going to be entering into a joint venture on The Gallery all of the final approvals and documents has not been signed, we knew that it was eminent that it was going to be done but we have a policy of not identifying acquisitions until they are done. So we were not really able to talk at all about The Gallery on our last call.","We are extremely pleased to have entered into a joint venture with Penn REIT to own 50% of The Gallery in Philadelphia. This week we had the opening of Century 21 which is a new-to-market retailer to the property. And over the next six months, we anticipate that we will be in a position to lay out for you both the dollar spend that we would anticipate that the venture would make as well as the return expectations but rest assured that we'd see very significant redevelopment opportunities at The Gallery, we believe that the 8% to 10% returns that we'd see on our redevelopment and expansion pipeline that we see throughout our company that these are clearly attainable at The Gallery and we look forward to sharing those projections with you once all of our entitlements are done and what's once the numbers are further refined.","Furthermore on acquisitions, we find ourselves in a little bit of a uncomfortable position today about acquisitions also because having just given new revised guidance for the year, we also have reason to believe that there is an acquisition that will close before the end of the year, it is not currently under contract otherwise we could potentially talk a little bit more about it. So stay tuned on that and hopefully we will be able to report to you that we have added a very nice acquisition through the portfolio between now and the balance of the year. So again really just to recap the big story here is that the pruning that we outlined that we were going to do here in our company two years ago is largely complete. We've recycled about a $1 billion and repatriated about a $1 billion of proceeds with the closings that are projected over the next month or so back into our company and recycled those into the best assets that we own.","Our redevelopment pipeline remains very strong, everything is moving exactly on budget and on pace within our redevelopment pipeline. One of the next critical junctures in our redevelopment pipeline is the grand, the opening of the expansion of Fashion Outlets of Niagara which opens up next week well over 90% leased and showing returns double-digit returns on the incremental spend. So we are very pleased with the fundamentals that we have here and with our prospects for growth going forward.","With that we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then if you\u2019d like to ask another question you may queue up again that way everyone has opportunity to ask a question. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","Art, just a follow-up on the dispositions, last quarter you implied, as you said, that nothing was in the works on the disposition side, but during the quarter obviously you went under contract on South Towne. It sounds like you have another one in the works. What's changed? And can you provide just a little bit of color on demand for B and C malls today -- maybe just some general comments on the market?","Art Coppola","Well nothing has really changed other than when you are on a call and you are asked a question in your deep in the negotiations in terms of a disposition but it's not signed or the buyer is not hard on their deposits or finished their due diligence it is nothing much you can really say. Nothing certainly that adds to your position of leverage as a seller. So it\u2019s best to be somewhat vague in terms of that but we had projected on our last call that we would have net dispositions of $250 which was net of the $100 million acquisition of The Gallery. And at the end of the year I think we will end up at the gross dispositions of $350 and net of the $250 just as we have said, even though about $300 million of that disposition number was not under contract three months ago. If the market remains very good there are buyers that are out there that are constantly emerging. One of the transactions actually the next two transactions that we have under contract are each with buyers that we have not transacted any of our other mall dispositions with. So the pool is expanding and the pool remains strong.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup","And then just regarding the downtime on the Love Culture and Coldwater Creek space, when do you expect those move-ins? I think you mentioned 50% mark-to-market on the Love Culture space. What's the mark-to-market on the Coldwater Creek?","Art Coppola","Bobby, you want to?","Robert Perlmutter","Yes, sure. This is Bob Perlmutter. The mark-to-market on the Coldwater Creek space is not as high as the Love Culture is. We had 10 Love Culture stores for assumed leases so there was no change in that and six, we\u2019re in the process of re-leasing. We think most of the Love Culture and Coldwater Creek spaces get re-leased over the next 12 to 18 months. So it should be re-leased in the \u201915 the majority of the spaces.","Art Coppola","And we are patient on the spaces, several of the Love Culture spaces in particular are in very good locations within some very good centers and we may have a disproportionate exposure to Love Culture just because of how their growth got laid out as a company, but the good news is, is that the real estate that we are getting back and we have taken back is in great centers. And we are going to be patient in great centers and really chase the correct merchandising decision as well as the correct rental structure that will add NAV to the properties even if that means that they will be vacant for a quarter or two extra. We are not chasing quarterly results here we\u2019re chasing value creation.","Robert Perlmutter","And I think that feeling on the real estate was illustrated about that fact that we chose not to restructure the leases which is what they would have preferred in the bankruptcy knowing that we had a lot of confidence in the real estate centers they were at.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What is the next step for the Gallery? Is it the public assistance and then you can proceed forward or is there another step before that?","Art Coppola","It\u2019s entitlements in general but we are very confident that we\u2019re headed in the right direction there with our partner and we\u2019re really bullish on the leasing conversations that we\u2019ve had with retailers to come to the property. We are in a position where we\u2019re still perfecting our entitlements including arrangements between us and governmental authorities. So once those are finished we\u2019ll layout with the same degree of specificity that we do all of our development, the re-development projects for you beyond on the dollar spend and the return expectations as well as the timing. But we feel very good about where we are. And we have had numerous development meetings with our partner as well as numerous meetings with city and state officials and we\u2019re in conversations with many tenants and we feel very good about our investments there.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on Paradise Valley, where does that redevelopment stand?","Art Coppola","We\u2019re continuing to talk to significant new junior anchors and anchors that come in at the center and at this point in time a part of it would be the possibility of recycling some department store space maybe one of the department stores. So we\u2019re being patient there and we\u2019re still optimistic that there is a good answer for that property. It\u2019s a solid citizen today, and we\u2019re very confident that it can be repositioned to service, it\u2019s immediate trade area in a better way than it currently dose.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","A question for you on CPI and the CPI bumps that you guys have in the leases. How much does that and the fact that we have no CPI to speak of hurts same-store?","Tom O'Hern ","Rich, we typically do the calculation effective January 1st and it takes the CPI for the period the year ended end of October the year before. And in the case of this year the CPI was 1.1 for that period of time. We typically have a multiplier in our leases of two or three times CPI but in and then often the retailer will negotiate for sealing of 3%. So it was unusual in 2014 that some of the CPI increases did not match, none of that 3% some of them by calculation did not get that high that\u2019s a little bit unusual. I think if we look back right now where CPI is over the last 12 months it\u2019s running about 1.8% or 1.9% so we won\u2019t have that situation in 2015 when we do the calculation. So 2014 was a little bit unusual in that regard.","Art Coppola","And just to follow-on to that you raised a very good question, because we\u2019re putting up very strong releasing spreads even though there is basically new cash to old cash as opposed to the new straight line to old straight line. If we were reporting our releasing spreads using new straight line to old straight line our releasing spreads would be significantly higher and our same center NOI growth would be at least 50 to 75 basis points higher just by virtue of the method that we have elected to go with in terms of our rental spreads. We always going back several years ago we just did not like recording phantom income and we preferred to have our income to be as close to cash as possible, the retailers like it also. But embedded in our leasing structure, if we are by comparison the only mall company that is predominately using CPI cash type of clauses as opposed to straight line, then we\u2019re penalizing our same center NOI numbers by at least 50 basis points a year. But it\u2019s the right decision for us for our portfolio in our opinion.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Good. Thank you, Art. And then just to follow-up on that real quick, guys, staying on the same-store NOI theme, how much of the fact that those 11 assets at the bottom of the sales-per-square-foot pool underperform on a same-store NOI basis is sort of self-fulfilling in the sense that you don\u2019t put a lot of capital into those, you don\u2019t spend a lot of time on those compared to the ones that have higher sales per square foot?","Art Coppola","I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that one because frankly one of the reasons that we have decided to prune our portfolio is that we find that we treat all of our children with love. And so even centers that don't generate a lot of EBITDA it\u2019s hard to ignore them. And so you do pay attention to them. So I am not going to say it's based upon not paying attention to them, but we are not even putting money at them. The money decision is a different issue. Money should only be spent where it can get the best possible returns and generally speaking we find that we get the best returns by deploying capital in our best centers.","Operator","We will go next to D.J. Busch with Green Street Advisors.","D.J. Busch - Green Street Advisors","Art, I know you spent a lot of time on the last call talking about occupancy cost ratios, but just looking at the property, the sales per square foot by property, looking at the 10 to 20 or the 11 to 20, occupancy at 97%, obviously much higher than that if you exclude what's going on at Kings Plaza. Cost ratios sub-13% or 100 basis points lower than the top 10, do you see just as much rent growth opportunity in that second 10 grouping as you do in your top 10 assets?","Art Coppola","Actually it\u2019s a good question. The answer is yes.","D.J. Busch - Green Street Advisors","Is there any -- can you quantify that at all or is it just -- how much higher can you\u2026","Art Coppola","They are all great centers. They are in -- the fact that they just happen to not be in our top 10, doesn\u2019t mean in some people's companies if they are 11 through 20 here would be 1 through 2 elsewhere, but they are great centers. And there is a story behind each and every one of them. They are all very solid citizens on Kings Plaza, Cerritos, Arrowhead, Kierland, Danbury, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Freehold, Fresno Fashion Fair, Modesto, these are some of our best properties, and there is significant continued room to grow. Not all of them have Neiman Marcus or Nordstrom in them and not all of them have Apple in them either. So that does influence some of the numbers but when you look at our same center EBITDA, NOI growth actually 11 through 20 outperform probably one through 10 as I think about it. Because we are very patient when we are making decisions at all of these properties, but we probably tend to be a little bit more forward thinking in the great properties where you really want to make sure you are getting the right rents and making the right merchandising decisions. But we actually focused on a decile of centers for us that as I was looking at our same center NOI numbers over the past couple of years that 11 through 20 category they've been batting at a very high batting average. Bob, do you want to add anything?","Robert Perlmutter","The only thing I would add Art is many of these are also because the metric of sorting is sales per square foot and many of these are larger contributors as well from an NOI standpoint."," D.J. Busch - Green Street Advisors","And then just one quick follow-up, following up on one of Rich's points, just looking at the bottom 11 assets, occupancy grew quite a bit, but obviously NOI is going in the wrong direction. What are you able to sign from an occupancy cost ratio standpoint with a portfolio of $300 a square foot, or is that normalized occupancy cost ratio at?","Robert Perlmutter","This is Bob Perlmutter. I am not as certain that there is a number that becomes the occupancy cost. A lot depends on whether the tenant is already in the center or not. A lot depends on the capital structure for new leases in terms of limiting or mitigating the capital but the tenant puts in, a lot of it depends if it's part of a market strategy or a single market store. So I think the occupancy cost is one factor but it becomes less important as you move down the tier of centers.","Art Coppola","But it is conversely it is also true that the higher the sales per foot of a property, the higher the rent can be as a percentage of sales. So it really gets to be geometric the opportunities that you get in the great centers.","Operator","We will go next to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","The first question is a two-parter, but it both centers, around the same-store NOI. The first part of the question is, given that lower bucket is definitely dragging on your same-store NOI, what do you think -- what percentage or how much of that bucket do you think will be left by the time we get to the end of next year? And then second part of the NOI question is, a while back you guys had spoken about converting temp to perm, which would think would be additive and would help boost NOI. So just sort of curious how much of a benefit that you are seeing from that and how much we should think of that adding going forward?","Art Coppola","We are going to try not to penalize you for having two and a half questions, Alex. Good question. I will be open with you and say you that on the temp to perm, I think our being patient in making the right decision for the real estate has not caused that conversion to happen and dynamically as maybe everybody would like to see it happen. It\u2019s not quite as simple as marking a space to market. But it\u2019s clearly like the stronger your portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to convert those temps to perms. But we want to make the right perm if you\u2019ve been patient for a period of time you don\u2019t want to like convert from temp to perm just to report that we\u2019ve done that conversion.","Tom O'Hern","This past quarter it was flat Alex and the reason for that is some of the space we got back from Coldwater Creek and Love Culture was filled temporarily.","Art Coppola","We added temp while we are now seeking the new perm.","Tom O'Hern","Exactly, so that\u2019s why that number didn\u2019t decline for the quarter.","Art Coppola","And I am sorry I missed one of your questions Alex, which one did I miss?","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","It was the bottom -- the 41 to 52 bucket, that 9% of your NOI and that same-store NOI is dragging. It seems like you guys are still at a pretty good clip of disposing of assets. How much waiting -- where do you think that bucket is going to be at the end of next year?","Art Coppola","Well, I rather not answer it for the end of the next year, we will clearly when we give guidance for next year as we have for the past of couple of years will be as precise as we can be about where dispositions fit in that picture. And so if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019ll address that as part of the guidance. The percentage of the EBITDA that comes from that both bottom 11 assets is now under 10%. And I see that number continuing to shrink both as a consequence of dispositions periodically, but also is the consequence of adding either to the size through expansion or repositioning through redevelopment or periodically acquiring centers that end up being in your top 10 or 20.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. Just a quick question just the Sears has been in the news quite a bit in terms of fundraising. Just curious if they have been more active with you guys in terms of looking to monetize some of their assets inside your boxes say over the past six months or so.","Art Coppola","Okay. I don\u2019t know that I would say more active, but we will tell you that the conversations that we have with them are relatively more frequent these days than they have been at times. I do think that it feels like that there is some rationalizations that are occurring at Sears that are positive I think that the Primark announcement could be a net positive for the properties that they announced that they were doing some subletting to Primark. In fact, we\u2019re in conversations with Primark both on some situations that we have that we presented to Primark but also in collaboration with Sears. So I\u2019d say that in terms of their appetite to rationalize and monetize that they are getting a little more urgency to their actions there and I think that it can be very positive for our centers.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on the overall back-to-school season, just curious if you would just share some thoughts on what you guys saw -- obviously the sales growth did tick up there, but I don\u2019t know if that had to do with Apple or not. But beyond that, just curious what your thoughts were there.","Robert Perlmutter","Well I would say that in general most retailers would have said there was a sort of mix back-to-school, certain brands, certain categories did well others did not I think most are going in the holiday generally cautious with modern expectations. In terms of kicking up Apple sales benefited in the portfolio in September with the releases but are still down year-to-date.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","I guess for Chicago, does that asset get expanded anytime soon?","Art Coppola","Are you talking about Fashion Outlets of Chicago or North Bridge?","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","No, sorry, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, sorry.","Art Coppola","No.","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","And then going to the occupancy increase -- 130 basis points same-store, did anything stand out as impacting that disproportionately, either, say, on a regional basis or anything else?","Robert Perlmutter","No, I don\u2019t think so it was pretty much across the board in terms of quality of center or the regions.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just in terms of the acquisition that you expect to close by year-end, I was just wondering if you could maybe share whether it\u2019s a traditional mall asset or a mixed use or urban type asset, and then also whether it\u2019s located in an existing market where Macerich has exposure today.","Art Coppola","It\u2019s a full retail, no mixed use. It\u2019s in one of our gateway markets and again I can't project that it is going to happen because it is not under contract but my sense of it is, is that it probably may happen and but yes that's not built into our revised guidance numbers if we had built it into our revised guidance numbers, our guidance numbers would have gone up.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And with regard to The Gallery, really Philadelphia I guess just being a new market for Macerich, fits with your urban growth philosophy. Do you think that there are some other opportunities either in Center City or in the MSA or do you suspect that The Gallery will be a one-off opportunity in that market?","Art Coppola","I'd say it's one off for us in that market. I will remind you that we do have a full price mall not that far away which has been performing extremely well, Deptford Mall. But now it's -- we are thrilled to be there. It's a very, look it's in that DC New York corridors which has been so good to us and owning great assets in that market puts you in a unique position for retailers as they allow the expansion plans and Primark in particular for example, if you look at their initial expansion into the U.S. it is all in the Northeast including they are looking at Philadelphia, they are coming to Philadelphia and other markets in the Northeast which has been great for us.","Operator","We will go to next to Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs","You've had a lot of success adding fast fashion junior anchors like H&M, Uniglo, and Zara to your portfolio. Could you talk about what kind of rents those larger tenants pay and whether there's any instances of, call it, rent sacrifice as you merge the in-line higher rent paying tenants to create the larger stores?","Art Coppola","Well they don't pay enough rents, we will start with that. But that's what we tell them also. But I think it's a very good question and I think you are alluding to the answer which is you have to look at what it does for not only the square footage that you are dealing with of one of those significant users got also what the ripple effect and the domino effect is. Maybe Bob you could add some color to that piece of the question.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes. I mean, clearly, the larger format fast fashion apparel retailers negotiate their real estate very hard and they know the benefit that they bring locating in a center. So in terms of rents as Art said it\u2019s never enough in our mind but they do bring in important element to the property. One is the sales generation of incremental dollars which obviously allows us hopefully to capture market share. From a leasing standpoint, we often find not always but often find that their rental structure is often a push, a slight increase, a slight decrease to the rents that we have in place. But the real benefit is taking the retailers who are in place and relocating them elsewhere inside the shopping center often in lesser locations but generally at higher rents than the tenants that they were previously occupying the space. So most of the rent growth isn't in the fast fashion deal itself, that's generally more neutral, much of the benefit comes from moving the tenants that are inside their footprint to other locations in the mall at higher rents and improving the occupancies.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs","And then also back to the topic of occupancy costs. I know you guys have mentioned in the past that you think A mall occupancy costs could increase. I was just wondering, would you say that's more because of higher rents or lower sales? And then also do you think tenants are willing to pay for a show-rooming factor just to have a physical presence in your centers?","Art Coppola","Well it\u2019s actually the web-rooming is what's happening where people are researching online and then buying in the store which is really kind of the evolution of what show-rooming was with best buys and targeting post like that a few years ago in the press, but the rent growth in the great centers is in the recycling of the bottom 25% to 30% of the producers in any given center, out of the centers as you re-merchandize the centers constantly and bringing in retailers that are going to do better than the mall average and that's really a big source of rent growth in terms of the future and actually you can have rent growth and significant EBITDA growth in a great center and get the observed cost of occupancy as a percentage of sales even in a rising sales environment can go down because you are taking tenants that were paying you let's say 35% of sales doing 300 bucks a foot and you're replacing him with say a tenant is going to do pay 15% of sales and do a $1,000 a foot by way of example.","And you actually go forward in terms of your EBITDA, but you actually reduce your cost of occupancy as a percentage of sales. We've been saying that cost of occupancy as a percentage of sales is at best two dimensional and maybe not even that deep. You have to be very careful when trying to mark a shopping center, the market from a far just by looking at that one number. And so that's where we are trying to give full disclosure and as much disclosure on all of these metrics as we feel can be helpful to you but there is no sealing on our great centers, the opportunity really has nothing to do with the percentage of rent as a percentage of sales it\u2019s really bringing in the best retailers who, in fact they do pay for the opportunity to have the great flagship locations which further augments the overall omni-channel strategies.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","I\u2019ve got a question for you again on this group 5 and maybe this should go under the heading of no good deed goes unpunished. We do like the additional disclosure, but what strikes me looking at the numbers is that the metrics in those centers aren\u2019t really that bad. Sales per foot have been -- were slightly up over the last year, occupancy rate up quite a bit. Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales actually up, and yet we have negative 3.4% same-store NOI. What\u2019s the piece that I\u2019m missing that explains why in spite of relatively good metrics that the same-store NOI decline is so big?","Robert Perlmutter","Jim, this is Bob Perlmutter. A lot of it at the centers reflects renewal lease rates and much lower occupancy cost. So what you don\u2019t see is the tenant who expires and was on a rent based on at sales productivity 10 years ago that rose to a lower rent even though they stay in place and even though their sales don\u2019t change.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","And second question also, Bob, maybe you can address this. Talked about Kings Plaza in the prepared comments, and I know we saw maybe six months or so ago a spate of announcements or I think there were about three or four new tenants who were going to go in there that, I guess, should categorize as an upgrade, and I guess more in line with the type of tenant base at Queens Center. I wonder if you can give us an update as to what you are seeing there and your hopes for that center over the next year.","Robert Perlmutter","Well, from the leasing standpoint the team has made really good progress some of the new deals that have either opened or signed include Michael Kors, which is obviously a great addition to the center; Guess; Starbucks; KIKO Cosmetics, which is interesting. This is an Italian-based retailer that has come into the state. House of Hoops, Vans, Old Navy, Justice, so a combination of juniors and better quality specialty tenant so we\u2019re pretty pleased the centers started physical renovation or correcting all the deferred maintenance. So we feel like we\u2019re making real progress and of course longer term the opportunity there is to repurpose the Sears building.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. What is the timing on that, on the Sears building?","Art Coppola","We\u2019ll announce it when we have something specific to talk about on that. Right now we\u2019ve decided that we wanted to be to completely re-merchandize the center, but we felt that it was more appropriate to focus on the in mall space first and get a little traction there and give it some positive direction there before tackling the 330,000 square foot Sears conversation, which remains a conversation.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Paul Morgan with MLV & Company.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Just a couple of questions on Tysons, I mean you mentioned that that along with Queens and Kings as being one of the malls where, sort of counterintuitively, NOI hasn\u2019t gone up because of the transition on some of the leasing there. Could you talk a little bit about the upside that you think you will see in that wing and then maybe also a little color on just what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the impact of the Metro being open on traffic and sales?","Art Coppola","In 2005 when we bought Tysons our joint venture interest there and simultaneously went about the business of expanding the mall through the re-demise of the old JC Penny building and the addition of an entertainment wing, that expansion which is Bob you can help me with some numbers but it was over 150,000 split of space that went into that expansion and it would not at all surprise me if Bob would tell me we have 50% mark-to-market that in that space overtime period. But what happens is, is that particularly when you\u2019re dealing with renewals in a great center. The easy thing to do is to keep a tenant in place and take your rent increase and have no downtime but also not have a new tenant. The harder thing to do which sometimes comes at the short-term expense, quarterly earnings or quarterly same center NOI is to bite the bullet with an under productive tenant and to either relocate them to a lesser location in a center or just not to renew them and when you do that generally speaking you\u2019re talking about bringing in a retailer that\u2019s going to have the compelling use and you\u2019re talking about at least six to nine months minimum of downtime on the recycling at any one of those spaces.","And when you are dealing with centers where the rents are extremely high, you feel the pain. But it\u2019s the right decision to make for the center, and we've been through in 40 years of doing this, I've probably been through, I can't tell you how many tenure rollovers in our different properties, but this has what happens. And on the average properties, you tend to just renew, but on the great properties you tend to be very selective about renewing tenants and you only want to focus on the tenants that you believe can do significantly higher than an already higher sales per foot average at a mall. Bob do you want to just\u2026","Robert Perlmutter","Well the only thing is I would add is Tysons is one of the centers where we see the retailers seeking to put flagship stores for a variety of reasons that we discussed earlier. And really looking to upsize their store presentation there and most importantly willing to pay a premium for that upsize space. As Art mentioned, the mixed use development and the connection to the center sits in an area that has significant roll over, over the next two to three years. That's one of our best opportunities at the center and what we've done is we've sort of put together collection of flagship stores that bridge the entry from the mixed use into the mall. Long-term it\u2019s a very positive economic result it\u2019s a very positive result for merchandizing mix.","In 2014, we opened a two level Gap store, 2014 in a couple of weeks, we are also going to open a two level Zara store, in 2015 we are going to open up the two level two-level Victoria's Secret and PINK right at the entrance. And what it's doing is setting the stage for the releasing of this expansion wing over the next 24 months. In the short-term what it\u2019s done is it's created some vacancy that we are running at a lower weighted occupancy through 2014 which affects the year-over-year numbers. And as Art said, it\u2019s a major contributor to our income. In terms of sales, the sales in September were up 5.4% for the center, so again an indication that we are getting a very positive impact from the mixed use.","Art Coppola","If you have next time if you have an opportunity to be there, the activity that is happening and with the connection the train station and the plaza being open for business and the new traffic that's being generated to the second level what was a wing that was anchored with Lord & Taylor on one book-end and a theatre and Barnes & Noble in the other book-end has really created a new sense of 50 yard line of center of gravity for the center and the smart forward thinking retailers are grabbing, it\u2019s a land grabbing, they are grabbing and they are willing to pay. This is the counterintuitive one they are actually willing to pay more rent and sometimes more rent per foot for bigger spaces in a great location like Tysons Corner because all the other things that it does for them as a retailer.","Paul Morgan - MLV","So is '15 still sort of a transitional year in terms of the NOI there? And we should think of '16 as kind of where you will really going to get done and see all the uplift?","Robert Perlmutter","No we think a significant impact happens in both '15 and '16.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Great, thanks.","Art Coppola","But obviously we are making what we know is the right decision for the real estate. We are operating with all cylinders at this property are clicking at a very high performance level. And we still have many good things to come. We have the opening of the hotel coming up in a few months, the opening of the residential project, the complete fill up of the office tower and just the awareness that the project has gotten in the trade area. It\u2019s really, it\u2019s hard -- it's really hard to imagine that it\u2019s put Tysons back on the map because it always was on a global map. But it has really opened up our trade area and the traffic to the center of the rail stations and it\u2019s enabled the tourists that go to the capital to come out to Tysons without renting a car, without going through the expensive driving and the time commitments. So it\u2019s got a very bright future.","Operator","We will go next to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","So my first question is, I guess, more of a clarification and apologies if I missed this; it's been a long day, actually it's been a long week and it's barely Wednesday. Was wondering if you had factored in a faster pace of temp to perm into your original guidance which could perhaps explain some of the reduced outlook?","Art Coppola","I think we did touch upon it a little bit and one thing we did say. Tom you want to go ahead and jump in on that?","Tom O'Hern","Yes. It did change from initial guidance Haendel because as we mentioned earlier in the call, we had a significant amount of space that came from the bankruptcies of Love Culture and Coldwater Creek. And as a result some of that space has been temporary leased in the short-term as we pursue a permanent solution. So the number year-over-year was flat in terms of temporary occupancy to about 5.7%, our stated goal has obviously reduced that. So yes that did change subsequent to the initial guidance.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks for that. And secondly, on the I guess the CMBS financing environment for lower tier malls, given your activity in that segment I understand that LTVs for larger, more established sponsors on the CMBS side could approach 60%, maybe 70%, even if the property is in a secondary or even tertiary location. But I\u2019m wondering what the LTVs for local private guys could be is it 50%, 60%? And if that could be an issue or a limiting factor for you and perhaps some of your peers looking to sell some of these perhaps B and lower quality malls?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t see it as a limiting factor. I\u2019ve said before and it remains true today that the best friend of a buyer and best of the seller is a liquid debt market because of many of these buyers are not public companies and many of these buyers are willing to operate at higher leverage levels and if they can obtain the higher leverage levels it just gives them a projected return on their equity that is more attractive from their view point. One of the deals I mentioned that we are under contract right now in two transactions with buying groups that we had not previously done business with. And I think that each of them are looking at leverage levels that are in the zip code of the range that you\u2019d indicated that the big strong sponsors can get which is well over 50%.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate it, thank you.","Art Coppola","But I would not want to put us out there as an expert on the financing of B malls because that\u2019s just not much of our business anymore.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just a couple of quick follow-ups on The Gallery, you briefly mentioned that the rough early estimate might be 8% to 10% in line with your other projects type of return, but how about from a risk perspective? Is this a more -- I\u2019m not saying used the word slam-dunk, or is it riskier? How would you categorize this property?","Art Coppola","We feel even better about the opportunity today than we did four months ago and we\u2019re extremely confident that we can execute this redevelopment, and repositioning at returns that are consistent with what we should for at our best assets and we\u2019ll give more specifics on the opportunity as we get closer to the date that all the entitlements are finished up. But on a risk adjusted basis we feel very comfortable with this investment its sitting there with all of the benefits of the mass transit and it\u2019s ready -- it just received a big shot in the arm with the introduction of Centaury 21, so first major flagship outside of the New York area. And there is very significant retail demand that we\u2019ve been able to have in our conversations with the retailer. So we\u2019re very bullish on it. We feel actually stronger about the opportunity today than we did four months ago.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just last question. There is supposed to be talks about a casino going up maybe across the street or somewhere nearby. Is your personal view that that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing for a project like this?","Art Coppola","If I was a lawyer, I would say, asked and answered on the last call. We actually had that question asked and we did answer it on the last call, but I will answer it again. Look it all depends on what type of an operation goes into approximate area I can point to an example that SLS is doing a new luxury hotels just a couple of blocks away from The Gallery and that\u2019s a great sign. As to a casino, look, the interplay of the tourists that would come to a casino and the retailers that would be close to that operation, is a proven winning combination at numerous examples across the country. You can look to Rosemont as an example, you can look to our Niagara Falls as an example but -- you can look to Las Vegas as an example. Look at all the retail in Las Vegas that exists so well with casinos all around it or inside of it. So it\u2019s a proven -- casinos can generate great foot traffic, foot traffic can generate some great sales and good tenant. So it can be a good thing.","Operator","At this time I\u2019d like to turn it back to our speakers\u2019 for any additional or closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Alright, well thank you for joining us on our call. Look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next week and seeing hopefully at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks here at Santa Monica. So thank you for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter 2016 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and the supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC. Which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Robert Perlmutter, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and John Perry, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. With that I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with the past practice, we will be limiting the call to an hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call.","First quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolios, key operating metrics. We continue to execute on our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also recently completed the sale of the non-core mall. We'll talk about those in greater detail later on the call.","For the quarter, FFO was $0.87 compared to $0.79 for the quarter in March 31, 2015 negatively impacting the quarterly FFO results was $3.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt on the prepayment of the year ahead Town Center loan in January. Other things impacting the quarter, were same center NOI which increased by 7.5% compared to the first quarter of 2015.","We made significant expense cuts and initiated cost savings programs that started in the second quarter, 2015. So about a third of the same center NOI growth, this quarter comes from the impact of those expense cuts compared to the first quarter of last year. The balance of the growth was driven by double-digit releasing spreads annual rents increases and aggressive operating cost management.","Same center NOI growth for the balance of the year will obviously be less than the first quarter, as we get comp quarters that already had the impact of the expense cuts. Our estimate for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range. Gross operating margin at the centers for the quarter improved to 68.6% from 66.6% in the first quarter last year, bad debt expense was relatively modest at $1.2 million down from $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year.","As a result of a very attractive financing market, the average interest rate continues to be very low at 3.6% to although up, slightly from 3.49% a year ago. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape, at quarter end debt to market cap was 35.8%. The interest coverage was a very healthy 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2 times and the average debt maturity 6.14 years.","The financing market for a high quality regional malls remains very good, in addition to closing the previously announced Arrowhead Town Center loan in January. We have closed or committed on two other life company loans and we're in the market with a third. Subsequent to our purchase of Country Club Plaza, we put a $320 million loan in place that's 10 years fixed, with an interest rate of 3.85%.","We also committed to $375 million loan at the shops at North Bridge that's a 12-year fixed rate loan. The rate is locked to 3.68% and we should have closed that loan in the next few weeks. That refi will pay off the existing loan, which is $189 million with an interest rate of 7.5%. So effectively doubling the size of the loan and cut the interest rate in half.","We are also currently in the market for financing on Corte Madera and in addition to very attractive life company bids, we're also seeing some very competitive CMBS bids and that's for the first-time in the past six months or so and again, these are A quality models. I'm not sure that the CMBS market exists for all property types and qualities, but certainly for A quality models it seems to be coming back.","Looking at the stock repurchase program in mid-April as part of the previously announced $1.2 billion stock buyback approval. We entered into another accelerated stock repurchase program. We received 4.2 million shares when we started that program on February 18 and the balance of the shares worth to be delivered at the conclusion of that program.","On April 19, we completed the program and it had an average share price to Macerich's at $78.69. We received another 861,000 shares that have been retired. The total shares retired under both of the accelerated stock repurchase programs, we've completed is now 10.2 million at an average share price of $78.48.","Looking now at the FFO guidance, in our press release, we reaffirmed our original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15. There is only one assumption change and that is, in our initial guidance. We provided for the previously announced JV interest sales, but we did not include any impact of non-core asset sales.","In April, however we did sell Capitola Mall. Capitola it was a non-core asset for us, doing $350 a foot in sales and that was sold for $93 million. The Capitola sale will be dilutive to 2016 FFO by approximately $0.03 a share and that has now been factored into the guidance.","So another way to look at the initial guidance is that, it has been raised by $0.03. Other assumptions have remained unchanged and are detailed on Page 8 of our 8-K supplement that was filed yesterday afternoon. And just to remind you that our business in terms of FFO and NOI is seasonal and the quarterly FFO split we expect is, for the remainder of the year 23% of the yearly total in the second quarter, 26% in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment.","Bob Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Leasing activity during the first quarter remained strong. This reflects the high quality of the nature of the company shopping centers. I'll start with occupancy. Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.1%. This represents a 30 basis point year-over-year decline with the sale of Capitola Mall; it's been excluded from the calculation, while fashion outlets in Niagara Falls and South Park were included in the calculations having moved from the development portfolio into the stabilized portfolio. These three changes negatively impacted occupancy by 40 basis points.","Absent these portfolio changes, the occupancy level on a year-over-year basis increased by 10 basis points. Temporary occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 5.5%. Leasing spreads; our leasing spreads increased to 15.4% from 14.2% during the previous quarter. These spreads indicate continued strong demand for space in the portfolio.","As we've seen in previous quarters, our leasing spreads strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.44 per square foot. During the first quarter, a total of 733,000 square feet of leases were signed. The square footage of leases signed under 10,000 square feet was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2015.","Average term on leases signed in the first quarter was 5.8 years. Portfolio sales were $625 per square foot. This represents a 3% increase on a year-over-year basis. The impact of the previously mentioned portfolio changes reduced sales by $13 per square foot. Comparable center sales increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis and again, sales increases were strongest in the West Coast centers.","Categories that did well during the first quarter included beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear and athletic apparel, jewellery and restaurants. Bankruptcies; as discussed on previous calls, we approached 2016 cautiously. During the first quarter, the level of bankruptcies and store closures was low. Subsequent to the first quarter, PacSun entered bankruptcy.","Our exposure to PacSun has been reduced significantly since 2012, through disposition in re-tenanting. In 2012, there were 36 PacSun stores in our portfolio compared to 28 stores today. While too early to determine conclusively. We anticipate PacSun will attempt to reorganize with a smaller store count. PacSun represents approximately one half of 1% of the company's growth trends with average sales of $333 per square foot.","This is approximately half of the portfolio sales average. Their base rent is $47 per square foot, which is $9 per square foot or 16% lower than the average base rent in place at the centers, where PacSun is located. The statistics Aeropostale are similar. Since 2012, we have reduced the number of stores with Aeropostale from 44 to 27. They represent approximately one half of 1% of the company gross rents.","Sales are higher at $500 per square foot. We anticipate Aeropostale will reorganize with a smaller store count. Like expirations, we've witnessed the bankruptcies and store closures often present opportunities to improve the merchandise mix, increase sales productivity and generate higher rental income. While there is a short-term impact in terms of loss rent and re-tenanting cost, long-term the release into these spaces puts the center in a stronger position and increases net income.","Development, leasing at the development projects remains untracked and is nearing completion at two of the centers. At Broadway Plaza, we have signed leases for 89% of the expansion space, with another 5% approved and in documentation. We built a strong merchandize mix featuring a number of the leading lifestyle retailers and flagship stores to complement our existing anchors of Nordstorm, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. The next group of new retailers will begin opening this June.","Upon completion, Broadway Plaza will finally present sufficient speciality store space to serve this unique trade area. You will notice in this quarter supplement. The projected cost for Broadway Plaza was increased to $305 million. The increased cost are share of which is $17.5 million were the result of market conditions for constructions in San Francisco unforeseen site conditions and increased scope for the project, which was generated from retailer demand.","And an 8% stabilized return, the value from creation from this development is substantial given the quality of the asset. At Green Acres Commons, we have signed leases for 90% of the center with another 2% approved and in documentation. You will also notice in this quarterly supplement, the projected return on this project was increased by 100 basis points from 10% to 11%.","This increase in the stabilized return is the result of higher than budgeted rental rates achieved during the lease up. Finally, the leasing and construction are well underway for the fashion outlets of Philadelphia. We are pleased with the reception from the retail community today and anticipate strong interest from retailers at the upcoming ICSC show in Las Vegas.","So looking forward, we expect retailer demand for the centers in our portfolio to remain high. Rental rates on renewal leases, which represent almost two-thirds of our annual activity, remain strong. Many of our core tenants including category such as cosmetics, health and beauty, intimate apparel, athletic footwear, optical and jewellery are growing their core brands and developing new concepts.","There is increasing activity from established eTailers seeking a physical presence in our centers. Foreign retailers are entering and expanding their existing store base in the US and finally, larger format retailers continue to see expansion within the mall environment. So while we know, not all retail chains will succeed. We are certain that dominant retail locations will and with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks Bob. Thanks, Tom. And welcome to the call, as you can tell from reading our earnings release, we had a terrific start to the year on all fronts financial fronts, the operating results, re-leasing and leasing activity as well as the for the progression of our development pipeline. All our employees to deliver great growth for the year as well as incremental value for all of our shareholders.","I want to talk a little bit about capital allocation strategies. It's something that has been top of mind and many analysts mind lately. Especially given the substantial disparity between the NAV's, of most REITs and the private market evaluations and the discounts that REITs are trading at. Textbook theory would have you in situations like this, sell at higher multiples into the private markets and use that capital to buyback your stock in the public markets at lower multiples and that is exactly, what Macerich has done.","As you remember, we did our joint ventures that were announced about eight or nine months ago and then just recently closed in this quarter. We sold about 45% passive interest in several assets, eight assets that represented about 20% of the gross asset value of the company. So we sold an interest in around 9% to 10% of our view of the gross asset value of the company at private market multiples which are significant higher than public market multiples.","We took that capital that we announced the buyback program that would have us buying back approximately 10% of our stock in the public markets at significantly lower multiples, all with an idea towards capturing that differential. So we think that, in a very meaningful way that we have pursued a capital allocation strategy that makes all the sense in the world at this point in the cycle and at point in time for Macerich.","A collateral issue and related issue is portfolio management. We have indicated that, we will continue to selectively prune our portfolio and in this quarter, we were successful in announcing the sale of Capitola Mall. Capitola was a center that averaged mid $300 per foot. It's a very good property, but it had not shown the types of growth characteristics to some of our more urban assets have shown up for us and when you combine the sale of Capitola Mall and Panorama Mall about six months ago.","We sold two centers that average in the low $300 a foot for cap rates that were in the low 6s to the mid-6s. we raised about $200 million of equity from that and if you want to think about it from an portfolio management view point, in our mind that was the capital that we redeployed into the purchase of the 50% interest in Country Club Plaza, which is a center that obviously has much greater growth characteristics in the centers we sold and from the sales productivity view point, it does more than double the sales per foot of the two centers that we sold.","Going forward from a productivity view point and a disposition view point, we will continue to prune our portfolio we will use that lower bucket of assets to selectively and opportunistically raise capital going forward and we see the use of that capital really to be our source of capital or one of our sources of capital to fund our highly profitable redevelopment and development pipeline.","And now I want to look to comment on our view of retail demand and the convergence of technology and real estate which we think is something that is clearly going to happen this year. our view on retail demand as we've gotten into the year has only gotten to be more optimistic. Early on in the year, when we were very forthright about our view on the tenant bankruptcy some folks viewed that as being cautious. I'd say it was really more forthright.","Over the past several months, we've spent a lot of times talking to digital companies. Companies that currently do not do business in our malls and we found that their appetite to experiment with stores at our malls is extremely high. It's not about online versus offline anymore into the shoppers mind. It's all about the quality of the brand.","And if you have a brand that shoppers want, then shoppers do expect to be able to access that brand anywhere, anytime in a multiple manners through an omnichannel opportunity. Retailers continue to understand the importance between eCommerce, bricks and mortar and brand awareness. Rarely do we see retailers not making this three concepts together as they build out their retail platform.","There is increasing activity from established retailers seeking a physical presence, while small in terms of magnitude with the portfolio. The opportunity for growth is high, especially in better quality urban shopping centers. We believe that stores that are, we believe the stores located in centers that serve densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance as there is this convergence tech and brick and mortar.","A recently published study indicated that within a 30 minute drive time Macerich malls there is about on average 1.9 million that reside, that's about 50% greater than the average for the broader peer group, that's by design. We set out by design several years ago to concentrate on urban densely populated trade areas. We did this for many reasons; one of them has to do which is the fundamentals of supply and demand.","If you have a property that is in an urban location, it is very hard for competition to come in an impact you and most of all of our urban locations are must have retail locations. Retailers and eTailers as they think about it, they look at the dense population that we have around our shopping centers and they see our shopping centers as being their vehicle to serve the last mile to their ultimate to the consumer.","We're thinking about lots of opportunities to give access to our shopping centers for smaller digital retailers. And we believe after meeting with many of them over the past several months at the voting a tremendous amount of time and attention to this, that our very high barrier to entry shopping centers are also greatly in demand from the digital retailers of the world.","Now it's up to us to lower the barriers for them to figure out ways to do business with us and to reduce the friction, that is involved opening a store and we have several initiatives that are underway that will be developed and discussed further as the year goes on.","And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions and operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and we'll go first to Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","May be just a first question, if I could on 2016 guidance for Tom. I just wanted to clarify; you said you felt that net of the Capitola sale that you had raised your outlook by $0.03. I'm just curious is that because of the positive performance you had in Q1 or is that because your outlook for future quarters is improving?","Tom O'Hern","Jeff, it was a result of a strong quarter in the first quarter, part of that maybe timing differences such as recognition of lease termination revenue. We tend to back and wait those through the year, we had about $3.4 million that came in the first quarter, so for us to hold our range where it was originally, one with the $0.03 of dilution was because of the positive result in the first quarter.","Jeff Donnelly","It's helpful and maybe just a follow-up question for you Art, I'm not sure if you'll be able to talk about it, but I saw on the Proxy that you know one of the areas that you received kudos for in 2015 was a comprehensive succession plan was undertaken. Are there, are there any highlights from that you're able to share with folks on the call or is it?","Art Coppola","Really it's something that it's pervasive throughout the organization. So, there were about a dozen people within the organization that received new opportunities in an upwardly mobile manner. We have one of those individuals here on the call, with us Perlmutter who is promoted to be our Chief Operating Officer, but across the board Eric Salo was promoted to be our EVP of Strategic Initiatives in addition to Mall Operations. We have a new Head of Leasing, there were about a dozen people overall in all departments that received new responsibilities, this is just reflective of the deep bench that we have as well as a committeemen to provide that kind of mobility to our very talented team.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next we'll go to Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just wanted to go back to the comments that you had, all the discussions you're having with tenants that are currently online retailers that are looking to get into your stores and thinking about the stores as part of brand awareness type of campaign. Do you anticipate or was there any discussion about how the leasing economics might change at the mall as a result of sort of this integration of online and offline businesses?","Art Coppola","Yes, it's all being. First of all, there is going to be no rule of thumb because if there is then we're going to continue to have being difficult to approach. So, we're going to have to be just as creative as the people that we're trying to do business with. So in the beginning, there will be shorter lease terms, there will be pop-up stores that will be initiated, there'll be some rents that we think are really being paid for out of the marketing budget of the retailers, where they're looking to try and extend their brand awareness. It will be a much more creative and approachable restructure, with a hope and a view that as these retailers pan out, they will essentially have become incubated and then they'll be migrated into the more traditional long-term relationships that we have with the vast majority of our tenants.","But we see, we see great opportunity here, and the thing that I would say is that, my personal view on this is significantly more positive today than it was three months ago, and that's really a function of me personally, along with Eric who I mentioned was appointed to be Head of our Strategic Initiatives spending significant amount of time with early stage founders of eTail concepts. People that are somewhere probably between an angel series and a series A financing, they're just beginning to think about opening a store, they've had some success online, they have a brand that people seem to like a lot and when you meet with these folks, you go into it in the beginning and I said, I wonder if this is going to be a difficult conversation to convince them that they should be in this old school shopping mall. It's just the opposite.","There's been almost 100% success in conversion rate in the conversations, their appetite to be in the malls is just without question. They realize that these are the premier locations to give awareness to their brand, to get access to the customers, but the truth of the matter is that while our mall are high barrier to entry, at times the way we do business is also high barrier.","So we have to become a little more flexible and little more outward reaching and customer facing to the eTailers to provide flexible ways for them to experiment selectively in the malls. We're not going to dedicate 20% of any given mall to these emerging eTailers but you know there could be a percentage, there could be 5%, maybe 10%, I don't know we'll see. But the acceptance ratio and the quality of the conversations and the conversions into deals is causing me to be very optimistic and very convinced that 2016 is the year, where tech and real estate come together.","Everybody likes to refer to where we are in the economy etc. in baseball terms these days now that baseball season is in full swing. I would say, we're in the first inning, the top of the first inning in terms of the conversions of tech to brick and mortar, but that's the good news. I mean, we had a whole game to play this out, but the early results are really strong in my view. They're going to hard, they're not going to be moving the needle financially in early days here but it is going to create incremental demand, incremental excitement for our shoppers and I believe that it's going to change the face of our shopping centers going forward. To be determined, to be watched as the time goes on, but I sit here today very bullish and optimistic about the opportunity here.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks for that and are there certain malls that you think this will take place sooner rather than later, if we want to sort of get a first-hand look at how these things are evolving.","Art Coppola","Yes, we're going to its funny. These eTailers, you wonder if you have to convince them that they should be in the mall, they're pretty smart. When you talk to them and say, okay and now where would you like to be? They say oh, Santa Monica Place, Tysons Corner, Broadway Plaza, Corte Madera, Queens Center. It's like, I don't know if they're reading a supplement or what, but they're pretty smart in terms of what they're picking.","Now they're also picking and we're also focusing on digitally savvy communities. So Northern Virginia, New York City area and Southern California in particular Santa Monica is a great testing ground because it gives the brands the opportunity to show off their ideas for example here in Santo Monica to the community here, which 55% of our business community in Santa Monica is now digital. They call it Santa Monica Silicon Beach.","So you know the Bay Area, Southern California, Tysons Corner, places at North Bridge Chicago, Michigan Avenue, the Borough's in New York. These are the initial places that they want to experiment and we're fine with that.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Couple questions. first, why was 500 North Michigan pulled from a shadow pipeline and then second, can you give any update on the Candlestick development?","Art Coppola","No, big deal [ph] 500 is just that's, you know we had place to placeholder in there early on, as to what we thought we were to going to spend there. It's become increasingly apparent that it's going to be a completely tenant driven and development driven conversation, that number maybe high, maybe low, what we originally thought, as we developed an idea for what we are really going to do there, which is been partially influenced by our recent acquisition of the square block of Wabash which is really upgraded our thoughts. We'll bring it back into the shadow pipeline and the real pipeline. My guess is, the next time it comes back it will be in the real pipeline not the shadow.","As far as Candlestick goes, everything is proceeding well there. Our anticipation is that will open in late 2019 and could be earlier than that, but I'm not I doubt it, it's a very big development surrounding us and so there's tremendous amounts of infrastructure that are being put into place to enable to shopping center to exist, things that we don't control. So the opening day couldn't move around a little bit, one way or the other. But the demand has been very good from a retailer perspective and we take it has an opportunity to be a really great center.","Michael Mueller","When do you think, you'll start construction on that one?","Art Coppola","There's a huge amount of infrastructure that has to be done. So the actual start of our work it's actually quite late in the cycle. So it's almost two years from now.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And now we'll move to Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So just a few questions, first. Tom, on the stock buybacks you guys have a $1 billion till you've done $800 million, so the $400 million that's remaining didn't hear any mention of it in guidance. So one; is there any of it in guidance and two; what do you guys think as far as completing the rest of $1.2 billion or the $800 million is where you're now and there will always be some excess out there for future use, but nothing planned at the moment.","Tom O'Hern","Yes, the entire $1.2 billion was factored into the guidance. We felt the first two ASRs were fairly successful, so there's certainly a possibility we would do a third but for now that is in guidance.","Alexander Goldfarb","Tom, it is in guidance, right?","Tom O'Hern","Yes, it is in guidance.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay and then on the urban front. You guys mentioned that your malls are more urban so obviously more shoppers and at the same time, when you guys are walking through the NOI differences. Last year, you mentioned that higher cost of operating [indiscernible] urban led to differences in NOI margin, but just curious over the past six to 12 months there's certainly been a lot more initiatives on minimum wage in a lot of the urban areas, how is this manifested itself either in mall operations or in what the tenants are able to pay as far as rent or what have you? So basically, how is it impacted the mall business, if at all?","Art Coppola","It has not.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. thank you.","Art Coppola","I mean, there is you know, as that happens there would be one argument that would be that, as minimum wages go up, people have more money to spend, it's a sales going up. Does that counter act, the cost of labor, you know going up also, I don't know. The truth of matter is by the way, vast majority of our employees are already well above minimum wage anyway, so that does have impacts on restaurants and some retailers but the other plus side of that is, Chicago has the highest real estate taxes in the country, that doesn't drive retailers away from doing business in Chicago, they just accept the fact that if we're going to do business in Chicago, they're going to pay high real estate taxes.","Santa Monica, let's say it has a living wage that's inactive here, that's not going to drive people away from doing business in Santa Monica. It just, they realize that's part of the equation.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you, Art.","Art Coppola","I think it would be more of an issue in secondary less densely populated trade areas. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Market.","Todd Thomas","Just a follow-up on the stock buyback, so it's in guidance but it sounds like it's not something that's definitive at this time, which I think is a change in the messaging around that. I guess, based on your comments Art, in your prepared remarks around public and private evaluations. It would seem like a certainty. I'm just trying to understand whether you know anything has changed there with regarding to your plans to complete the full $1.2 billion.","Art Coppola","It's a certainty.","Todd Thomas","Okay.","Art Coppola","You can book it. As Hawaii Five-0 said, you can book em' Danno.","Todd Thomas","All right and then, I guess a follow-up for Tom on that, then with regard to the balance sheet. So after the sale of Capitola, the line balances are little under $700 million, add another $400 million on the stock buybacks and you still have to fund the development and redevelopment another $600 million or $700 million of pro rata spend there, so what's the plan to permanently finance a line and are you comfortable taking off leverage at this point in the cycle?","Tom O'Hern","Well, you've also got to keep in mind, Todd we've got Broadway Plaza coming onto, it's unencumbered today and we have very little NOI coming in from there. So that's going to come up, at the end of the day we're not to going to be taking leverage up much at all. Remember, we prefunded the buyback with the $2.3 billion we generated by selling the joint venture interest. So, unlike a lot of companies lever up to do the buyback we already raised the capital ahead of time.","In terms of the line, I mentioned a couple of financings. We're pulling a substantial amount of excess proceeds out of the North Bridge financing for example, we did the same in Corte Madera and in addition given the great financing market, we will probably put a long-term mortgage on Freshno Fashion Fair, which is currently unencumbered and that's about $340 million of proceeds that within the use to pay down the line of credit.","So we expect even after third ASR or however, we chose to do it to get the buyback up to the $1.2 billion that we would have a line that would vary between $500 million and a $1 billion, which is comfortable for us given that, we can take that line all the way up to $2 billion.","Todd Thomas","Okay and then, just one more, just follow-up on the eCom retailers that are opening stores and leasing space, you know how big of an opportunity is that as you see it today. is there any way that you can maybe frame it up for us a bit share with us, how you're thinking about as a potential opportunity over the next few years?","Art Coppola","I'm not ready to quantify for you, but it's the single biggest opportunity that I see. I'm absolutely certain that this is going to happen. I'm absolutely certain that it's going to be very incremental and I think it's going to be material, look we have to play the handout. There will be higher failure rates with experimenting with some of the eTailers which is one of the reasons, that we need to figure out a vehicle to allow them to experiment without a lot of friction or expense.","So we're working on a store model that makes the opening up a store for an eTailer much less costly and less risky for both of us. But I'm absolutely convinced that over the next three to five years that there will be an incremental 5% to 10% of our EBITDA will be coming from retailers that don't exist in the brick and mortar world today, and that's very significant when you add it all up.","Todd Thomas","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move next to Christy McElroy of Citi Bank.","Christy McElroy","Just on sales productivity, in looking at Biltmore, Scottsdale and Kierland, for all three sales are down about 3% to 5% year over year, is there anything market specific going on with traffic there? And then also what was the rationale for removing the Group Five property level sales leader?","Bob Perlmutter","I'll take the first part of that question. I don't think there is anything unique about Phoenix other than remember last year in the first quarter, the Super Bowl was in Phoenix was to boost activity at all the properties.","Tom O'Hern","And Christy in terms of the bottom section, the list there. It's only about 5% of our total NOI, so it's not terribly material, but we did find and it put us a little bit of a competitive disadvantage as we try to market some of those assets for sale to have the sales per foot number in there and we saw far more detrimental from a business standpoint then benefit for including those, so they've been taken out but again very material about 5% of our total NOI and hopefully, shrinking.","Michael Bilerman","Hi, Art it's Michael Bilerman speaking, one question. Question on sort of capital allocating and you talked in your comments about selling assets at private market pricing and being able to buy your stock at what you, and you used the word firmly in the press release, believe to be a discount to those values.","And so, as I think about as you sort of complete the $400 million, which we can book it and then you have the redevelopment and development pipeline, you have the same store growth that you're pushing, if the stock doesn't start to reflect what you firmly believe is NAV, after you do those three things, what do you?","Art Coppola","I don't know it's a same question that I think applies to 99.9% of the REITs in America. I think we're the only one that have taken significant action on that point. We're putting; we're taking action that expresses our conviction in these beliefs. We're delivering significant I think value back to our shareholders through the special dividend that we paid, as well as the stock buyback and we'll revisit that as we get closer to finishing up the initially announced stock buyback, but again I would point out, we're the only REIT that has done this in our space, in this material or the way. And yet, we all are faced with exactly the same issue.","It's a matter of fact, several analyst believe that other mall REITs are trading at even greater discounts to their NAV than we are.","Michael Bilerman","Right I wouldn't agree with that, it was just that, whether you had something else in mind to help narrow that GAAP.","Art Coppola","It's not a unique issue to Macerich and we're only one that has done anything about it, in a material way.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, fine thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Quick question on your same store NOI, how much of that did it get benefit from some of your development or redevelopments they included in this year's comp?","Tom O'Hern","We don't include redevelopment or development unless they've been in for the full period for both periods. I mean others in the sector do include it, but we don't include it. So if it was Broadway Plaza probably won't be included same center NOI until about 2019 for example, even though rents to NOI start coming online. I mean we think that's an artificial boost to same center growth number and we don't do it.","Ki Bin Kim","But how about Tysons, which I believe has been in both periods.","Tom O'Hern","Well Tysons office has been in for both periods and is included. I wouldn't say it's materially change that number. Tysons apartments are not included in the hotel it's not included because they haven't been in for the full period in both.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay and if I look at our expense margins and I'm just looking at management company expenses and shopping centers expenses as a percent of base rent. It seems like in the first quarter it went up to like 71% which is a bit higher than normal, with your recovery ratio is going down a little bit, on bad calculation just curious if there was anything unusual or seasonal in there?","Tom O'Hern","Well, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. We do have a seasonal business. So you can't look at the gross margin for example based on necessarily on one quarter and compare it for the prior quarter because we have 30% of our FFO comes in the fourth quarter. So to compare that, to compare the fourth quarter of 2015, to the first quarter of 2016 on most metrics is inappropriate you need to compare it to the same quarter of the prior year.","And as I mentioned, and this does not include the management company but we look at operating margin keyed in, as I said before operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 68.6% compared quite favorably to the first quarter of last year, which was 66.6%.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, I was looking at it year over year. I probably should have clarified. But I guess we can take it off-line.","Tom O'Hern","Okay, happy to do that.","Operator","And now we'll move to Paul Morgan with Canaccord.","Paul Morgan","Just going back to the eCommerce thing one more time. I mean, given all the discussions you've been having recently, I mean does it make, you think any differently about the kind of keepers and assets you might look to sale just in the context of new generation of retailers maybe thinking differently as they role these things out. I mean, obviously it seems like kind of traditionally new retailer look to start with a lot of high-end malls, but maybe the kind of if eRetailers are thinking about it, as much from a initially from a marketing perspective, the tone of the discussion is different. I mean is there any kind of takeaway from those conversations that pertain to your kind of your asset management?","Art Coppola","Well little bit, I mean more in the context that it validates all that we've been doing over the past five years in continuing to upgrade the quality of our portfolio, really focusing on assets that are in the heart of the last mile and that's really the issue, if you're talking about one is a digitally born retailer think about. I think they think about the last mile, they don't necessarily think about high end because lot of the goods digital retailers are selling are not high end.","And so, I do think they think about where would I like to be, where I can give to you know the digital world they think about eyeballs [ph] in the physical world they think football. So where can I go that's got a lot of foot traffic, where can I go retailers are proven winners, where can I go that you know is in the heart of a densely populated trade area.","All of those factors that I think will influence where the retailers of the world will want to initially migrate really puts us in a perfect position to service their needs. How far will they go beyond that time will tell? I mean, there's one case to be made in my mind that certain digital retailers will actually be, will do really well in secondary and even tertiary markets. Where they can access a market and provide an exciting retail experience to that market that market normally, that those shoppers wouldn't otherwise be exposed to, time will tell but I'm absolutely convinced the convergence is happening.","If I had to put it in terms of where we are in the cycle like I said, first setting but I think it's going to be a real source of excitement for our properties and profits.","Paul Morgan","Great and then just kind of separately.","Art Coppola","And I would also say, the opportunity from this new retail demand dwarfs the old school retailers that may file bankruptcies and shrink their store counts overtime.","Paul Morgan","I mean, how many chain would you that you've spoken to or you think you could open a store there is kind of in the next 12 months?","Art Coppola","More than dozen, but I'm not going to name, names.","Paul Morgan","Okay, that's helpful. And then just second question on occupancy, just there are few malls that big dips quarter-to-quarter so Corte Madera, Santa Monica, Stonewood, anything specific is that going to bounce back or going down there?","Tom O'Hern","Sure, Corte Madera and Santa Monica these are centers that have pretty small middles. So a couple of bigger tenants moves can affect the occupancy. At Corte Madera, Banana Republic had an 18,000 foot store, two levels and we relocated them into new 9,500 foot store. So that impacted the occupancy and at Santa Monica place, we had a bankruptcy with Kitson which is actually as we talked about earlier great opportunity long-term in terms of improving quality, improving rent and in the short-term might be an opportunity for some of the digital efforts that are being discussed and then we actually had a lease with CB2 that we as the landlord terminated. So those affected the occupancy in the first quarter.","Paul Morgan","Okay, great thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","This is actually Caitlin Burrows. I had a question regarding the share repurchases that you did in the first half and those that you planned to do in the rest of the year. Does that give us good reason to think in 2017 should see extra strong earnings growth or is there, some other separate moving part that could limit that potential?","Art Coppola","Look you got a lower share count, you have the same amount of revenue growth of the properties. I think that does translate into a lift to your growth momentum, that's really part of the reason. It's a really very good question actually, a lot of people focus on the - the one-time discrepancy between private and public market values but what they don't focus on, it's a very good point. Is that by reducing the share count, if you still have the same fundamental positives at a property level, then it does accelerate your EBITDA growth rate. So yes, I'm afraid that answer is yes.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay and then I was just.","Tom O'Hern","Well, I don't think we're in position to give guidance yet for 2017.","Art Coppola","Well I'm talking, I'm only talking academically and intellectual purity.","Tom O'Hern","Well I would just say perhaps in addendum to your comment, then that would maybe acceleration of EBITDA per share.","Art Coppola","Okay, thank you. Because you've got the lower share count, good point.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay and then just on the sales side. You guys obviously breakout your sales by buckets and even at your top properties it was, some good growth overall in the trailing 12-month. So I was just wondering, if you had any idea versus what's some of the other A malls have been reporting in that tourist and their spending have been negatively impacting them, how your portfolio has been able to still generate growth and kind of be okay, even despite that.","Tom O'Hern","Well, I think we talked about it in one of the previous calls. We don't have a huge exposure to many of the traditional tourist markets. We do have certain properties like fashion outlets in Niagara or Santa Monica that have a big tourist element.","Art Coppola","And Arizona.","Tom O'Hern","And Scottsdale as well.","Art Coppola","We're not immune",".","Tom O'Hern","Right, but the New York properties are not really tourist based and so our portfolio is probably non-influenced by those factors.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay, thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you. I think we've got time for one more question. Operator, do we have other questions.","Operator","Certainly. We'll take that question now from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America","Craig Schmidt","This is I guess for Bobby. Bobby, heading into 2016 you perhaps had a more cautious view of store closings, now that we're four months in, is it as you expected or are you still looking for more shoes to drop?","Bob Perlmutter","No, I would say within our existing tenant base nothing that's occurred during the first four months is really a surprise to us. So I think it's pretty much along the lines than we've expected. I think there is certain elements that have done better maybe that we had expected, [indiscernible] a little bit on the emergence of eCommerce, retailers into the shopping centers. We've seen increasing activity albeit small in terms of numbers. We're seeing increasing activity from that sector, so that's been a positive.","The leasing on the development project it has been strong. So I would say within the existing tenant base and sort of as expected and some others continue to remain strong.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, great and then just a little bit about fashion outlets in Philadelphia you mentioned things are going well there, are you successful in winning some important food components to come to this project.","Bob Perlmutter","We think food will be a big part of the merchandize mix and we think there is some really good opportunities in particular because of the market and the nature of smaller shop opportunities in the market. So that's our restaurant group is very focused on that and we do see that as an opportunity given the downtown location and then transportation system.","Art Coppola","And the addition of a lot of new hotels and residential, it's just part of the overall fabric of downtown Philadelphia has seen a tremendous amount of new restaurant activity which is really a function I think of servicing the incremental residential population as well as tourist that are there. So we're just part of that and we benefit from that, so yes.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","All right, thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you next month, so lot of you NARIET and look forward to reporting on the balance of the year.

[Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and the supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC. These are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President Leasing; John Perry, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. With that I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with the past practice, we will be limiting the call to an hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean.","The fourth quarter reflected continued operational excellence as evidenced by the strength of our key operating metrics. We saw the successful completion of our joint venture strategy, the completion of a number of highly attractive financings, the reinvestment of capital into our best assets through redevelopment and share buybacks. We will talk about these in greater detail later in the call. We continue to see very significant benefit from our efforts in 2012 through 2015 to sell non-core slower growing assets and redeploying that capital into higher quality, more productive assets.","Looking at the leasing activity, we had good volume in the fourth quarter. We signed \u2013 on leases under 10,000 square feet, we had 313,000 square feet signed, positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 14.2%.","Looking at mall occupancy, it came in at 96.1%, up 30 basis points from 12\/31 of \u201814 and up 70 basis points from our occupancy level at the end of the third quarter. Average mall store base rents also increased to $54.32, up from $51.15 a year ago.","FFO for the quarter came in at $1.12 that compared to $0.99 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Same center NOI increased by 6.4% in the quarter and year-to-date NOI \u2013 same center NOI growth was a sector leading 6.5%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management.","Looking at the gross margin at the centers, it improved to 71% for the quarter, up from 68.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the year-to-date margin it improved by 250 basis points to 69.3% compared to 66.8% for the full year 2014.","Bad debt expense for the quarter was up slightly at $1 million compared to $800,000 in the fourth quarter last year. The average interest rate at 3.6% was slightly higher than 3.48% average rate at the end of 2014.","The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, looking at the key balance sheet metrics, debt to market cap was 34%, interest coverage ratio was a very strong 4.0 times, debt to EBITDA on a forward basis 7.2 times. The average debt maturity, and this is after the Arrowhead financing and the closing of the joint ventures, is six years, up significantly from a few years ago.","We did a total of about $3 billion in financing in 2015, and within the past quarter, we did $1.8 billion, they could include Arrowhead, 12-year loan, $400 million at 4.05%. Los Cerritos, another 12-year loan at 4%. Washington Square, a $550 million loan, 3.65%, seven years. South Plains, Twenty-Ninth Street also refinanced. So that was $1.825 billion in financings, average tenure of 10.1 years at an average interest rate of 3.94%.","In mid-November, we set about to execute on our $1.2 billion of approved share buyback. We engaged an investment bank to do a $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program. At the beginning of that program, we received and retired 4.1 million shares when the plan started, which was November 13, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered based on the average daily volume adjusted price of MAC during the buying period, less a negotiated discount.","On January 20, 2016, the ASR program was completed. Effectively MAC bought back $400 million worth of shares at $78.26. We received another 971,000 shares at that time. So this program, the first ASR under the $1.2 billion program retired in total 5.1 million shares. Also since the last call, we had two special dividends that resulted from the joint venture transactions, they reached $2. One was paid in December and one in January.","In our press release this morning, we provided 2016 FFO per share guidance, the range was $4.05 to $4.15. The guidance assumptions included same center NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is very significant given that 2015 is a tough comparison year having come in at 6.5%. The acquisition and guidance includes a $330 million of our share of Country Club Plaza, which has been previously announced and also reflects roughly $1 billion of dispositions, which relates to the joint venture interest that we closed in January with Heitman and GIC.","The other assumptions are included in the 8-K supplement filed last night. Our NOI guidance for 2016 is consistent with the guidance we gave in early 2015 after adjusting for the impact of the joint ventures.","At this point I would like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. The leasing activity during the fourth quarter remained strong reflecting the high quality nature of the company's shopping centers. Occupancy increased to 96.1%, which represented a 30 basis point year-over-year increase. Permanent occupancy ended the year at 90.5%, temporary occupancy increased to 5.6%, which reflects the bankruptcies incurred at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015.","During 2015, a total of 250,000 square feet was converted from temporary to permanent occupancy. Leasing spreads were 14.2%, again indicating strong demand for space in the portfolio. Leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed in 2015 was $57.41 per square foot, this represented a 5.4% increase over the prior year. During the year, we signed leases for approximately 4 million square feet which was a 2.4% increase over 2014. The average lease term for leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years.","Portfolio sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $635 per square foot. Comparable center sales increased by 7.6% year-over-year. Sales increases were highest in the West Coast and Arizona centers. And during 2015, sales were positively impacted by: one, high-volume tenants; two, strong categories such as home furnishings, jewelry, cosmetics and athletic footwear; three, organic growth from merchants with strong brands; and four, store closures of underproductive tenants.","Tourism. While our portfolio only has moderate exposure to international tourist and luxury business, we have seen certain centers impacted by tourism and the stronger US dollar. Most notable in our portfolio is Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls whose sales have been impacted by the steep decline in the Canadian dollar.","Holiday sales. Most retailers are indicating holiday sales were in line with our expectations. Black Friday sales are being distributed over most of the week starting with pre-Thanksgiving sales. Retailers are also reporting the last few days before Christmas as well as the post-Christmas activity was stronger than expected. Many retailers were promotional to up the entire season, we believe this is likely to increase the strain on those stores under financial pressure. In general, it appears that specialty stores fared better than department stores during the holiday season.","2014 and 2015 bankruptcies. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect bankruptcies and rent relief requests in 2016 to be at similar or higher levels than in 2015. This is reflected in our 2016 forecasts. We believe many of these retailers are likely to restructure and reduce the number of locations within their fleet as opposed to liquidate the entire chain. This is likely to impact lower productivity centers to a greater degree.","During 2014 and 2015, there were 11 major store closings or bankruptcies that impacted 134 stores or 413,000 square feet within our portfolio. The average rent for these stores was $54 per square foot, they generated sales of $241 per square foot and had an occupancy cost of 22.6%. As of 12\/31\/15, 66% of the space has been re-leased resulting in a significant upgrade to the merchandise mix, improved sales productivity and a rent spread in the high-single-digits.","eCommerce. We are continuing to learn how retailers use their brick-and-mortar stores as a key component to support growth in their eCommerce sales. A number of important trends are emerging. One, the brick-and-mortar stores are integral to the eCommerce efforts. Two, BOPUS, bought online, picked up in stores, is becoming increasingly important to retailers. Three, online sales have a high percentage of returns especially on apparel. Four, physical store sales are reduced by online returns, which reduces reported sales for brick-and-mortar locations. Five, the customers enter the mall equipped with more information from the web than ever before. Six, pure eTailers are migrating into brick-and-mortar stores generating new leasing opportunities. And seven, physical store presence improves online sales.","These trends are supported by recent customer research conducted at a cross-section of Macerich centers. The research indicated that lower average expenditures and shorter trip durations were more than offset by increased frequency of visits and higher conversion rates. We firmly believe that stores located in densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance to the retailer.","Big boxes. Throughout the portfolio, there is strong demand for big box users larger than 10,000 square feet. We have increased our exposure with retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Home Goods, Ulta and Nordstrom Rack. These retailers have opened stores across the portfolio including enclosed centers, open air centers as well as lower productivity centers. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with JCPenney at Inland Center to open in the former Gottschalks building. JCPenney is on track for an opening in the fourth quarter of 2016.","We continue to devote additional resources to activate the common areas of our centers. Efforts are orientated towards permanent kiosks and business development opportunities as well as incubation of online retailers into physical stores. Multiple goals for the common area include revenue enhancement, improved presentation and an elevated customer experience.","Development, leasing at the development projects remains on track. At Broadway Plaza, we have 87% of the expansion space under executed leases. We are very pleased with the merchandise mix and eager for the majority of the expansion to open during the second quarter of 2016. This will add to our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. At Green Acres Commons anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, we have 85% of the space under executed leases and are anticipating a third-quarter opening in 2016.","Finally, we have completed the public financing agreements and are moving forward with the development of Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia in partnership with PREIT. This project is anticipated to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019 and will incorporate approximately 775,000 square feet of retail area. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Bobby. Thanks, Tom. That\u2019s a lot to cover, so I'm going to cover just a few other items and then we will open it up to Q&A. As you can see, our operating results were terrific on every level, whether it be margin improvement, occupancy levels, rents that we have in place in the portfolio, re-leasing spreads, all of these are factors that contributed to a very significant same center NOI growth rate in 2015 and gives us optimism into the future as to our growth patterns over the next couple of years.","It is hard to predict what is going to happen, obviously, in the retail broader environment. And there are many factors that could influence that up or down. But we recognize that if you think about all of the different levers that we can pull that can create shareholder value, that there probably is no lever more important than having the maximum possible same center NOI growth pattern.","Developments, redevelopments, these are also extremely value creation, but they obviously have capital that gets deployed as part of that process. It is a permanent lever that we will be pulling in the redevelopment arena or the new development arena. And we\u2019ve got a very strong track record of positive results from those activities and we anticipate that the projects that are underway right now will continue to drive value for us going forward.","Another lever that we didn't anticipate that we were going to be able to pull that gave us the opportunity we feel to create value here was the selective disposition of a non-core asset, Panorama Mall in November of this past year. And the agreement with Macerich and Taubman to purchase Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Highwood Properties. That closing is anticipated to close March 1st. The gross price is $660 million with a 50% anticipated loan to value that we anticipate will be put on the property. Most all of our equity will be funded through the disposition proceeds that we generated from Panorama.","Country Club Plaza is an iconic 15 block 1.3 million square foot mixed-use retail and office property located in the heart of Kansas City. It is well known throughout the industry and we believe that, jointly with Taubman, we will be successful in taking that property up to an even higher level of performance from where it is right now.","We are very pleased to have completed the joint ventures that we did. That was a very significant and large capital decision, a capital recycling decision. And to effectively have raised new capital in the private markets through joint ventures, that was used to fund either -- both the special dividend that we paid out as well as to fund the stock buyback program that we have announced. And we are pleased that just a couple of months after announcing the $1.2 billion authorization that we have got over a third -- we've got about -- a third of that has been accomplished and delivered to date. So we\u2019re very happy about that.","The status on the new developments, I think we are in very good shape there. If you take a look at Philadelphia, the redevelopment of Broadway Plaza, the addition of the theater at Santa Monica Place, the expansion of Green Acres, the recycling of the Sears building ultimately at Kings Plaza, and Fashion Outlets of San Francisco, we think we are in a very good position for those projects to deliver good shareholder value into the future.","But again, I would reiterate that obviously on a risk-adjusted basis we see the opportunity to generate strong same center NOI growth as being one of the most attractive levers that we can pull in creating shareholder value. ","So with that, operator, I would like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Hey. Thanks. In thinking about comping against the tougher same-store NOIs, how much more room do you have in terms of the aggressive operating cost management?","Tom O'Hern","Craig, some of that will flow into 2016. We really set out to do that in the second quarter, so we will probably have a quarter and a half of that which will positively benefit 2016. We really pretty aggressively manage those, we will continue to do that. But I don't think we will see the same kind of cuts in 2016 as we had in 2015. It is hard to duplicate. I think we can maintain what we did, but it is going to be hard to replicate the same amount.","Craig Schmidt","And then -- and when thinking about possibly selling some more of your non-core assets, how many more assets would you like to sell out of the portfolio?","Art Coppola","We really don't have a number, per se. It is really opportunistic at this point. We've really taken the portfolio in terms of its composition to where we wanted to get it with well over 95% of our NOI being fortress type of income. So, anything that we do going forward, the way that we think about it is that dispositions will be there as a source of capital for us over the next say three to five years to fund opportunities whether they be development, redevelopment or potentially even an acquisition of something. ","So there is no specific number, but we clearly do intend to periodically continue to prune the portfolio and to recycle the capital. Funding the purchase of a great center like Country Club Plaza with the disposition of a very mature kind of enclosed community center equity source of capital is really, from my viewpoint, a great trade for the company. And likewise, funding development and redevelopment capital going forward through selling off non-core assets is also, to me, a very sensible thing to do.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Hi. I have two quick leasing questions. First, where do you see lease spreads settling in 2016? It looks like you ended 2015 with about a 14% average. And then, Bobby, I think you said that the average duration on leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years. And just out of curiosity, is that shorter than it has historically been and can you give us a little color on that?","Robert Perlmutter","Sure, in terms of the first question, our target is to maintain mid-teen spreads. The nature of the statistics, sometimes it will bump up, sometimes it will bump down. But our goal is for mid-teen spreads. And we believe based on current market conditions we can achieve that. In terms of the average lease term, it's actually increasing. As the portfolio has improved in quality over the last three years, we have seen that number increase to longer durations.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Going back to your comments on retailer bankruptcies that might be a little bit more this year than last year. How much of that is actually configured into your guidance? I see that your bad debt expense is kept flat from an assumption standpoint this year versus last year while your lease termination income ticked up $5 million. So I was just curious if you\u2019ve taken some kind of reserve for those expectations?","Tom O'Hern","Well, it's resulted in more conservative revenue assumptions on the lease up. There has been some rent concession conversation that has also been factored into the 2016 guidance. The increase in lease termination revenue is just because we currently are in discussion with a number of tenants so that is a specific number. Generally we assume $10 million to $11 million going into a year as our assumption based on history.","And so, we still have that general assumption, but we had a few specific tenants that we have been negotiating with, which is also a byproduct of what Bobby said is typically when you have times when you have store closures it is not always bankruptcies and it can tend to lead to more lease termination revenue.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, and just a follow-up. Bob, I mean we are a couple of months more into it than your last conference call. Anything incremental that you've discovered more on your retailers?","Robert Perlmutter","I would say not really. We haven't noticed a significant difference in discussions with tenants. The tenants that we are in discussion is pretty much the same group as we talked about in the third quarter. So, I think the holiday season didn't provide any surprises negatively or positively.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we have Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hello. Good morning out there. Just a few questions. First, on the same-store NOI guidance, I think on the second quarter call last year, you guys talked about trying to maintain sort of a 6% number, sort of like what you delivered in \u201815 over the next few years. This year the NOI guidance is below that, but yet the bottom-line FFO number exceeds what the Street was expecting. So, can you just help us walk-through if we should expect same-store NOI to get back to that 6% number? Or maybe there are some non-same-store items that are really driving the FFO beat relative to consensus. ","Tom O'Hern","Yes, the two -- well first I will take the NOI question, Alex. There was a comment made in July of \u201815 that you know it was a caveat that it wasn't guidance, but that internally we were hoping to see same center NOI growth as 6% over the next couple years. And you very well -- when you combine 2015 and 2016 it could average to close to 6%. I will say that subsequent to July the leasing environment has been viewed more cautiously as before. In fact, looking at some comments made by my colleague to my right here, Bob Perlmutter, one of his quotes was looking towards the end of the year we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years.","And he went on at some length, in fact, to the extent that internally he earned himself as a result of that call the nickname of Dark Cloud. So I would say that through the second half of the year we became more cautious as it related to the leasing environment and that certainly affected the 6% growth rate that had been discussed earlier in the year. In terms of the FFO number, a lot of components in there, Alex. Obviously the joint ventures which happened late in the year, all financing activity which came in at extremely attractive rates, all those things affected the FFO number, as well as the buybacks and the accretion from those. We did have a lot of cash on the balance sheet which is dilutive. So there are many factors that went into the ultimate FFO number.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is on the development schedule, one, it looks like a few projects got pushed back a year. Maybe it is just as you get more into planning stuff trues up. But also the spend on Philly increased as well as the time line lengthened. So if you could just provide some perspective on that?","Tom O'Hern","Sure. I\u2019ll take Philly and then I will let Bob talk about the timing. On Philly in the shadow report we have been netting out the city assistance. There is roughly $90 million of city assistance which has been to a large degree solidified. And so, we are now showing the gross number for the project and not netting it by the city assistance. Most of that city assistance will come in the form of a TIF. And under GAAP, TIF income is recognized as income, not a reduction of costs. So that\u2019s why that is grossed up. It really hasn't been as a result of a change of the scope of the project.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes, Alex, in terms of timing, I don't think it is anything significant other than really working through the pre-development process. Both of these projects are complicated projects. They are mixed use projects and it's taken some time to get it through the pre-development process, get the pre-leasing commitments that we needed and ultimately move them to the under construction pipeline.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay and then just finally on Philly then. Tom, if the city assistance is now in the gross number, the yield -- is the yield that we should think about the project returning, is that on the net basis or that\u2019s inclusive of the gross of the city's contribution?","Tom O'Hern","It is a function of the gross cost and the income from the TIF is included in calculating that 8% return.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","It really is a function of just following GAAP on that. We weren't sure in the very beginning exactly what the format would be of the various assistance vehicles that we were able to attain. But the one -- and we exceeded our expectations on that side of things. So we are ready to go and it is really just now, as we move it into the in-process pipeline, taking a look at how the GAAP numbers would require us to treat it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.","Todd Thomas","Appreciate the comments around eCom and brick-and-mortar. Just given all of those comments around buy online, pickup in-store and the impact returns have on store sales, how are conversations changing with retailers when you negotiate leases? And how are you setting rent with all of those factors in mind?","Robert Perlmutter","This is Bob Perlmutter. I think your initial reaction is, well, we want to capture these sales for percentage rent. But that is not really the way we are looking at it. What we are really trying to do is understand the amounts and the impacts of all of the different eCommerce strategies on the brick-and-mortar. Not with the goal of gaining more percentage rent, but with the goal in terms of understanding how important these locations are with the retailers.","So, we\u2019re learning, we are teaming up with certain outside professionals, we are using rights we have under our lease. And it is really to understand how the physical store influences the eCommerce. And it is more than just what are their reported sales.","Art Coppola","Also just to add to that. Look, we think of ourselves as an omni-channel landlord, an omni-channel owner. And in that context, we see our duty and our opportunity to our retailers to be not only to provide them with the physical space in the mall, but to also support other activities that they have like buy online, deliver from store -- things of that nature. So it\u2019s an evolving business, but the one thing that is clear to us -- and this kind of goes back as a follow on to some of the same center conversations.","I\u2019d say that the most important factor that drives your same center NOI growth is the leasing demand and the rents that you can achieve. And our team -- and we are not unusual, but our team is extremely well aware of what these locations are worth to retailers. And there is no science that they should pay X percent of sales per se. We just factor everything in and the mark-to-market that we have been able to put up over the past many years has been with double-digit leasing spreads.","And we see the opportunity to continue those kind of spreads as being very clearly in front of us. And the evolution of brick-and-mortar retailers into more omni-channel retailers makes physical stores more valuable to them. They\u2019re valuable not only from the viewpoint of what they sell from the store, but they're also valuable as a service to their customers, for customers to buy online and then bring it back to the store and exchange it for something else.","So, they think of all of their activities and, as Bobby was saying, it\u2019s really -- it is not so important, the exact sales number, it is really more having a knowledge of what is important to that particular retailer and then that helps you to drive the rents. And if you have must-have real estate, which is our goal here, then you are able to put up very good numbers.","Todd Thomas","All right, thank you. Just lastly, apologies if I missed it. But Tom, typically you\u2019ve given the quarterly percent weighting of FFO throughout the year. Do you have that by chance?","Tom O'Hern","We will provide that later, Todd, I don't have that with me at the moment.","Operator","And next we have Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","I have a question for Dark Cloud actually. Mr. Cloud, your mall landlord friends this quarter on their calls have specifically said that bankruptcies are going down in 2016 versus 2015. And I am curious, are the tenants that you are concerned about in their properties too or are you seeing unique guys in your properties I guess, in your portfolio that aren't in theirs?","Robert Perlmutter","I really can't speak for the other companies. I can tell you that the tenants that we are dealing with obviously have footprints beyond our centers. And again, none of the groups that we\u2019re speaking with would be a surprise to anybody given the press and the public markets pricing of these retailers.","Art Coppola","Rich, I really wouldn't -- look we are trying -- people love to have a pulse on where we see the near-term for the business. Look, I hope that Bobby's caution here is not reflected in increased bankruptcies. I hope that we have fewer. But we\u2019re really just trying to give you our all-in view of where we see things. But I would want to reiterate that in putting out the results that we just have attained in 2015 and as we see the opportunities into 2016, we see the demand for our properties to be very strong. So maybe we\u2019re being a little too cautious, time will tell. But we are telling you what\u2019s in our assumption and assumptions are exactly that.","Robert Perlmutter","In terms of the tenant bases, they are spread throughout the portfolio. In terms of when the tenant ultimately comes and makes a decision on which stores to keep, the potential is always the lower quality assets will be more effective through store closings.","Paul Adornato","Okay. And could you maybe go through the tiers and let us know where the occupancy costs are across the portfolio?","Robert Perlmutter","I am not sure that we disclose that information in the supplement.","Paul Adornato","Okay, then as an alternate, can you tell us what sales growth --","Robert Perlmutter","I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay, it\u2019s in the supplement. So you\u2019ve got the top 10 assets, the cost of occupancy was 13.4% and those top 10 assets generated 28% of our NOI, but if you go through page 13 and 14 ","Art Coppola","They are relatively stable throughout the --","Robert Perlmutter","In the supplement you are going to see that it is pretty much an average of mid-13 occupancy for every grouping.","Paul Adornato","Okay. And finally, was wondering if you had sales growth productivity excluding Apple and then excluding Tesla.","Tom O'Hern","No, we are not going to disclose that information.","Paul Adornato","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we have Christie McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning, guys.","Art Coppola","Hi, Christy.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Just following up on your greater caution in 2016 contributing to that more conservative same-store NOI guidance, are you expecting re-leasing spreads could potentially compress or see a potential occupancy decline over the next year? And are you changing anything in terms of capital allocation strategy as a result of that greater caution like might you potentially pull back on development spend?","Robert Perlmutter","In terms of answering the last question, clearly over the last three years we\u2019ve tried to manage our portfolio and reduce our exposure to retailers that we felt were weaker. That happens more in the existing portfolio than in terms of new developments, which we obviously target the strongest retailers in the market for. In terms of where it impacts us, our position on many of the bankruptcies has been that as part of a restructuring you are investing in the retailer's business and we only want to invest in the retailers that we think have good long-term viability. And because of that we have probably taken a little bit more stringent stance on not restructuring with certain retailers who have gone through bankruptcy. The net impact for us is a short-term negative in terms of potential loss of occupancy. But we think a long-term positive in terms of being able to replace the stores with stronger retailers at higher rents.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just on Country Club Plaza. Can you talk about the importance of bringing in Taubman as a financial partner, what they bring to the table and why do they have leasing responsibility?","Art Coppola","Well, we are doing everything jointly. So from a merchandising viewpoint, Bobby and a couple of his key lieutenants and the person that runs leasing at Taubman, they have been collaborating and putting together a merchandising plan. And it is really going to be I think relationship driven. But as we sit down and we identify which tenants we think that we want to either move out or to move in, whichever team has the better relationship with that tenant will take the lead. But you should think of it as joint right on all major decisions and a whole bunch of operating decisions. We did have to decide who was going to be the manager and Taubman wanted to do the day-to-day management and we were fine with that. Our focus with them is going to be more thinking about the marketing, merchandising and potential expansion opportunities that are available at the property.","So why did we do it together? We just both thought that it was a great opportunity and we knew it was going to be a competitive situation in terms of bidding and there were many bidders. We felt that the opportunity to be successful in buying it would be maximized if we joined together to buy it. And so far I think that we both feel very good about this investment opportunity. And it may have been that doing it together is what resulted in the best thinking in terms of coming up with the confidence to pay the price that was required here.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Art Coppola","So we feel very good about the thesis and it is playing out, I believe, well. And we think that the Plaza has terrific upside. And I think time will tell, but I think you are going to see some very significant opportunities for us to generate value there.","Tom O'Hern","I'm going to jump in here for a second before the next question. In respect to Todd Thomas' question on the quarterly split of FFO, Todd, that\u2019s 20% in the first quarter, 23% in the second quarter, 26% in the third quarter and 31% in the fourth quarter.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question will come from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning.","Floris van Dijkum","A quick question, I noticed that you guys are \u2013 in terms of capital allocation you\u2019ve historically spent most of your money on your A malls. You\u2019ve now got three of your lower tier malls in the \u2013 potentially under development; Westside, South Park and Paradise Valley. Can you touch upon your \u2013 how you think about allocating capital and what kind of redevelopment plans that might entail?","Art Coppola","When we have something specific to \u2013 in the way of a plan, we will bring those forward. I think those have been in the supplement in that manner for at least the last couple of quarters if not more. But we have a number of different development plans for each of the ones that you mentioned. And fundamentally we think that they are sitting on very good real estate and that there will be opportunities. But that is why they are in the shadow pipeline, not the in-process pipeline, because we have not identified the exact plan we want to pursue or the numbers that would be associated with that plan. Does that answer your question?","Floris van Dijkum","Yes, it does. Can you maybe also touch upon your Sears joint venture and how many of your 10 Sears assets do you expect to start maybe this year? I know that none of those are in the development pipeline yet, but what do you think is feasible before year end and what kind of returns are you expecting?","Art Coppola","Well, actually two of them are going to be \u2013 have currently already had Sears downsize and turn over about half of each of the two buildings to Primark, one is at Freehold and one is at Danbury. And those both \u2013 so Sears has already shrunk and Primark will be opening in the summer. Those were deals that were in process when we first started the conversation with Sears, but those will happen this year yet.","And then the others, we are at different points of thinking through the opportunities. These were long-term investments that we made here. And we think that there is long-term that from the protection of the overall value of the properties owning the key pieces of land is tremendously important. But also we think that there are fundamental opportunities to be generated from each of them, some will be bigger, some will be smaller. And as we identify the opportunities we will talk about them. But we are not feeling any rush to say, okay, all 10 of them have been redeveloped or repositioned. We like the optionality that we have of being involved here. We are working together with Seritage to come up with the best plans that we can come up with. And as we come up with those plans then we will go ahead and move forward towards implementing them.","Floris van Dijkum","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And next we will take a question Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","George Hoglund","Yeah. Hi, this is George on for Tayo. Just wondering if you could comment on the trends in asking rents in terms of how are they trending on a year-over-year basis. I know you're seeing that leasing spreads have moderated a bit, but just looking at asking rents themselves.","Robert Perlmutter","Probably the best measure we can give you is the one I stated earlier that quoted the 15 leases versus the 14 executed leases. I think it was 5.4% increase. The setting of market rents is not \u2013 is more of an art than a science. There is many, many factors that go into it whether it\u2019s a new lease or renewal, what\u2019s the use, how big the space, how much frontage, what are the options that the tenant has in the market. So, it is not an exact science. And as we have talked a lot about in the past, we find that the dominant assets in the densely populated trade areas where the retailers have limited options always drive the highest rents.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks. And are you noticing any trends geographically?","Robert Perlmutter","As I said earlier, from a leasing standpoint the strongest rates and spreads were on the East Coast and the West Coast.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks. And any update you can provide on Fashion Outlets of San Francisco and the plans there?","Art Coppola","No, not yet. We're still working on it. And there is lots of infrastructure work that our partner is in the middle of performing. And as we get more specific in terms of the size and the returns available, we will obviously be more specific at that point in time.","George Hoglund","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions. We'll turn it back over to Art.","A - Art Coppola","Thank you very much for joining us. As you can see, we feel that we had a terrific year and we see our prospects for the future are very, very good. We are aware of broader economic conditions that could have an influence on those results, but fundamentally we feel very good about where we are. And we look forward to meeting with you further and answering any questions that you may have in the near-term. So thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation."],"13989":["Macerich Co.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Macerich Company Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","Again, this call is being recorded and I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma\u2019am.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone for joining us on our third quarter 2013 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","As this call will be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that the passage of time can render information stale, and you should not rely on the continued accuracy of this material.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the Company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bobby Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing; and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean. Today, we will be keeping our introductory comments brief to allow plenty of time for Q&A. That being said, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If run out of time and you are still in need of questions being answered, please do not hesitate to reach out for me, Art, John Perry or Jean Wood.","It was another great quarter. We continued to execute on our plan to dispose of non-core assets. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and we had a very strong operating performance during the quarter. Looking at our operating metrics, leasing volumes and spreads were both good. We signed 306,000 square feet of leases during the quarter with an average positive releasing spreads of 14.2% over the trailing 12-month period.","Mall occupancy was at 93.7%. That was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Also it\u2019s very important to note when looking at the year-over-year occupancy gain that over the past four quarters, we\u2019ve had about 250,000 square feet that had been converted from temporary tenant occupancy to permanent leases. The average rent differential between a permanent lease and a temporary lease is between $20 and $25 per square foot. Currently we have 5.6% of our occupancy which comes from tenants we consider temporary.","We will continue to focus on converting those tenants to permanent occupancy in the near future. In terms of FFO for the quarter it was up 10% at $0.86 per share compared to $0.78 a year ago, included in that was same-center NOI of 3.5% compared to the third quarter of last year. That increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing spreads and annual CPI increases.","Year-to-date same-center NOI was up 3.83% and our guidance for the year remains at 3.75% to 4.25% and just to remind you that\u2019s up a 100 basis points from our initial guidance for this year. Included in FFO for the quarter was a $1.4 million gain on early extinguishment of debt. The results of significant interest expense savings during the quarter as our average interest rate is down to 4.22% compared to 4.88% in the third quarter of last year. That\u2019s also evidenced by our 2.9 times interest coverage ratio for the quarter.","Our balance sheet we have again made significant progress our debt-to-market cap at the end of the quarter was 42% and our floating-rate debt has been reduced to 12.7%. That\u2019s about half of what it was year ago. Our average debt maturity duration has increased to six years, that\u2019s up from 4.2 years at September 30 of 2012.","We recently committed to a $268 million life insurance company financing on the currently unencumbered FlatIron Crossing mall. That\u2019s a seven year fixed-rate transaction with a rate of 3.85% that loan is expected to close in November and the loan proceeds will be used primarily to pay down floating-rate debt. So that will reduce our floating rate debt to under 10% of our total debt, and it will also stretch out our maturity schedule.","At September 30 the Company\u2019s debt to EBITDA was 7.75 times, that\u2019s down from 8.25 at the beginning of the year. We also have relatively light interest rate sensitivity if you look at the maturities coming up in 2014, 2015 and 2016. We\u2019ve only got a $119 million of debt maturing in 2014 at an average rate of 4.1%.","We\u2019ve got $640 million maturing in 2015 with a high coupon rate of 5.5% in 2016. We\u2019ve got $525 million maturing with an average interest rate of 5.8%, so we\u2019ve got lot of room from where we are today to those rates and we would expect that we would have very little, if any, negative impact from interest rate increases.","Also, as I mentioned after the FlatIron financing transaction, our floating rate debt will only represent about 8% of our total debt. In our press release this morning, we updated our FFO guidance. We increased the midpoint of our previously issued 2013 FFO per share diluted guidance range by $0.06, the new range is $3.46 to $3.52. The revised guidance range includes the actual dilutive impact of $0.18 per share relating to the disposition of seven non-core assets as well as selling $171 million worth of equity in May. Our initial guidance only called for range of $0.07 to $0.14 of dilution from those capital transactions.","The increase in the guidance results from the third quarter beat and the balance is primarily driven by strong operations that we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. On October 24 we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 6.9%, it\u2019s now $0.62 per share per quarter. This increased dividend represents a 4.2% annual dividend yield based on today\u2019s price.","Looking at tenant sales portfolio, mall tenant sales per square foot were up 7.4% to $549 a foot for the trailing 12 months compared to $511 for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2012. The impact of the assets that we sold on that number was $10 per foot, so the sales growth excluding the impact of those assets would have been approximately 5.4%.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thank you, Tom and welcome to our call. I would like to touch upon a few topics that have been very much talked about in the last couple of months with regard to regional mall landlords, and that relates to releasing spreads and moderating sales increases from tenants and its impact on same-center NOI. I also want to discuss a little bit the portfolio management activities that we have had including recently announced dispositions, our balance sheet and then finally our development pipeline and then open it up to questions.","It\u2019s clear that tenant sales have moderated over the past year, but releasing spreads today remain extremely strong. Tenants in our malls are making a lot of money. They are doing great sales productivity and there is extremely high demand. Laws of supply and demand work heavily in our favor, and if you look at the portfolio that we own, virtually all of the malls that we own are \u2013 at least 85% of the malls that we own are must-have malls.","So, when it comes time for a tenant to renew, it\u2019s not a matter of how much rent we\u2019re going to get, it\u2019s really a matter of just coming to the proper number and then moving forward. Many times we find tenants in centers like Queens Center where they are paying us already 40% some of sales and we tell them look it\u2019s probably time for you to move on, if you don\u2019t, your rents are going to have to go up to a certain number. They elect to stay, because when you are in must have trophy centers like Queen\u2019s, Tysons, Santa Monica and many others that we own. The tenants cannot afford to lose these spaces as part of their brand.","Anecdotally if you look back to the Great Depression of all of 2008 to the end of the third quarter of 2009. Tenant sales in our portfolio dropped 15% to 16% it was a disaster. But even in that environment because we were sitting on sales increases from 2004 through 2008 that had not been mined yet. We had releasing spreads of 14% in the year 2009.","If you look at our centers spreads are better or higher in our best centers. Our top 10 centers year-to-date had leasing spreads of a little over 30%. The next group of 20 centers have leasing spreads of just under 10% and the balance of the portfolio had leasing spreads of around 5% for an average of 14.2%, which all makes sense.","Regionally we had leasing spreads in Arizona of 12.5% year-to-date, in our central regions 7.8%, in the Eastern region 30% spreads, Northern California and Pacific Northwest 6% and Southern California 13%.","Our outlook for leasing remains extremely strong. If you look at our top 40 centers the sales in that group of centers averaged just over $606 a square foot and I\u2019ll remind you as you think about sales, that we\u2019re one of the only top tier Wall street companies that disclose sales on a center by center basis over the last five years.","So any confusion you may have about sales and productivity obviously can be answered by looking at that. 85% of our NOI comes from our top 40 centers, they average $606 a foot. Cost of occupancy in those centers is about 13.3%.It would not at all be out of the question if you would ask me how much embedded sales growth we have in those centers to tell you we easily have 20% mark-to-market in those centers, and that\u2019s without any future sales increases. So we remain extremely positive about our outlook on leasing spreads.","Moving to same-center NOI, I\u2019m very pleased to remind you that at the beginning of the year we gave you guidance that our same-center NOI would be in the range of 0.50% and 0.75% to 3.25%. We upgraded our guidance during the course of the year to 3.75% to 4.25%. Part of the thing that helped to drive that number is our efforts this year to put more focus on the conversion of temps to perms, and that certainly helped to drive our same-center NOI growth.","The guidance levels that we\u2019re at right now, 3.75% to 4.25%, those are very strong numbers. Very few sectors are able to put up those kind of numbers year-in and year-out, and again, we have a very, very bright outlook for the future here. Same-center NOI obviously is a function of many things. In our portfolio, a big piece of our same-center NOI is the fact that 70% of our leases are tied to a multiple of the cost of living increase. So we automatically every January get a bump of 1.5% to 2% depending on the inflation rate.","Leasing spreads obviously have an impact on same-center NOI and we\u2019ve been able to put up strong leasing spreads historically even in the toughest of times and we see strong spreads going forward. Probably the big number that would influence same-center NOI from one portfolio to another is occupancy, and I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that we are very stingy in terms of the rent that we get. We\u2019re very frugal in terms of the tenant allowances that we give and we demand high rents, and at times that means that we do not get rent increases as fast or we suffer turnover in our centers as we are replacing low productivity tenants with high productivity tenants.","I took a look at centers like Queens and Tysons and Broadway Plaza and North Bridge, and we don\u2019t include any of those centers in our redevelopment or development non same-center pipeline, and yet each of them are going through major releasing or are the subject of a major redevelopment that\u2019s going on. Queens has had substantial lease turnover.","And when you have frictional vacancy in a center like Queens and you are going from a tenant that is paying $1.5 million of rent to a new kind of tenant that\u2019s paying $3.5 million of rent, and that obviously has a big impact in your same-center NOI. If we\u2019re chasing same-center NOI, we wanted to take a short-term solution and not do the right thing for the real estate then we could put up better numbers in centers like that. But that\u2019s the wrong thing to do when you have those opportunities.","My guess is between those four centers and a couple of others of that nature that we do not exclude from our same-center NOI, even though we know at centers like Tysons where we\u2019re readying the center for the introduction of the new Plaza \u2013 Broadway Plaza where we\u2019re de-leasing the center in preparation for its demolition. North Bridge where we\u2019ve had substantial recycling, my guess is, is that our same-center NOI has been impacted by 50 basis points to 75 basis points just from holding space off or de-leasing space or frictional vacancy in centers of that nature.","Looking to portfolio management, I think that we are very happy with what we\u2019ve accomplished over the last year. It doesn\u2019t come without a price to earnings. Obviously at the beginning of the year as Tom mentioned we gave you guidance that we forecast $0.07 to $0.14 a share in dilution from disposition. In fact that number is going to be about $0.18 a share. So even though we currently are sitting on FFO growth for this year after all of that dilution of 11%, had we not elected to go through the culling that we went through and to reload our balance sheet for the future, we would\u2019ve had FFO growth this year of 17% to 18%.","As I think about the portfolio management that we\u2019ve accomplished I can look at it either one or two ways. I can look at it and say we essentially paid for the $1.7 billion of real estate that we bought in Kings Plaza, Green Acres, buying the 33% interest in Arrowhead and the 75% interest back in FlatIron in the fall of last year.","We either paid for that with our dispositions or we have essentially pre-funded our $1 billion development pipeline through our dispositions. Between dispositions, and the equity raise that we have this year we have delevered the company by a little over $1.1 billion.","During the quarter or at the end of the quarter there was an announcement that two centers are under contract with one of our peers and a couple of analysts have guessed that those two centers are Chesterfield and Salisbury. Those are pretty good guesses, and we would anticipate that, that transaction and the ordinary course of business after it flows through the rating agencies, because both of them have CMBS debt to close later on this year.","Looking to our balance sheet. It amazes me that investors over the last 18 months have forgotten 2008 and 2009 especially as we\u2019re moving into a period of tremendous financial uncertainty with government shutdowns and slowing retail sales. It gives me great comfort that when we said to you about two or three years ago that we were going to completely transform both the left side and the right side of our balance sheet that we have substantially strengthened our asset base, both through the addition of great new assets, the construction of great new assets, as well as some selective dispositions.","But we also have tremendously strengthened our balance sheet. Just this year alone we have delivered our Company by another $1 billion through our disposition and the equity raise. So, we are extremely pleased with where we find ourselves here. Tom took a look for you at our maturities over the next three years. Again, I would remind you, take a close look at how much we have lengthened our maturity schedule. Tremendous amount of our maturities are now in the 2020, 2021, 2022 and beyond, but even looking at the next three years, our pro rata \u2013 the debt that we have maturing over the next three years is about $1.6 billion.","Treasuries could go to at least 3.75%, maybe even 4%, and we\u2019re not going to go backwards in terms of the interest rate that we pay on that debt. Looking at those maturities, in a different way, our estimate is based upon current underwriting standards that those $1.6 billion of maturities could easily generate $800 million to $900 million of excess refinancing proceeds, which we would then use to go ahead and you could think of that as another source of self-funding our $1 billion development and redevelopment pipeline.","Speaking of which, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, obviously, opened up to a tremendous reception. Sales at the center are doing terrific. Traffic is outstanding. We are getting incredible reports from all of the retailers. Virtually every retailer talks about it being it\u2019s one of their best openings if not their best opening ever.","We\u2019ve had great contributors from tenants such as Coach and Gucci and Kors and Prada and Tory Burch and True Religion. Our anchorage, Forever 21, Bloomingdale, Saks\u2019s Off 5th, Neiman Marcus. Last Call, they are doing all terrific. We have great new tenants coming in the fourth quarter with Diane von Furstenberg, montelair, Trina Turk and Zegna and Burberry and metro coming in the spring of next year.","Based upon current sales estimates, we\u2019ve moved fashion outlets of Chicago in terms of our estimated sales rankings to just in the ballpark of our top 10. We\u2019ve actually got it ranked at number 11. You\u2019ll see in our supplement. We don\u2019t know what the sales are going to be obviously and we have sales results for two months, but two months cannot forecast what the first year or two is going to be. But I can tell you the traffic continues to be terrific.","The tourists are beginning to find us. We\u2019ve had over 50% of our foreign shoppers are from China, which makes sense, and we see tremendous upside from this center. We see opportunities for some nice surprises on percentage rents which actually is part of the reason for the breadth in range for the fourth quarter, because we won\u2019t know until we see those sales.","My current guesstimate is that if the sales levels that we would expect this center to be at, that we\u2019re currently sitting at a cost of occupancy at this center, even though we got strong rents going into it under 10%. So, as tenants rollover and in terrific centers you do have rollover, we find that in the great centers that when they open great the unproductive, tenants are exposed and great new tenants that see the opportunity are there to replace them with that kind of cost of occupancy that we see it\u2019s currently being under 10% at this center. We would see great opportunity for growth as we have an opportunity to continue to lease up the balance of the space as well as in the years to come to book percentage rents and the natural roll over that we\u2019ll have.","Moving to Tysons Corner that project will be coming online next year, it\u2019s on-time, on-budget the office leasing is up to just under 70%, we expect to open the office well over 90% committed.","As I mentioned the retail center is having tremendous benefits in terms of interest from tenants. We\u2019ve got flagship tenants that Bobby may allude to later that have committed to come and occupy retail space at Tyson but part of the price of making that space available it is the vacancy or frictional vacancy that you suffer to create that opportunity for them.","We had announced in previous calls that we see an all in going in cash on cash returns on the densification investment of something over 8%. And that doesn\u2019t include any uplift in the retail rents which we believe will be substantial over time.","In looking at our supplement Fashion Outlets of Niagara. We are now getting ready to break ground we\u2019re 70% leased, we\u2019ve got in our supplement $75 million of cost with a 9% incremental return. There is also substantial releasing of the existing mall at Fashion Outlets of Niagara that\u2019s taking place as we are moving tenants from the existing mall into the expansion mall and then backfilling with new tenants.","If I were to include the increment that we are going to pick up in the existing mall as part of the expansion which would not be an abnormal way of looking at it and then I would see an all-in return on this expansion investment of 15%.","Looking at North Bridge it\u2019s been announced in the press that Eataly as well as a couple of great new restaurants are going to be opening up in late November. We see that as being something that is going to drive tremendous traffic to the South Michigan corridor, which is anchored by the number one Nordstrom in the world at North Bridge Mall.","In our supplement you see a couple of new projects mentioned. We finally have gotten a wink and a nod that appears that we are going to able to get approvals to add a new movie theater to the 50,000 square feet of space that we\u2019ve been warehousing on the third level of Santa Monica Place that will generate tremendous traffic to the third level. There are no first class movie theaters West of the 405 or certainly in Santa Monica. This is going to drive at least 2,500 to 3,000 people a day.","Add to that the new metro link, the new Rapid Transit Rail System that opens up in two years across the street from Santa Monica Place, which will coincide with the new theater opening and the future there is very bright.","At Scottsdale Fashion Square, we\u2019re adding a new anchor complex, which is a combination of a major new theater as well as the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and we think that that\u2019s just the natural extension to a great regional mall of that nature.","The highlight of our redevelopment pipeline is Broadway Plaza. Just last week we finally got approval from the Core of Engineers for the vacation of an easement, which was necessary for the drainage easement that was necessary in order to enable us to move forward with the demolition of this center and building a brand new mall in this location.","If you think about what we\u2019re doing at Broadway Plaza, it\u2019s not that different than what we did at Santa Monica Place five years ago. At Santa Monica Place five years ago, we completely shut down the mall there. The only difference between what we are doing at Broadway Plaza and Santa Monica Place is that we\u2019re not shutting down the anchors and we\u2019re not shutting down the entire mall. But we are going to be tearing down about 175,000 square feet of space.","Currently one of the weaknesses of Broadway Plaza is that we just don\u2019t have enough specialty space for the retail tenant. We only have about 100,000 square feet of specialty space available for the retail tenant.","So, upon completion of this expansion which involves the demolition of all of the retail space between Nordstrom which is one of the top 10 Nordstroms in the United States and Macy\u2019s which is one of the top 20 Macy\u2019s in the United States. We\u2019ll be tearing down all of the specialty stores between those two department stores most likely next year.","My guess is that in the next supplement this project will move up to the green light category and then it will be opening up in phases and in late 2015 and early 2016 with the final phase being in 2017. We see an incremental investment of $250 million with an incremental return of 8% to 9%.","When we think about these incremental returns, we take the current net operating income that we have today and that we say, okay, we have to earn a return on investment that is in excess of that earned income. So, today we have let\u2019s say for example $15 million of NOI coming from Broadway Plaza, if we\u2019re going to spend $250 million on new investment and we hope to see at least an 8% incremental return, then we have to see at least a $20 million incremental return as well as replace the $15 million that was there in the beginning.","The center is going to be an unbelievable powerhouse, with a brand new mall. I would tell you it\u2019s the most exciting location to be built in the United States. Walnut Creek is one of the most sought after locations in the entire West Coast and it\u2019s certainly one of the three must have locations in the Bay Area.","Add to that a top Nordstrom, a brand new Neiman Marcus and a strong Macy\u2019s store and a proven track record for this center (which opened in 1951) for over 60 years, there is probably no other redevelopment or expansion opportunities like this. We are essentially building a brand new mall in the middle of an incredible trade area.","With that I\u2019d like to open it up to questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Arthur M. Coppola","Hi Craig.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi how are you? Art I was wondering if you could spend a little time and talk about how the redevelopment efforts at Kings Plaza and Green Acres are going to differ?","Arthur M. Coppola","Sure the initial development efforts at Green Acres currently we\u2019re primarily looking at building a series of tower center type tenants as well as entertainment type tenants on the 20 acres of land that we bought next door to Green Acres.","We\u2019re also doing a tremendous amount of leasing at Green Acres which maybe Bobby you may want to touch upon. And long-term obviously we\u2019ll be looking at the future of our department stores that are there, one of which would love to expand but obviously they need to get their act together before they can think of such a thing.","So right now tremendous amount of releasing is beginning to happen inside the mall at Green Acres and then we\u2019re looking at adding new retail space which we\u2019re getting tremendous rents from a lot of the bigger box type users on the 20 acres of land that we bought there. At Kings Bob would you like to comment on kind of what the merchandising plan is in focuses on Kings Plaza?","Robert Perlmutter","Sure Craig this is Bob Perlmutter. I would describe Kings as having two opportunities. The first one sits within the existing small store set. We believe we have the opportunity over the next couple of years to really make Kings much closer to Queens, in terms of physical improvements, in terms of merchandise mix, in terms of the way it\u2019s operated and marketed and ultimately in terms of sales. And as we\u2019ve discussed, if we can get the sales at Kings to a closer level to Queens, there will be significant rent growth over the coming years.","The longer term piece is the potential redevelopment of the Sears box which affords us approximately 300,000 feet of space that we believe over a longer period of time it maybe carved up into both specialty stores and restaurants as well as some box tenants. So there is opportunity within the existing mall stores and then there is the potential to redevelop one in the existing anchors.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just on Paradise Valley, I noticed that you\u2019ve taken away the projected cost. Are you thinking of enlarging that redevelopment or scaling it down?","Arthur M. Coppola","Scaling it down. There\u2019s uncertainty in terms of getting approvals from certain anchored apartment stores that have put a little bit more into a reconsideration category, which was a new development. So scaling it back.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Good morning. Tom, in your opening remarks you talked about temp to perm about 250,000 square feet over the last four quarters and currently about 560 basis points of temporary that I guess you would seek to eventually move over to permanent category that uplift of $20 to $25 of rent. So I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s the basis that you\u2019re using in terms of square footage? I think it\u2019s probably about 1 million square feet is that, but I wasn\u2019t sure in terms of that 560 basis points. How much of that do you think you\u2019re going to be able to convert the time to convert it and the capital that you need to put in to get the rents that you\u2019re looking for?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","Mike, I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then I\u2019ll defer it to Bobby. This is his team, is the team that\u2019s really got to do it. The 5.6% is roughly 1.3 million square feet in total. The capital, it\u2019s typically not a very capital intensive effort, at least to-date it has not been. So, the capital really isn\u2019t a significant part of the equation. Bobby, you want to comment on timing?","Robert Perlmutter","Yes In terms of timing, I think we see a long-term stabilized temporary occupancy of 3% to 4%. One of the things to remember is, when we are able to convert the temporary to permanent, it\u2019s not that we necessarily exit the temporary tenant out of the mall. We typically will maintain the temp in a lesser location. So, part of what\u2019s occurring is the temp is being converted to permanent.","A full rent is being achieved, yet the permanent \u2013 the temporary tenant is often relocated to another part of the center. So, we\u2019ll always have some degree of temporary tenants within the centers.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","So, I guess you are looking at total occupancy moving up in addition to the conversion. So, you sort of get a dual benefit from that?","Robert Perlmutter","Right. And I think roughly, we have over the last year about a 200 basis point increase in permanent occupancy.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. And then just on the disposition, I just want to make sure I get the change in sort of what you\u2019re doing. Including the two assets to Rausch, you\u2019ll have disposed of about $920 million gross of assets, is about $300 million of debt on those assets, so generating net equity of $622 million.","Originally, guidance was $500 million to $1 billion, about a third debt, so $650 million of proceeds, so sort of right smack in the middle from an equity perspective. So I am just curious how much of it was timing in terms of I guess now you are seeing $0.18 of dilution for the year and I guess how should we think about an annualized dilution impact from the sales activity.","How much was timing, how much was price just sort of what were the ins and outs relative to your original thought process on the sales?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","Michael one point of clarification on the $0.18, $0.05 of that dilution came from the equity issuance in May that was not part of our initial guidance. So $0.13 related to the dispositions that have happened year-to-date, obviously if anything happens between now and year end is going to have a pretty short period of time in 2013, so we wouldn\u2019t expect much impact there one way or another.","Arthur M. Coppola","As far as the timing of when that transaction materialized it was just the ordinary course of business. Look we are committed on an ongoing basis to pruning our portfolio and reinvesting proceeds from certain assets into our redevelopment pipeline and our top tier assets. That\u2019s going to be ongoing. In August when we had our last call we had nothing in the works there was nothing under contract. So this really developed after August, it is what it is.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Right, thank you.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi good morning guys. While we are on the disposition topic, do you have anything else I guess currently in the hopper as we look at 2014, I mean I realize you\u2019ll be opportunistic as these come along but is there anything you\u2019re sort of actively pushing or engaging at this point?","Arthur M. Coppola","Our policy on acquisitions and dispositions is generally not to comment on individual transactions. But I\u2019ll repeat that we\u2019re committed on a long-term basis to recycling our capital and to constantly through portfolio management, which \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the word I used for instead of dispositions today was portfolio management, through portfolio management to recycle out of certain what we consider to be non-core assets into our core assets to go for more assets to fewer bigger assets.","Look, I\u2019ll go back to the assets that we\u2019re selling. We didn\u2019t dislike any of them. We liked them all, but it made sense for us to prudently recycle our capital and this market is allowing, the transaction market is allowing that activity to take place.","So, I\u2019m sure that in our next call if there\u2019s anything, you\u2019re going to be in the works that would affect our 2014 guidance. We\u2019ll do what we did for you in the January guidance call of this year. But at this point in time what\u2019s under contract is that\u2019s been disclosed is it, but long-term, we\u2019re committed to culling our portfolio.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","In the appetite by buyers, is that changing in anyway? Would you say is it getting better or possibly worse I guess?","Arthur M. Coppola","I think that there are more buyers out there today than there were at the beginning of the year and I think the appetite of the specific buyer is higher today than it was at the beginning of the year.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay good thank you and then Tom, on the recovery ratio, it\u2019s staying \u2013 the expense recovery ratio, it\u2019s staying what seems to be unusually high but it stayed that way now for a couple of quarters. So I am just curious, is this unusual and we\u2019re going to head kind of back down a bit or should we keep the ratio up here?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","No. I think this is what you\u2019re going to see, Rich. I mean keep in mind that we have CPI increases built in not just for our minimum rents but also for fixed CAM charges. And oftentimes we have a better escalator on the CAM recoveries than we do on our minimum rents. In many cases it\u2019s 2 times CPI. So that\u2019s what helps charge the recovery rate and should help drive the gross margin as well.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay good. Thank you, guys.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thanks Rich.","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","Thanks.","Operator","And next we will go to Luke McCarthy with Deutsche Bank.","Luke McCarthy \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey guys just I guess quickly on getting it out of the way. If you could just comment on JCPenney and kind of what you guys are hearing from them post back-to-school season as we head into holiday sales?","Arthur M. Coppola","Look they seem to be generating more traffic. We have exits or intercept interviews with their store managers which thankfully I think is a better source of information than you might get corporately. And the store managers are pleased with the new management team and they are optimistic about the future, beyond that I am the last person in the world that could prognosticate the future there other than, we are long term supporters of JCPenney as a brand and long term I think JCPenney is here to stay.","Luke McCarthy \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sure, okay and then just one follow-up on redevelopment. There were some articles out there earlier in the year about you guys particularly responding well to your demographics I mean in California, in Phoenix with very culturally specific favorable attractions at the sites. Moving forward as you continue to focus on that effort, does that change from a cost perspective how you underwrite the deals or think about redevelopment moving forward?","Arthur M. Coppola","No, but it\u2019s an interesting question. Look the lessons that we\u2019ve learned in terms of focusing on our Vanguardia [ph] program. Is that you need to be in touch with your market whatever that market maybe. And that\u2019s the thing that drove us three years ago to come up with the crazy idea of tearing down Broadway Plaza at Walnut Creek. Walnut Creek is not a spare, but the lessons that we learned of being in touch with your community. Being in touch with your demographic and realizing what your demographic ones it\u2019s transferable across the board to all income groups and all ethnic groups. And Broadway Plaza as we looked at it we said look its great the anchors are great.","But there is so much demand for specialty space and the shoppers want so much more we are just not giving it to them basically we can\u2019t give it to them unless we tear down roughly 60% of the center and 70% of the parking deck and rebuild the whole thing. And it was insane frankly in some peoples minds for us to think about it but as we look at it today.","I think it\u2019s the best redevelopment opportunity to invest that kind of money to create a center that\u2019s going to be worth, could be worth $1 billion. It\u2019s an incredible opportunity and it\u2019s only as a result of really just paying attention to your trade area and not being satisfied with something that\u2019s good but we\u2019re even great but always wanting it to be at its highest investor utilization.","That\u2019s what drove us to do what we are doing at Walnut Creek that\u2019s what drove us to do the densification at Tysons Corner. It was paying attention to the metro rail coming. Again, that was not a cultural thing, but paying attention to your trader and always striving to take your real estate to the highest investors.","Luke McCarthy \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great, thanks guys.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thanks Luke.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Daniel Busch with Green Street Advisors.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","When I look at the different mall groupings in the supplemental package, it looks like there\u2019s quite a sizable gap between occupancy in the top 40 malls versus the ones outside the top 40, and I know Art, you mentioned that the retailer demand for space is quite strong. Is that demand, is it tend to drive pretty quickly, when you get outside of your top 40 malls? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of what the demand for space is at those lower productivity centers?","Arthur M. Coppola","I\u2019ll let Bob answer that, but our actual numbers year-to-date are that, we\u2019ve had pretty decent results in that group of 41 to 57. Bob, do you want to talk about it?","Robert Perlmutter","Yeah, I mean, I think the first point is, we have been able to generate positive leasing spreads, even in the lowest tier group. I think that the two differences are primarily the nature of your tenant changes a little bit, much of it is more local or regionalized tenant as opposed to a national tenant. We find that we\u2019re successful in maintaining tenants at renewals, but again, the nature of the tenancy is a little bit different and probably our biggest opportunities are less on leasing spreads and more on improving long-term occupancy.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Just one other question, just looking at the portfolio makeup, I know, obviously you\u2019ve been pretty active disposing of the assets, I guess, on the lower tier of the portfolio, but I know you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you want to focus on those markets where you have exposure or a great presence in and there are a couple of assets I guess where \u2013 I am thinking of you have one less than Texas that\u2019s above \u2013 in the top 40. Are those malls where you don\u2019t really have a presence in the market? Are those potential assets that you may look to dispose over the long-term?","Arthur M. Coppola","No, not that one in particular; look it\u2019s a national business and maybe I\u2019ve been a little too restraining when I said, look we want to focus on six or seven major markets. That\u2019s not to the exclusion of everything else. So we\u2019re not going to focus on only six or seven gateway cities. If a center is a must have center and we still see great upside in it, which the one in Bobby we do. Then it fits our profile.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, great. Thank you.","Arthur M. Coppola","We picked up that something down the road, possibly.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, thanks.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Arthur M. Coppola","Hello.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, a couple of quick questions for you. If I heard you right early on the call you said there is a 20% mark-to-market on your top 40 malls, even if sales stay flat. So I guess two questions, did I hear that right? And then could you provide the comparable number for your bottom tier malls?","Arthur M. Coppola","Yeah, you heard it right. That said, I did say that as I look at it that if you were \u2013 I\u2019m asked constantly what\u2019s your mark-to-market and I took a look at the top 40 centers we have, which generates 85% of our NOI. It\u2019s not hard for me to see at least 20% mark-to-market there and that\u2019s without pushing the envelope at all. That\u2019s really very easy to see.","The opportunity I think as we move below those centers, which are number 41 through 57, which are roughly 12% to 15% of our NOI. The real opportunity there, I think is more occupancy gain than it is rent spread, and there is opportunities to do that. So but look, what drives this ship here is the top 40 centers and those are the flagships that we own and where really we see the huge upside in. But I\u2019d say occupancy in the lower tier and rent uplift in the upper tier.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you for that. One more or I guess maybe one and half more. Just wanted to clarify the two malls sold week or so back, it sounds like they were not part of the broader disposition package contemplated earlier this year. Is that right?","Arthur M. Coppola","Which two are we talking about?","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That would Chesterfield and Salisbury?","Arthur M. Coppola","They were part of a group of properties that we had a broker exposing to the market earlier this year, they were\u2026","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess\u2026","Arthur M. Coppola","That by the way is not that relevant, because again I\u2019ll remind you that the fact that we gave a certain number of assets to the broker earlier this year to the intermediary. I had no estimation or contemplation that all 14 of those assets would be sold. We didn\u2019t want to speak for the buyers. We said look, these are some assets that fit the profile that we\u2019ve owned them a long time.","We have a low basis in them. We\u2019re able to do a reverse 1031 tax exchange to increase the basis in these assets to make it possible for us to think about selling them, and that\u2019s what we did. We didn\u2019t pull the market as to what people were interested in or what frankly we were interested in necessarily disposing it, other than the fact that they did fit the profile. They were not in our major markets. But they were part of a group of assets that were exposed earlier in the year.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. And in the fact of I guess Rouse. It\u2019s a fairly known Rouse, I think about those assets, in fact that they emerged as the winning bidder. Is there something there perhaps a lack of a private equity bid? We\u2019ve obviously seen them the private equity guys very active acquiring quite a few malls this year.","Is there something there that perhaps turned them off, maybe Rouse is perhaps the more strategic, a better buyer given perhaps operating of strategic synergies or some other factor? Just kind of curious as to with risk of putting words in the mouth of a public peer as to Rouse emerging as the winning bidder over the private equity who you would think could and should pay a higher price.","Arthur M. Coppola","I wouldn\u2019t want to do that. We\u2019re pleased to be able to transact with them. We are natural counter parties to each other and hopefully this is the first of several transactions that we can do with each other.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate it, thanks.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Hi, good morning Arthur.","Arthur M. Coppola","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","First question is, Tom, if we look in the packet, the majority of the unencumbered assets are in the lower tier malls, which as you guys where in the portfolio, presumably those are malls that get sold as you guys have been discussing. Along those lines, because of the balance sheet discipline, should we think about the malls in the upper buckets, those becoming unencumbered, so that you do retain that unencumbered pool or how should we think about that?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","No, I think we\u2019re clearly have moved in the direction of long-term non-recourse financing. Once we closed on FlatIron, Alexander, there will no corporate debt outstanding. We\u2019ve only got a little bit outstanding in line and in $125 million on secured term note. We will be completely secured borrowed at that point with $1.5 billion letter of credit available to us.","Then Art mentioned a little bit earlier, the maturities that we have coming due in 2014, 2015 and 2016, those are all for most part high quality assets that are unencumbered, I mean relatively lightly encumbered. And so we\u2019ll be able to put some additional financing on those above and beyond what\u2019s maturing. So we\u2019re in good shape and I would not expect to see us unencumbering a lot of assets in the top 30 or 40.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay. So previously where you guys had talked about your unencumbered asset pool that was more of a temporary nature, not something philosophical that the Company was seeking to maintain them?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","That\u2019s correct. I mean if you think about the period of time we\u2019ve been in the last three years or so, we\u2019ve been in a generation low of interest rates. And if you are going to be a non-recourse long-term fixed rate borrower, in the last 25 years, there has not been a better time to do so. And so we took advantage of the market conditions and we put some attractive financing on some of those previously unencumbered assets, the most recent of which will be FlatIron Crossings.","And you can look at the metrics on our balance sheet. Our floating rate debt is lower than it\u2019s been in many, many years. Our coverage ratios are better than they\u2019ve been, debt-to-EBITDA is rapidly approaching 7.5 times or lower and our maturity schedule has never looked as good as it has now. So that kind of speaks to the strategy in what we\u2019ve done.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay. It just seems then based on prior calls that you guys were looking to maintain an unencumbered pool, so just a little surprise that that was more just a reflection of a certain time period rather than a go-forward?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","If you look at that period of time you will also see we probably had significant amounts outstanding on our line of credit. We had some other corporate debt. So today we have virtually no corporate debt.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay.","Arthur M. Coppola","Without completely forecasting what we were doing, we also knew that the assets that were unencumbered were assets that potentially would be disposition candidates in the future. And we knew that certainly the private equity buyers are much more attracted to being able to put their own debt on these assets when they buy them, so that it makes them more saleable.","As of today, I think we also brought that up really just to point out our capacity, our firepower. It wasn\u2019t intended to be a signal that we were headed towards becoming a rated Company. We certainly have a balance sheet today directionally, but if we wanted to go that route over the next period of time, it could be done, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s necessarily the right thing.","To me the most important fact about our balance sheet today is that we have virtually nothing outstanding on $2 billion line of credit and we closed the upcoming FlatIron financing. We\u2019ve got substantial cash on the balance sheet. So we got a tremendous amount of capacity sitting here.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay. And then on Superstition, you guys bought out the rest of your stake there, there is about $350 a foot. What are your thoughts for that? I mean obviously you guys bought in the rest of the stakes, so what are your thoughts for that mall?","Arthur M. Coppola","It was just a transaction that was negotiated with our partner JCPenney and at this point in time, we like the asset. It\u2019s part of the group of assets there that we own. And we have actually had increases on the occupancy there, nothing in particular there shouldn\u2019t be any great signals.","It was done with a partner. If I had to really look at it and dissect what we did, it\u2019s not the type of property that we would buy, if we own nothing of it, but we already owned two-thirds of it buying the other one-third. When you\u2019re investing $20 million of equity to do it was not exactly a big stretch for our capital.","And as I think about it from a portfolio management viewpoint, it gives us the ability to maybe take some of our C Malls and dispose of them without having a significant dilution from those activities. So it\u2019s a little bit of a portfolio management decision.","There shouldn\u2019t be any big signal there, other than we\u2019re not buying $350 a foot centers on their own today. But going from 66% to 100%, it gives you complete control of the asset, which also gives us the ability to think about monetizing it in the future more easily, financing it in the future without having to talk to a partner. There\u2019s not a lot to be read into it though.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay. I didn\u2019t know if there was future expansion or something of that sort, but it sounds like not. Listen, thank you.","Arthur M. Coppola","Okay. Thanks Alex.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. On the temp to permanent occupancy discussion, just wondering if there\u2019s a way to characterize the space? Is it skewed to one anchor in the malls or is it just to spread out to characterize it generally?","Robert D. Perlmutter ","No, you shouldn\u2019t just view this as end zone or department store links. The spaces are really spread throughout the centers and spread throughout the quality of centers. Sometimes it\u2019s, because we\u2019re trying to accumulate blocks of space to bring in a larger retailer. Sometimes it is lesser locations. As the markets been improving, we\u2019ve been able to get permanent deals on it.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So lot of times it\u2019s your decision to hold this space right, the 50 yard line for a couple of years as you wait for better tenants?","Robert D. Perlmutter "," ","Sometimes; sometimes it\u2019s to fill timing that we need for these tenants. But the space is, as a general rule, you shouldn\u2019t just view them as lesser spaces within the centers.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then kind of tying that into the specialty leasing business, I\u2019m curious how you see that going forward? What is it as a percentage of revenue today and where was it a year ago, where do you think it could go and just your general thoughts on it?","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","In terms of this you have specialty tenant leasing?","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Yes, specialty leasing.","Thomas E. O\u2019Hern","Yes, today we\u2019re tracking an over $50 million a year. So it\u2019s a solid contributor to NOI, in NOI growth. It\u2019s a relatively mature category. When we first rolled this out we\u2019ve seen double-digit increases per year, it stabilized a little bit, but obviously as we move up the quality scale adding Kings Plaza and Green Acres that\u2019s going to help a little bit. For example, in the third quarter of last year, it was about $13 million, even this year it was about $13.9 million, so we\u2019re still seeing growth there and I don\u2019t see that changing. I don\u2019t know if you do.","Robert D. Perlmutter ","I would say one of the things we\u2019ve been trying to do in the common area is really not only grow the income, but improve the quality, especially at the top tier centers. And so that\u2019s been a big challenge of the mall teams and we\u2019re also looking at non-traditional ways to generate revenue within the shopping centers. So I would almost describe it as a maturing and evolving business within the shopping centers.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Yasmine Kamaruddin with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, it\u2019s actually, Mike Mueller.","Arthur M. Coppola","Hey, Mike.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, two questions. First of all, I think you mentioned for Broadway, there was about 15 million of NOI. How do you see that phasing out and over what time period? It\u2019s the first one.","Arthur M. Coppola","Well, I think that our budget, first of all that was by illustration, but that\u2019s certainly a pretty good ballpark. We\u2019ll diminish that by about 35% next year. So we\u2019ll take it down to a low point of $9 or $10 and then we\u2019ll grow it back up as we bring the space back on line. So they\u2019ll be at least $5 million or $6 million of NOI will disappear next year.","Look, it\u2019s a major project where you\u2019re demolishing almost half of the center. You\u2019ve taken well over half of the parking decks out of service and rebuilding them. There are a lot of people that would say that\u2019s crazy to do that, but the value creation opportunities are huge and our team knows how to do this, because we take old centers are reposition them, that\u2019s our expertise, that\u2019s our core competency. And yeah, to answer your questions, 5 million or 6 million of the NOI will go down and we do have a partner there. So we have half of that.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got it.","Arthur M. Coppola","And then we\u2019ll rebuild it to a level that could easily be in the 35 million to 40 million of NOI. I\u2019m not sure if I actually said it, but I mean I don\u2019t think Broadway is even in our top 20 centers in terms of NOI today. But when we get done with it, it\u2019ll probably be in our top 10, maybe even in our top five, who knows.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got it, okay. And the other question was just given the success at Chicago. Does it change at all how you are looking at incremental outlet developments?","Arthur M. Coppola","Well, it certainly gave us a lot of strength in the marketplace in leasing Fashion Outlets of Niagara\u2019s expansion. It made us really aggressive in terms of moving forward there on that. And beyond that, look it\u2019s a very interesting business that we see ourselves being a player in as we\u2019ve said before.","But again I\u2019ll repeat it, we\u2019re not going to own a lot of them, because we are going to have the same requirement for our outlet investments as we have for our full price investments, and that is that we want fewer, bigger, stronger assets. We want them to be dominant. We want them to be must have in their trade areas.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got it. Okay, thanks.","Arthur M. Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. So I\u2019d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional remarks.","Arthur M. Coppola","Again, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to seeing you in couple of weeks at NAREIT. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s call.

Welcome to The Macerich Company Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Hi. Thank you everyone for joining us on our second quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risks associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman of the Board; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with past practice, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please don't hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. It was another strong quarter we had very good operating performance. Looking at the leasing activity both volume and spreads were good. We signed 336,000 square feet of specialty tenant leases the average re-leasing spread on a trailing 12 months basis was a positive 18.1%.","The occupancy level rose to 95.4% that was up by 160 basis points over the portfolio average at June 30 of 2013 another strong gain for the quarter. Looking at occupancy on the same center basis the occupancy level was 95.4% compared to 94.8%, again a very healthy 60 basis point improvements there. In addition to the increased occupancy level overall we reduced our temporary occupancy down to 5.2% that compared to 6.1% at June 30 of 2013 it is also down from 5.8% reported at year end. It's an area we will continue to focus on converting temporary tenants to permanent occupancy and believe we can continue this trend. Average base rents are very close to $50 a foot, they increased to $49.14 a foot, that\u2019s up 5.5% from a year ago.","Looking now at operating results for the quarter, FFO was $0.86 per share that compared to $0.87 a share in the quarter ended June 30, 2013. This exceeded our guidance range of $0.81 to $0.83 per share.","In the quarter, we had same-center NOI of 3.6% compared to the second quarter of \u201813, which was also a strong quarter for us. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing spreads and annual CPI increases.","The gross margin for the quarter including JVs improved to 67.2%, up from 66.6% in second quarter of \u201813. Also keep in mind that the second quarter of \u201814 includes dilution from assets sales primarily assets sold in 2013 of about $0.05 per share.","Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2.5 million as compared to $2 million in the second quarter of last year. Over the past three years, we've averaged about a $1 million per quarter in bad debt expense. So this quarter was unusually high, most of it came from local tenants plus the impact of the Sbarro's bankruptcy.","During the quarter, we bought our partner out of a very small joint venture, it was a 50% interest in Cascade Mall and we bought them out for $15 million. This resulted in a recognizing the tax benefit for book purposes of $2.8 million during the quarter. This was largely in accommodation to our partner and this is a small non-core asset for us that we likely will consider selling in the future.","During the fourth quarter, the average interest rate was down slightly to 4.11% compared to 4.14% in the second quarter of last year. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape with debt to market cap at 39% and interest coverage ratio 3.2 times, debt to EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2 times and average debt maturity of 5.4 years with low amount of floating rate down, only 12% of our total debt is floating. In addition the financing market remains very strong. We have one financing in process right now. We've raised a $115 million refinancing of Victor Valley mall. The new debt is fixed for 10 years at a rate of 150 basis points over the 10 year treasury. So where rates are today, we expect to lock in a rate close to 4% and this will close.","In the press release this morning where we affirmed our FFO guidance of 2014 in the range of $3.50 to $3.60 we also confirmed our quarterly splits with 25% or so in the third quarter and the remainder 29% in the fourth quarter. There is a lot of moving pieces there, but we're still very comfortable with the range.","In terms of tenant sales, portfolio of mall tenant sales were up 4% to $567 for the year ended June 30, 2014 that compared to $545 for the portfolio during the period ended June 30, 2013. Taking a look at that stat on just the same center basis, sales per square foot $567 compared to $564 at June 30, 2013.","Further taking an additional look at it and including total sales that's for all tenants on same center basis which gives us the benefit of pick up in occupancy, this excludes anchor tenants but all other tenants. Our sales increased for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 was 4.5%.","Arizona and Northern California continue to be top regions for us in terms of sales growth. And before I turn it over to Art I\u2019d like to mention one last thing, we\u2019ve just completed the Macerich sustainability report it\u2019s on our website and there is a button on the front page of the website for it. We\u2019ve been very active in this area and this report does a good job of summarizing our effort, I encourage you to take a look at that.","Art Coppola","Okay. Thanks Tom. As you can see more our earnings release as well as Tom\u2019s comments our fundamentals remain fundamentally extremely strong. In fact, obviously our fundamentals are even stronger for us on a relative basis given the substantial pruning of our portfolio that we\u2019ve done over the last 18 months. One of the most relevant numbers I think that Tom pointed out was the total center sales essentially in terms of the properties that we own today versus the property those same properties one year ago that those are up over 4% in the last year. And to us that is at least as important of a number as the comp sales number that we also report to you which is limited by two factors, one it\u2019s tenants under 10,000 square feet and it\u2019s two we have a protocol that the tenants have been in place I think for the full 12 months in order to be counted. But total sales that are generated from the retail campus we look at that as being a very relevant number and when we see the business that\u2019s being generated from and it gets Tom's number was non-department store spaces that when we see that number going up it\u2019s a sign that our properties are extremely healthy.","To the extent that even on a comp center basis sales have been flat and have held their own, look we would clearly like to see sales be up 5% or 6% but the fact to the matter is the sales are relatively flat for reasons that are pretty much beyond our control that have to do somewhat with the weather but also had to do with broader economic issues, it's look back again, that only 47% of the people employed in the United States have full time jobs and there are over 24 million people in United States workers that have either left the job or are looking for jobs or in voluntarily part time employee.","But we still saw never had a recovery from 2009, we still continue to model through, we say I believe is that changes overtime. But the fact that sales have been flat in our portfolio as well as others is long to maintaining sales that highly productive level of $580 a foot give or take and as long do you have must have real-estate and as long as the tenants really have no choice within your submarket or that you have the best choice within your submarket for them to take locations.","Then the demand for your space remains very strong and given, again the reality of no new supply in terms of comparable space, in terms of shopping mall space in United States that continues to drive our releasing spreads, which we have demonstrated through charts that we have shared with you and also just through looking at the quarterly results that we've given the double-digit in the releasing spreads over the last 10 years in good times and bad and we see that continuing for the foreseeable future.","We are very pleased in terms of where we expand from a portfolio view point or very pleased that have our dispositions largely behind us, we're pretty much out of the disposition business. From a guidance view point, we'll maintain our guidance to you that we will sell give or take on a net basis $250 million of assets for the year, we've sold the modest amount that's been sold to date we don't currency have anything under contract, we are talking on an opportunistic basis about one or two assets with the one or two groups we will see where that goes for and leaves the guidance untouched, net 250 million of dispositions waiting towards the fourth quarter of this year, but what we are very pleased about is to have completed our disposition program and to have that 1.5 billion that give or take in proceeds available to us to redeploy into our proven winters. And we are finally reaping the harvest. Tysons Corner is entering into a three day celebration today of the opening of our plaza at Tysons Corner with a big concert series starting tomorrow. We are celebrating the occupancy of the office building by Intelsat and we are celebrating the first writer of the silver line of riding at Tysons Corner at the Tysons substation on Saturday at 12 noon.","So that\u2019s huge to see that finally happen. We are very much looking forward to continue on our progress on Broadway Plaza. In our supplement we decided to give you some rendering and also some photographs of before and after rendering of Broadway Plaza for example to give you a better idea of what we are doing there. So maybe after the call you can take note on page 36 of our supplement you will see a photograph of the center as it existed in April of this year, that area between Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom on that photograph has now been demolished which you will see on page 37 and then you will see a rendering there on those pages also of where the new shops are going to be and that\u2019s a very powerful expansion of a very powerful location of that we are very much looking forward to building out and opening up and phasing again starting next year.","Our Niagara project remains on time and on budget and we are also as we mentioned in the last call doing fairly significant add-ons to proven winners at Cerritos, Scottsdale Fashion Square in Santa Monica Place. Then you will see one project has dropped off of our supplement this quarter, which is the Estrella Falls in the West Valley and Phoenix and we dropped it off of the this supplement just because we like to have only on the supplement project that we think that may happen in the next three years. And currently we just don't see that for that new mall as something that we're going to want to deliver in the next three years. We think it's something that will happen over the next five years or seven years, it\u2019s just not going to be in the next three years.","Phoenix has had a nice strong run in 2012 and through the middle of 2013 and continued to have decent employment growth. But the housing demand for new housing units has begun to flatten out a little bit. So, we're going to be a little bit cautious there, we own the land for not a huge investment and we'll be very judicious in terms of when we bring that new products online, there is no rush to bring it online, we're bringing online when it's ready to be brought.","In terms of other possibilities of projects that may find them their way other supplement, outside of our existing portfolio, we continue to work very selectively on some dominant high building entry urban locations for outlet centers and not fairly confident in the near future we will be able to announce the addition of one or two of those projects to our pipeline of opportunities.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions and operator if you could take over from here, appreciated.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question from Christy McElroy of Citibank.","Christy McElroy - Citibank","Hi good afternoon everyone.","Art Coppola","Hi Christy.","Christy McElroy - Citibank","When you guys reported results in, Q4 results in February your guidance at that point was $3.50 to $3.60 and I think that included $0.08 of dilution from $225 million to $275 million of sales that you had expected in the year. You feel $34 million at this point, it sounds like you still expect somewhere in that $250 million range but weighted towards the back end of the year.","I am wondering how much of dilution is embedded in that $3.50 to $3.60 today and what sort of offsetting that from a positive standpoint -- or from a negative standpoint, I am sorry?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well Christy a large part of the dilution were assets that we sold last year sold far more last year than our guidance for this year, and most of that was mid year and so rolling through. So first quarter for example had about $0.06 second quarter $0.05 and then it tapers down to about $0.03 or $0.04 a quarter in the last two. There is a lot of things in that guidance range, things like we certainly hadn't predicted the additional energy costs of the harsh winter I would cut the other way.","We've got two numbers that are, frankly their estimates based on history and that's bad debt expense and that's lease termination revenues. And obviously second quarter as I mentioned was active in terms of bad debt expense and wider than normal.","On the other hand we could see more leasing termination revenues coming in as a result of some things were in the mid stuff. So we're still very comfortable in that range, there is a lot of pieces do dilution, so one of it, yes there is little less dilution because of timing than we thought, but again vast majority of the dilution because of timing than we thought but again the vast majority of the dilution we had factored into the 2014 guidance was as a result of the 2013 dispositions, not the 2014.","Christy McElroy - Citibank","Okay. And just quickly what was the cap rate on the buy-in of Cascade?","Tom O\u2019Hern","We generally don\u2019t get into the cap rate conversation but I can say it was double-digit.","Christy McElroy - Citibank","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good afternoon.","Art Coppola","Good afternoon.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey, just a question here on NOI. You guys have been speaking about converting the temp to perm and how that would boost NOI and just general, getting the work in the portfolio. And I wonder you guys have talked about being north of 4%, so just sort of curious, I think you\u2019re about 3.5% sort of year-to-date what are the things that are going to get the portfolio up into the north of 4% range?","Tom O\u2019Hern","So our guidance range was 3.75% to 4.25%. And obviously there is things that are hard to predict along the way but we typically see more momentum in the second half of the year. Obviously the leasing and the occupancy pick-up that happened in the second quarter doesn\u2019t really benefit us until in the third and fourth quarters. So we certainly expect to see that the conversion of temp to perm, most of that benefit is going to be in the third and fourth quarter. So we see all those things. And at this point, we see no reason to change that guidance range of 3.75% to 4.25%, was artificially low in the first quarter because of some of the expenses I mentioned on that call. Also keep in mind we had a big quarter in the second quarter last year. So we\u2019re comping against the quarter that was up 4.6%. At this point we\u2019re not going to change the range.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And Tom, just obviously you're not giving \u201815 guidance, but sort of on a run rate basis after we get through the changes in the portfolio this year, should we expect a 4% plus type as a good run rate?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, I think over time, I mean again from our standpoint a big factor in same center growth is going to be CPI index, because that's how we -- increases our leases every year. Mostly two times CPI formula, not to exceed a certain number in this year and particularly we had a relatively low CPI. The CPI; had gone up 1.1%, we had a 2, in most cases two times the factor on that, typically in the past was too much higher inflation rate than1.1%.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","So that's how it affects us but based on the way it's trending this year, it looks like CPI on a trailing 12 month basis, I think is running about 2.1%. And of course we have two times escalator, so we should be buying in fact in better shape next year.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Cascade Mall aside, is there any interest in buying out some of your JV partner share, particularly at some of your larger more dominant malls?","Art Coppola","Yes. But they're not sellers that we're happy to -- we\u2019re thrilled with them as partners. So that's not an opportunity at this point in time.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from DJ Busch of Green Street Advisors.","DJ Busch - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Street retail seems to be a property type and focus right now we\u2019re seeing some REITs acquire some properties recently. It seems like that will be the natural owner of street retail, could be mall owners given the overlap in Tennessee. When we think about you guys strategy of owning the dense urban centers, seems like controlling some of these street retail corridors outside of your better malls and I am particularly thinking of North Bridge, Santa Monica place. It seems like that would be a natural progression of solidifying or fortifying your position. How do you guys think about some street retail opportunity in addition to some of the things you\u2019ve already done in Chicago?","Art Coppola","I will start and maybe Bobby Perlmutter will also chime in on this. But first of all, you may have noticed, I certainly noted yesterday walking the streets of Chicago that the street retail resurgence and merchandising that we have accomplished on Ohio and Grand and Rush has been really remarkable here at North Bridge, we are actually in Chicago today conducting this call, It\u2019s been unbelievable. Eataly was a huge addition, we added some great restaurants and it\u2019s just a real reactivation of the street. And of course we also popped a new entrance up into the mall off of Rush and Ohio up into the mall and we are also beginning to re-merchandise some of the frontage that we have on Michigan Avenue. So yes I mean that\u2019s an -- when we bought North Bridge mall, it had a great amount of street retail and so we have done a great job of re-merchandising a lot of that and creating active bid in store fronts where we used to have office users, health club users and ESPN zone things like that. And we have done really well with that.","Santa Monica yes, it\u2019s a logical extension of Santa Monica place to think about, some surrounding real estate in that vein we were very happy as part of getting our entitlement to add a theater to the third level of the Bloomingdale's building at Santa Monica place. We entered into a excluding negotiating agreement with the city of Santa Monica to entering the long term lease of a parcel of land at Arizona which is one block away from Bloomingdale's in Santa Monica. And there is currently an obsolete parking garage there, we would tear down the parking garage and we would add a second theater location, so we would basically control all of the first run theaters in Santa Monica as well as some incremental retail on the ground floor which would be street retail. You pick the two cities correctly that are the logical ones that we might consider it.","Having said all that, I would be pretty reluctant to enter into the acquisition of street retail in markets where the retail is not absolutely contiguous or adjacent to an existing regional center, because it is really a business for sharp shooters and not the tenant.","There is a lot of profits, but when you are buying assets at two cap rates, you better be pretty certain about remerchandising plan over a long period of time.","I feel better about kind of what we're doing, when we're, we bought the street retail as part of the acquisition of North Bridge and we made a lot of money on the roll over of the various leases and we've really increase the productivity here in Chicago.","And I feel really good about the opportunity that we've got, that we're working on it Santa Monica, because it's a proven winning neighborhood for us. It supplements our mall in terms of the use, because when the co-branding the ArcLight that we would put 4th in Arizona with the ArcLight is going in the Santa Monica Place will drive the traffic back and forward between the two properties, so it's synergistic.","And we fully expect to see a high single-digit return on our investment on that street retail investment that we're looking at 4th of Arizona which probably, it could range from anywhere from $30 million to $75 million, our investment there depending on whether we just do it either $30 million to $75 million our investment there depending on whether we just do a theater or we also do a little bit of street retail as part of it. Bob you want to add to that a little bit?","Robert Perlmutter","The only items I would add is the other center that we own that could fit into those characteristics is Walnut Creek Broadway Plaza and Walnut Creek which has a very developed street district. Cleary there is retailer demand and in particular there is certain retailers that prefer the street and often prefer the street around a larger shopping center or a shopping district.","So there is different tenant demand but as Art said it's not inexpensive real-estate to purchase and it's a very fragmented ownership.","DJ Busch - Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Art Coppola","Good afternoon Rich.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Guys good afternoon. The big drop this quarter in operating expense I mean I realized there was obviously some change from the first quarter in terms of snow and weather kind of thing but was the big drop in the second quarter strictly that or is there something in else in that operating expense number that's better than usual?","Art Coppola","Rich there was also some dispositions in the first quarter full effect discussed in the second quarter they were small assets but nonetheless they had some of those operating ones.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So going forward then Tom this is a pretty good run rate or pretty good starting point?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes I would say this is a good run rate discussed the factors that are acquisition distribution activity.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great thanks guys.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Obviously things like utility expense were much higher in the first quarter because of the severity in winter.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Right I got you good yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Morgan of MLV.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Hi, good afternoon. Just on the outlet the comments you've made about new developments and also you are about anniversary Chicago and maybe just do you have any thoughts or I mean takeaways from the first year there? And we just separate it looks like it might come in around $700 a foot. How is that relative to where your performance is occupancy just a bit and where is the sweet spot of retail demand and as you think about other urban centers Chicago a template in terms of where you market in terms of the upscale versus mass market?","Art Coppola","I mean so you\u2019re interpolating our expectation of the sales per foot at $700 give or take that first year that\u2019s about right. And we don\u2019t have all 12 months, so when we have them we\u2019ll publish that number or at least talk about it. That exceeds the expectations of that most had, it\u2019s pretty much in the mid point of the market research that we\u2019ve done in terms of estimating it. To built that outlet center on 500 and some thousand square feet and have it produce $700 a square foot in the first year is pretty amazing. It\u2019s very rare, any center would start with that kind of number and so it\u2019s a really impressive number especially given the skepticism that many had about the by viability of Fashion Outlets of Chicago outside of Macerich.","We -- it validates our belief in high barrier to entry infill urban markets for a very, very select number of these types of development. I don\u2019t think there is more than a handful of this available to us in the United States but I do think there is a handful available and I think there is one or two hopefully that we\u2019ll be able to talk about in a relatively near future. The productivity that we\u2019re achieving at Chicago again is really unusual and yet it also represents the target base case that we\u2019re shooting for when we think about other opportunities.","Paul Morgan - MLV","And so you're comfortable that the retailers based on the experience here or kind of rate to go up against other full price malls and major markets at where the location is?","Art Coppola","The retailers that are here universally are asking us okay now where else can we do this.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Mueller of JP Morgan.","Art Coppola","Hi Mike.","Michael Mueller - JP Morgan","Yes, hi. I was wondering, do you see any activity at Atlas Park anytime soon and just going particularly with outlets could that be one of the areas that you're talking out for urban outlets?","Robert Perlmutter","Sure, this is Bob Perlmutter, Michael. Atlas Park has had a pretty good amount of activity, some of the key tenants and we've added included Forever 21, recently Ulta opened and TJ Maxx is under construction. So we're making a lot of progress have done some physical improvements to the green area and we're building some really good momentum from a leasing point.","Art Coppola","And no we're not thinking outlet there. We did think about a year and a half ago, but it doesn't work.","Michael Mueller - JP Morgan","Got it. Okay. That was it. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the guidance again real quick, just thinking about the quarterly number was ahead of your expectation or at least your guidance there and then you talked about some a little bit less dilution from some of the asset sales. So I was just curious beyond the income tax benefit that you booked in the quarter. Was there any else that\u2019s sort of one-time in nature here in the quarter that boosted the result and maybe comes off the run rates going forward?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Now that was about it and that was roughly $0.02 a share that benefit.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","The rest of it, it gets pretty close to where our guidance was if you take that out certainly it was pretty much around top where the street was.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. I guess it does seem to imply a little bit higher level than the guidance would suggest so it\u2019s kind of what I am trying get at a little bit more.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well as art already indicated we are still expecting to finish off the year with some dispositions to get to that $250 million number. So the dilution from those would back end weighted.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hey good afternoon.","Art Coppola","Good afternoon.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Hey Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","So your comments earlier on the remaining contemplated mall sales of $250 millionish, sounded like you could be comfortable holding on to the assets for some time. Is that a function of the pricing demand for the assets or is there perhaps something within that comment that we are not fully appreciating?","Art Coppola","The major message you should take away from it is that we are formally out of the disposition business and we are done. That doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to continue as we have in years passed to opportunistically sell assets on a one-off basis and this year our guestimate in terms of giving guidance is that we would have $250 million of net dispositions which remains our guesstimate for the year, but there is nothing more to read into it.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then more if I may your comment on bad debt expense being unusually high this quarter due to some borrowers and local retailers, looking ahead where do you think expect that bad debt expense to be near-term going forward and do you expect it to remain elevated near-term as a result of local retailers?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think we can extrapolate from this quarter it was a relatively unusual quarter. Obviously we have had some bankruptcies this year, Sbarro and more recently we had few small ones Hot Dog on a Stick, Love Culture, but they don't take a lot of space, nor do they pay a lot of rent. So we may see some of that ripple through. But it's hard to predict that one that lease terminations are the two hardest to predict. But I think it will be less than $2.5 million, but we could be more than the $1 million that we've been running the last 3 or 4 years on average per quarter.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Just following up on dispositions a bit. Last quarter Art, you seemed to make some comments around the environment, saying it was little bit better than expected and you commented that cap rates on the sales will be closer to 8% versus 9%. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re still seeing today and maybe could just comment on sort of the market and the buyer pull today?","Art Coppola","I'm not the best person to ask anymore, because we are officially out of the disposition business. However, I can make an observation as an interested bystander. I thought the pool was getting bigger, I now am not sure. In terms of any dispositions that we would do throughout the balance of the year, my guess is that they would tend to be on average in the 8%, maybe 7.5% type of cap rate. But given that no properties are under contract at this point in time, that's so speculative.","It seems that the buying pools a little more confident, way more confident than it was a year ago. 3 months ago, I may have gotten a little ahead of myself in terms of guessing about the growing size of the buying pool. But again, since we're really not in the disposition business right now. We're really just a one-off opportunistic seller, if something is attractive to us, I\u2018m probably not the best person to ask.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, that's fair. And then just one other question, curious about the comments around Cascade Mall. Tom, I think you characterized it as an accommodation for your partner. I was just curious what that means and whether you can elaborate on the go forward strategy with that center since it seemed like that that's not a core holding for Macerich long-term?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Todd, you are right, it's not a core holding, it's a very, very small asset, I mean our price to purchase that it was unencumbered with $15 million, so not a significant transaction. Our partner was motivated to move out of that particular asset. And frankly we felt it was an asset if owned a 100% of gave us more flexibility to perhaps package with other assets in the future and part of a group of assets that were sold.","So nothing more than that. Small transaction, and it's with the good partner and partner that we have other assets with and we're happy to accommodate them.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan of Cowen & Company.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen & Company","Thank you, good afternoon guys. Art, I've got a quick question for you regarding the direction of occupancy cost. Obviously you\u2019ve got a couple of cross currents in the portfolio here as a result of all the asset sales the average productivity is moving higher. And I guess it's kind of axiomatic or we tend to believe that higher the productivity, the higher the occupancy cost you can generally get. May be that's true, may be that isn\u2019t.","On the other hand, the outlet center business historically has been a sector where the occupancy cost as percentage of sales has been a little bit lower. So help us understand where you think that's going to go as you continue to improve your winners as you described them and at the same time look to continue to grow your outlet center business?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well Jim, we\u2019re still on a relatively low level, if you take the unconsolidated and consolidated, I think our blended rate is 13.5%. And you\u2019re absolutely correct that percentage can be much higher, the higher of the quality the assets are. And we think given the fact we\u2019ve disposed slower growing assets, we\u2019ve got lot more leasing momentum. And I think the evidence of that is what we\u2019re seeing our re-leasing spreads as well as our occupancy pick-up and we think we can continue to push that. And you know as well as anybody that that number moves very, very slowly; the only time moves quickly it moves was on the direction when sales plum it. But when you\u2019re re-leasing space and get your hands on maybe 8% to 10% of that space, it takes a lot of to push that number up but we think there is a lot of upside and room in that occupancy cost number.","Art Coppola","This is a terrible generalization, so please don\u2019t hang me on it. But if our overall occupancy cost as a percentage of sales is in the 13% neighborhood?","Art Coppola","13.5%.","Art Coppola","13.5% and our total sales per foot is in the high $500s. What I would suggest to you is that 13% on a $500 foot center maybe it feels about right overall and you have 20% on a $1,000 foot center feels about right overall. And you can kind of do a straight line bar chart along the way and find yourself getting comfortable at 15% and 16% cost of occupancies for centers that are doing $700 and $800 a foot and again those are terrible generalizations, but I certainly don\u2019t want to be hung to drive with them. But if I have to answer your question, it\u2019s very clear to us that these centers that we own that do a $1,000 a foot and we\u2019ve got several of them in that zip code right now or headed the way. The tenants can up for to pay you very high double-digit 18%, 19%, 20% cost of occupancy we\u2019ve run Queens Center at 20% cost of occupancy from the day we owned it and we did that when the center was doing $600 a foot and we're doing it, we're leasing space today at times at 30% of the $1,000 a foot average. We're leasing space at Queen center $300 plus rents on some deals and you have to center average is a $1,000 a foot.","Going to the outlet side, I'm not the best person to ask about that obviously there are others that have a lot more experience in this arena, but we do have some experience that at Fashion Outlets in Chicago where we've had some spaces come back to us which is very normal in a brand new development for the winners to emerge and those they don't belong there also define they don't belong there for early on. And we've had tenants where we merchandised space already where we're getting rents over a $100 square foot for a center that averages about the $700 a foot so far run rate today, which would imply 15% cost of occupancy on today's average sales put at that center, which again makes sense to me that you can charge those kinds of rents.","So it's clear that the higher the sales per foot especially is to get over $500 a foot that the tenants basic cost of goods business once it's covered, the incremental cost of doing business allows them to pay a higher rent charge and still make money.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen & Company","So should we assume $700 per foot urban outlet center would justify a comparable occupancy costs to a $700 per foot regional mall?","Art Coppola","I doubt it.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen & Company","A little bit lower?","Art Coppola","I\u2019m the one that has said to you, even though we have an anecdotal experience that we've seen that happened we are not experts in this arena we only have a couple of data sources to measure against but we are not bashful in terms of asking for those kinds of rents and so far we have gotten them but the pundits would tell you that there is a little difference and I suppose there is but once it\u2019s a proven winner especially a $700 a foot center I am not sure there is that much difference between old price and our price.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen & Company","Okay guys, thanks.","Art Coppola","Bob Perlmutter may want to add to that.","Robert Perlmutter","And this is Bob Perlmutter the only thing that I would add is I would tend to agree with Art in terms of it may not be exactly the same but clearly the spread is going to narrow especially for as we believe there is a distinction between the real premium must have outlet locations and the more traditional outlet locations.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen & Company","Okay, very good thanks guys.","Art Coppola","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ben Yang of Evercore.","Ben Yang","Hi, good afternoon thanks. Art I understand you recently hired some executives from AWE Talisman recently so just curious if you can talk about their roles at Macerich and if the plan is to eventually build an in-house outlet theme so that you can do these projects solo going forward?","Art Coppola","Okay, so we have internalized the leasing function by adding two senior leasing people to our staff in the last couple of months. We have also internalized the marketing function by adding a very senior national marketing person to our staff and marketing in the outlet world has important at times at least as important as the leasing, so that\u2019s a very important job and we have taken over the day to day management of Fashion Outlets of Chicago and Fashion Outlets of Niagara. So as of today we are vertically integrated in all function in the outlet world.","Ben Yang","I mean given obviously you are hiring people for this particular platform you mentioned one or two new projects I guess than you might announce in the near-term I mean is there any vision or goal in terms of how big the outlet platform will be I don\u2019t know maybe two or three years now?","Art Coppola","I would say that in five years from now, we'll have five really good outlet malls and today we have two, but that that would be a really good days work.","Ben Yang","Great. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Linda Tsai of Barclays.","Linda Tsai - Barclays","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","Art Coppola","Hi.","Linda Tsai - Barclays","With respect to the five groups within your property rankings. How do you think about the opportunity to become more productive? For example how much more productive can group one or two be versus say group four and five?","Art Coppola","Philosophically, I would tell you that group one and two can always be more. The better center is the better you can make it. The idea that you kind of top out just is not true.","Because even within these centers, what you have to do is dig within the numbers. And I talked about this in a previous call and I don't have the numbers exactly handy to me right this second. But of the top ten centers, the average $860 square foot in our portfolio. Within those 10 centers, the top two-thirds of the tenants within each category average around $1,150 or $1,200 square foot. And the bottom 33% of each category at those centers averages and I have talked about in the previous call, but I think its $400 a foot give or take.","And so there is a huge opportunity to take and essentially take the underperformers within these highly productive centers and to recapture those spaces and to re-let them at higher rents. So, we talked about a bankruptcy situation earlier with Love Culture. We have 88,000 square feet with Love Culture today. They have some really good centers with us and we have 10 stores with them. They average of $188 square foot in those 10 scores. They pay us mid $50 rents in those 10 stores. The centers that they happen to be in are all in our top 20 and those centers average $585 a square foot. And the average rents that are in place for those 10 Love Culture locations are around $92 a square foot for the centers in question. There is a big opportunity there over time to re-merchandise that space at a substantial profit.","Just intuitively when we look at the bottom 10 assets that we own, there is a reason that they are doing $300 a square foot and a lot of times just because they are in secondary or tertiary market. And the opportunity to make a center like that to grow it dramatically is just not the same as it is to take a great center and make it greater or really good center and make it great.","And that's why we did all of the pruning that we did. And we're taking all that money that $1.5 billion ploughing it into our best centers because those are the most elastic in terms of the upside.","Linda Tsai - Barclays","Thanks. And then I just had a follow-up. Tom, I think you made a comment earlier about tenant reimbursements and there are being some moving parts. Are you expecting tenant reimbursements to increase over the next couple of quarters?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No, it wasn't tenant reimbursements, it was lease termination payments.","Linda Tsai - Barclays","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","We expect we are having conversations today that could lead to accelerating some of those rents. So that's always an estimate. And I think our guidance initially had $8 million or so estimated for that this year. And we could see more that activity accelerating in the third and fourth quarter.","Linda Tsai - Barclays","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Art Coppola","Hi Tayo.","Operator","And Tayo has disconnected. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim from Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.",".","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.","Thanks. Just an accounting follow-up, is there any drag from redevelopment activities on same-center NOI, the 6% that you reported this quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I am sorry, the same-center NOI, is there any redevelopment drag?","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.","Yes.","Tom O\u2019Hern","There is a little bit, the major redevelopment properties are not in there, Broadway Plaza is not in there for example, Fashion Outlets in Niagara is not in the number, Fashion Outlets in Chicago is not, it hasn\u2019t been around for a full year. And so, there may be a little frictional vacancy at Tysons for example that\u2019s hitting that number that should reverse itself actually in the next quarter or two. And then, Bobby?","Robert Perlmutter","No there is just some major remerchandising projects going on at Queens and Kings as part of the 10 year cycle.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.","Okay. And then kind of related to that, as your projects come on line over the next 12 months or so, how do you guys categorize these activities or these projects in your -- within your same-center NOI definition?","Tom O\u2019Hern","They\u2019ve got to be in \u2013 they have be completed and in for the full period, full quarter, in this case before they\u2019re included. So for example, a project that finishes Fashion Outlets in Niagara, if it\u2019s finished and leased up in the fourth quarter of \u201814, it would not become a comp center until the first quarter of 2016.","Art Coppola","But the money you make incrementally improving and existing center if there is major capital involved is not same-center NOI that they return on that investment. Correct.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Correct, okay. Just that\u2019s what so we're talking about. I mean if you are adding space its not included.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Nussbaum of UBS Financial.","Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS","Hey good morning, I am Jeremy on with Ross. Just one, quick one sorry if I missed this. Can you talk about the increasing costs at your Niagara development it seems like they were up a little over 10% no change of yields, so this just some extra build out that tenants will compensate in the rents?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No, it\u2019s a combination of things addition, we're actually achieving better than budget rents, we expanded the scope of the project a little bit to include some renovation to existing center and there is some shifting in the TI. But this some minor additions and improvements and that is strong budget and we had the room to do it so we expand to the scope a little bit.","Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS","Similar with Los Cerritos house it seems you came in a little below where you were thinking is any changes to the plan there just better than I expected pricing?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No it just the finalizing in the negotiations on the two big deals. So we now have it's an estimated numbers we get hard numbers.","Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","I just good afternoon apologize for that. I would just hope you could make some comments about what you're seeing is that retail outlook specifically traffic at your malls and what that could be indicative of going forward?","Art Coppola","I think the most telling number is our total sales numbers that we've shared with you today over the past 12 months which were up 4%. On traffic, in our centers is pretty much flat to down 1% which is pretty substantially different in the numbers that have certain companies that claims to be expert in measuring traffic has published about shopping malls.","And look we now is at the centers that we own today are extremely attractive places to be and retailers want to be there and customers want to shop there.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thanks Tayo.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would to like to turn the conference back over to today\u2019s speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. Again I would encourage you look at the some of the photos and rendering you will find that are new supplements might give you a little better feeling for some of our development projects so that\u2019s new to our supplement, feel free do that. And if you are in the Tysons area please stop by and take a look at the new plaza it\u2019s really pretty spectacular and really appreciate your support and look forward to speaking with you and meeting with you over the balance of the year.

Today's conference is being recorded. And now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. During the course of this call, we will be making certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at macerich.com.","Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Kingsmore, Execute Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean, and thank all of you for joining us today. It was a solid quarter with good operating metrics. Sales per foot were up 10% to $801 per foot. That's our 12th consecutive quarter of sales growth. Occupancy was 94%, up 20 basis points from September 30, but down from 95.4% at the end of 2018. This was primarily due to the 2019 bankruptcies.","Average rents were up 3.3%. We continue to experience strong leasing volumes across a wide variety of categories with 2019 leasing activity up nearly 20% compared to the prior year. The leasing in 2019 included a significant amount of leasing to mixed-use in nontraditional retail uses that are or will be bringing heightened consumer traffic to our high-quality town centers. This includes 4 hotel deals, including Caesars Republic at Scottsdale Fashion Square, 5 co-working deals, most of them with Industrious. We agreed to 3 Lifetime Fitness deals plus 1 Equinox. 5 years ago, these uses did not exist in malls. We expect this trend to accelerate as we move into 2020 and 2021.","We completed an extensive 2019 financing plan, which generated over $550 million of excess loan proceeds and liquidity for the company. We continued to pursue noncore asset dispositions. We're under contract to sell our 50% share of the residential tower at Tysons Corner. In addition, we are under contract on another disposition of a noncore mall and are in negotiations on another. For the year, we expect proceeds from noncore asset sales of approximately $300 million, and that has been factored into our 2020 guidance. Conversely, we have discontinued our efforts to joint venture any of our top-tier assets.","FFO per share was $0.98, matching consensus and same-center NOI growth for the year was 65 basis points, which was within our initial guidance range. This was accomplished in the face of significant retailer headwinds that occurred in 2019, the effects of which we see continuing into 2020. We expect to see same-center NOI growth this year of 0.5% to 1% with that accelerating in 2021.","On the redevelopment front, our pipeline continues to progress well. In September, Macerich and PREIT opened Fashion District Philadelphia. The property features a unique mix of full price and flagship retail, outlet retail, restaurants, entertainment and coworking uses. Tenants such as Century 21, Burlington, Nike, AMC Theaters, Round One and City Winery are now open and operating. The performance has been strong. And since mid-September opening, the property has had over 3 million visitors. Future tenants with signed leases include, among others, Industrious, Sephora, Kate Spade and Ardene.","In spring of 2021, a 2-level flagship Primark will open on Market Street. We are pleased by the opening in the first holiday season, and we look forward to continued tenant openings at this unique downtown destination. Financial contributions from the asset are expected to continue to escalate in 2021 and beyond. We have executed leases and or spaces open for 84% of the space with another 10% committed.","Significant progress continues on the repurposing of our recaptured Sears locations. Construction is underway at 4 of these properties. New tenants will open starting in the third quarter of 2020. Entitlement efforts continue on the 2 larger mixed-use projects, Los Cerritos Center and Washington Square, 2 of our top 10 assets. Both projects will include significant non-retail and mixed-use components.","We expect to be partnering with mixed-use experts on these 2 projects and other densification redevelopments. We anticipate groundbreaking on Washington Square in mid-2020 in preparation for a late 2021 grand opening. The uses at Washington Square are expected to include entertainment, food and beverage, creative office, hotel, all surrounding a plaza that will be the gathering and focal point leading into the new mall entry.","We're pleased with the tenant demand in pre-leasing, and we will announce tenant names as we execute deals over the coming quarters. As mentioned, our intent is to bring mixed-use components such as multifamily and hotel to both Washington Square and Los Cerritos with some combination of ground leases and partnerships with multifamily and hotel developers with a minimal capital outlay on our part.","Our redevelopment estimates for the Sears projects are $130 million to $160 million over the next several years. We expect attractive yields of 8% to 9% on the retail redevelopments and 9% to 10% for the mixed-use.","The variety of uses that will be featured at all these former Sears locations is extremely compelling and will significantly boost productivity and consumer traffic.","At Scottsdale Fashion Square, all components of this multifaceted redevelopment are firing on all cylinders. What once was a low-traffic wing leading up to a low-performing Barney's department store is now anchored by a flagship Apple, a fully occupied Industrious, and includes a new roster of exciting brands made possible by the addition of Apple and Industrious.","Several hundred yards down the property, the luxury wing is rich with luxury brands including Breitling, Burberry, Cartier, Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Saint Laurent, Ferragamo and Tiffany. Most recently, Nobu, Scottsdale and Toca Madera are the latest additions to the restaurant expansion. With the pending additions of Equinox and Caesars Republic in 2021, this latest wave of investment of this asset will be complete. Sales are nearing $1,500 per square foot.","And with the continued opening of the high-traffic and high sales uses in the expansion, the leasing demand at Scottsdale Fashion square remains extremely strong. Our portfolio features a tremendous collection of assets situated in markets with outstanding demographics. The leasing environment is good and improving with a broad and diverse set of new users.","The strategic vision for our town centers is abundantly clear. They will anchor our communities and will be a focal point where our consumers repeatedly visit to shop, to dine, to be entertained and in a growing number of instances to work and live. In some cases, the investments may be minor and others may be more significant. As Doug will mention shortly, we are very enthused by the long list of significant projects that will start generating significant NOI for us in 2021.","And now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the results for the quarter and summarize our very significant 2019 financing activity.","Scott Kingsmore","Thank you, Tom. The fourth quarter reflected good financial results matching both company and street expectations. Here are some highlights for the quarter and for the year.","FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.98 per share and 2019 FFO was $3.54 per share, both matching consensus per first call. The $0.98 in the fourth quarter represented an $0.11 decline from FFO of $1.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018, given primarily the following factors:","One, higher leasing expenses of approximately $5 million, driven by the new leasing accounting standard; two, lower lease termination income of $2.6 million; three, higher interest expense of $2.1 million; four, a favorable tax appeal during the fourth quarter of 2018, totaling roughly $3.5 million at one of our New York assets. This ultimately created an unfavorable comp in the fourth quarter of 2019; and then lastly, lost anchor rents from Sears the bankruptcy of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter.","Same-center net operating income was flat during the quarter and finished up 0.65% for 2019, which fell within our 0.5 to 1.0 same-center NOI guidance for 2019. As we had mentioned on prior calls, we anticipated growth in the second half of 2019 to be lower than the first half of 2019 as a result of the bankruptcies, including Forever 21, and that was in fact the case.","During 2019, the impact of both 2018 and 2019 nonanchor bankruptcies had an approximately 2% dilutive impact on 2019 same-center NOI growth. EBITDA margin showed significant improvement in 2019. The EBITDA margin increased by 90 basis points from 62.7% in 2018 to 63.6% in 2019.","This morning, on to guidance, we did provide a detailed 2020 earnings guidance, and we direct you to the company's Form 8-K supplemental financial information for more details about those guidance assumptions.","2020 funds from operations is estimated in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share and same-center NOI growth is estimated to be in the range of 0.5% to 1%. While many guidance assumptions are provided within our supplemental filing, I would like to provide some further details. Similar to last year at this time, we thought it would be useful to highlight a few major components to help reconcile from actual 2019 FFO of $3.54 per share to our -- the midpoint of our FFO guidance for 2020, which is $3.45 per share.","One, we anticipate approximately $0.06 of decline in 2020 versus 2019 from the combination of reduced straight line rents and SFAS 141 income. These noncash line items can be choppy, especially when we are required to write-off tenant balances as a result of early pre-lease expiration store closures as was the case in 2019; two, we have included, within our guidance, $0.03 of expected dilution from disposition activity including from Tysons Vita and other noncore dispositions that we are currently focused on; three, as a reminder, there is continued rent loss from Sears that rolls into the first half of 2020, contributing to approximately $0.03 of dilution. Recall, this does not impact same-center results; four, at Fashion District Philadelphia, we anticipate 2020 year-end occupancy of roughly 80%, and year-end 2019 occupancy was approximately 65%. Given this occupancy ramp and the fact that capitalized interest on the project is substantially lower in 2020 now that the project is open, this property is only modestly FFO accretive to Macerich in 2020, but will significantly contribute to the company's FFO in 2021 and beyond.","Lastly, a few other notes regarding guidance, we have embedded approximately $0.06 or 100 basis points of general reserves for rent loss into 2020 same-center NOI guidance. We will monitor and adjust this figure as the year progresses. In terms of FFO by quarter, we estimate 23% in Q1, 25% in Q2, 24% in Q3 and the balance of 28% in the final quarter.","While we are certainly not giving forward-looking guidance into '21 and future years, we remain very optimistic about the financial tailwinds from numerous small and larger scale redevelopment investments in '21 and beyond. Again, please refer to our 8-K that was filed this morning for further information.","On to financing activity for the year. To recap the 2019 activity, we were extremely active last year in the debt capital markets. In total, we closed 9 deals totaling over $2 billion or $1.4 billion at the company's ownership share. This yielded over $560 million of liquidity and available capital to the company. The average interest rate across these loans was 4%, and the average term was 9.3 years. These 9 financed assets included Fashion Outlets of Chicago, shops at Atlas Park, SanTan Village, Chandler Fashion Center, Fashion District of Philadelphia, Tysons Tower, West Acres Mall, Kings Plaza; and lastly, One Westside.","During the fourth quarter, we closed 2 major deals. On December 3, we closed a $540 million refinance of Kings Plaza. This 10-year CMBS loan bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 3.62%. The proceeds were used to refinance an existing $427 million loan and to repay a portion of the company's line of credit. Given the existing debt was amortizing and the new loan is interest-only, the new mortgage will provide over $10 million of annual cash flow savings.","On December 18, our joint venture in One Westside closed a $415 million nonrecourse construction financing, on the soon to be new Google creative office campus in West LA. The loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.7%, which reduces to LIBOR plus 1.5% once Google opens. The facility will cover JV's remaining share of development costs.","Looking into 2020, we do anticipate financing Danbury Fair Mall, Green Acres mall and another unencumbered A mall asset, and we believe those assets will be very well received within the financing market and should generate in excess of $400 million.","Now I will turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment.","Doug Healey","Thanks, Scott. In the fourth quarter, sales remained strong and leasing momentum continued. Portfolio sales ended the fourth quarter at $801 per square foot, which represented a 10.3% increase from $726 per square foot at the end of 2018. Economic sales per square foot, which are weighted based on NOI, were $916 per square foot, and that's up 7.9% from $849 per square foot a year ago. 2019 year-end occupancy was 94%, and that's up 20 basis points from last quarter and down 1.4% from year-end 2018. This is primarily due to 450,000 square feet or 2% of our GLA being rejected and closed through bankruptcies in 2019. Temporary occupancy was 6.3%, and that's unchanged from December 31, 2018.","Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.7%, and that's down from 11.1% from year-end 2018. In addition to affecting occupancy, the 450,000 square feet or 2% of our GLA that was rejected and closed through bankruptcy, also put downward pressure on 2019 leasing spreads. So at this point in the business cycle, and as Tom stated, we believe the opportunities to drive occupancy and increase cash flow are more prevalent through leasing velocity and vacancy backfill. Average rent for the portfolio was $61.06 and that's up 3.3% from $59.09 1 year ago.","Leasing volumes remained extremely strong throughout 2019. During the fourth quarter, 233 leases were signed for nearly 1 million square feet, bringing the 2019 totals to 938 leases signed for just over 3.5 million square feet. And this represents 18% more leases and 19% more square feet than what was accomplished in 2018. And this excludes Fashion District Philadelphia, which we'll discuss in a moment.","We continue to leverage the strength of our powerful portfolio by executing on several key packages of deals. They include 4 deals with Amazon for both their Books and 4-Star concepts at FlatIron, Cerritos, Scottsdale and 29th Street, and that totals 18,000 square feet. Additionally, we made deals with Ardene, a Canadian fast fashion retailer at, Freehold, Deptford and Fashion District Philadelphia, totaling 28,000 square feet. We made 3 deals with BoxLunch at South Plains, Valley River and Vintage Faire, and then 9 deals with Lovisa, a fast fashion jeweler out of New Zealand. And this brings our total business with Lovisa to 11 stores when you include the stores already open in Los Cerritos and Fashion Outlets of Chicago.","The large-format space continues to be very active. We signed leases with Dick's Sporting Goods at Vintage Faire for 45,000 square feet and Crunch Fitness at Deptford for 28,000 square feet, both of those in vacant Sears boxes. We also signed leases for Ross Dress for Less at Pacific View for 21,000 square feet and adidas at Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls for 10,000 square feet.","It's obvious that the large-format category is becoming more important and more influential than ever, and we believe it's currently one of the most efficient ways to drive occupancy and increase cash flow. By way of example, if you take the large-format uses that are signed or at lease in the Sears boxes at Deptford, Vintage and Chandler as well as the soon to be vacant Forever 21 boxes at Danbury and Arrowhead, and then you layer in Life Time Fitness at Broadway Plaza and The Oaks, Equinox and Caesers Hotel at Scottsdale Fashion Square, by the end of 2020 and into 2021, we're looking at bringing online an additional $10 million at share of incremental annual revenue. And we're still in the very early days within this large-format sector.","In the food and beverage category, we signed leases with Bamboo Sushi at Biltmore Fashion Park, Bubba's 33 at South Plains and Shake Shack at Danbury Fair. This brings our total number of deals with Shake Shack to 11, making Macerich one of Shake Shack's largest landlords.","We signed multiple leases with digitally native and emerging brands in Q4, including Morphe at Arrowhead,Tecovas at Kierland Commons, Purple at Santa Monica Place, Warby Parker at 29th Street and gorjana at The Village at Corte Madera and Broadway Plaza.","Further on Tom's comments on Fashion District Philadelphia regarding its grand opening, it was another very strong quarter for FDP in terms of leasing. We signed 8 leases for almost 90,000 square feet, including key deals with Primark in 47,000 square feet, Sephora in 7,500 square feet, Kate Spade in 3,500 square feet, DSW in 15,000 square feet and Ardene in 12,000 square feet.","And while we are happy with what we transacted on in 2019, we know it's important, especially in this volatile retail environment, to get out in front of our business by addressing our 2020 lease expirations now. To that end, I'm pleased to report that between signed leases and leases out for signature, in terms of square footage, we are 63% completed with our 2020 business. And when you include active LOIs, we are almost 90% completed with our 2020 business.","In the fourth quarter, we opened 105 new tenants, totaling 339 square feet. And this is in addition to the 65 new tenants, totaling 205,000 square feet, that we opened in the prior quarter. Retailers of note include a 23,000 square foot H&M and a 10,000 square foot Salon Republic at The Oaks; Toca Madera and Zinque, two first to Arizona restaurants at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Roots and THE VOID at Tysons Corner Center; Five Below in 10,000 square feet at Freehold Raceway Mall; we opened 5 abercrombie kids stores, totaling 15,000 square feet; and lastly, we opened ULTA and Ross Dress for Less in about 35,000 square feet at Superstition Springs, which finalized the backfill of vacant Sports Authority box.","Digital and emerging brands continue to migrate towards bricks and mortar. In the fourth quarter, we opened 6 more locations, including Amazon 4-star at Village of Corte Madera, UNTUCKit at Freehold Raceway, Purple at Santa Monica Place and Havaianas, Stance and Tommy John at Scottsdale Fashion Square.","Also in the fourth quarter, we opened another 8 locations with YM, the Canadian fast fashion retailer out of Canada, who bought the rights to Charlotte Russe. These 8 locations totaled 50,000 square feet. The final 2 deals in the YM packet will open Q1 2020, bringing the total to 17. So after the liquidation of Charlotte Russe, which occurred in Q2 2019, leaving us with 25 vacant locations totaling 160,000 square feet, between YM and a couple of other retailers, 21 of the 25 locations that Charlotte Russe vacated have already been backfilled.","So in conclusion, the leasing environment remains strong. As I've been saying for the last several quarters, we believe the time is right to take advantage of the current disruption in the retail environment by uncovering and securing new, exciting and cutting-edge uses across the multifaceted categories within our properties. Yes, we'll continue to rely on our legacy retail partners, especially those who have used the last several years to reinvent themselves. But it does not, and it cannot stop there. As we know, times have changed, our shoppers changed and shopping patterns have changed.","In 2019, we made it our mission to uncover the latest and greatest brands and uses to help adapt to these changes. And I'm extremely pleased with our progress.","In 2019, we signed 94 deals totaling 150,000 square feet of all new to Macerich tenants, tenants that we've never done business with in the past. So in the end, 2019 was both a challenging year and a rewarding year. But most of all, I believe it was a year in which we changed our thinking and set the ground work for whatever the future may bring.","For 2020, our goal is simple. We continue to morph our properties into best-in-town -- best-in-class town centers through transformational and creative leasing. Town centers that will be something for everybody in places where folks will want to gather and can, in fact, actually work, shop and play. And as we do just that, I believe Macerich will continue to have one of the strongest and most sought-after portfolios in our industry.","And now I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","I wondered if you could give us expected incremental NOI increase coming from Scottsdale Fashion Square and Fashion District Philadelphia for 2020.","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure, Craig. This is Scott. Start with FDP, incremental NOI, if I were to look at our pro forma, you can probably triangulate to 4.5%, 5% or so. But again, bear in mind that capitalized interest offsets, right? So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it's only modestly accretive in 2020, while we anticipate significant accretion in '21, '22 and beyond. Scottsdale Fashion, for the most part, is sitting in our same-center. The expansion space that includes restaurants and fitness is not in our same-center. So that is accretive. I currently don't have a number. It's certainly above our portfolio average given all the leasing activity. I don't have the figure for you offhand though, Craig.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, I just wondered what is the potential impact if Prop 13 would pass for Macerich?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Craig, Prop 13 has been challenged many times in California over the last 30 years or so. Apparently, they've got enough signatures, it's going to be on the ballot, but we know it's not polling well. So for a variety of reasons, we think it's a long shot that, that initiative to turnover Prop 13 or converted to split tax rolls probably will not be successful. But in our case, we structured our leases, almost all of them, as fixed CAM, but we have continued to build property taxes on a triple net basis. So we don't think it's going to have much impact. We realize that, that's going to put some incremental pressure on occupancy cost as a percentage of sales, but we don't think if it were to pass, which again, we think is a long shot, we don't think it would have any immediate impact on FFO or same-center NOI.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.","Alexander Goldfarb","First question is just, Scott, just going over the same-store pool, I didn't hear you guys talk about Forever 21. So one, just confirming that it's still your prior guidance of $0.08 impact. But two, when you guys go through your same-store guidance this year of 0 -- of 0.5% to 1%, how much is already reflected, not in that number, but how much of the portfolio is already having drag from closings last year? Meaning, are you starting the year off with like 50 basis points of 2019 closings? And then does the 50 basis points -- sorry, does the 100 basis points of bad debt -- sorry, that's what I meant, does the 100 basis points of bad debt, does that already include what you know has closed to date, meaning like Forever 21 and, therefore, there's 100 extra? Or is the 100 already includes stuff that's already closed this year?","Scott Kingsmore","Alex, I'll take all those. I'm not sure I can remember all 5, but I'll try and do my best here.","2020 same-center guidance embeds within it, as a result of the 2019 bankruptcies, approximately 200 to 225 basis points reduction of same-center NOI. That includes the general 1% budgeting reserve that I mentioned in my opening remarks. Same-center also includes the impact of Forever 21. I'll just refer back to the comments that we made in the third quarter call as to what the impact there is. We said roughly $0.08 was the impact on an annualized basis and that roughly $0.02 of that would be felt in 2019 and the balance in 2020. All of that will hit same-center.","In terms of what is and is not in our same-center pool, Fashion District of Philadelphia hits our same-center pool in the final quarter of the year, Q4.","Our Sears boxes are not in our same-center pool. And again, that does have some bearing on the first half because we did receive some rent in the first half of 2018 that we certainly are -- excuse me, first half of 2019 that we're certainly not receiving this year. The expansion area for Scottsdale is not in our same-center pool.","And then lastly, One Westside is pretty inconsequential given the fact it was closed pretty much most of 2019, but that is also out of our same-center pool. So hopefully, that answers all your questions.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. And then, Scott, on the 100 basis points of credit reserve for this year. Is any of that already being used? Or is this all incremental, meaning, whatever you may have gotten notices for so far this year, is that in part of that 100 or that's incremental to the 100?","Scott Kingsmore","It's incremental, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Then the second question is asset sales. Last time you talked about possible, I think, about $80 million of -- I think it was like apartment sale in the fourth quarter, then maybe some additional sales aggregating about $280 million. Didn't hear anything like that, but certainly noticed in your dividend composition from last year, you guys earned $1.35, you had gains of $0.65, but you still maintain the full $3 dividend. So as we think about everything for this year, are we still thinking about asset sales. And for that, you're still planning on keeping the dividend? Or are the asset sales no longer part of the calculus as you think about your 2020?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, Alex, as we look at 2020, the focus has shifted to selling noncore assets. And in those, we typically don't have the same elevated tax gain or capital gain as we would if we sold one of our top 10 assets or top 20 assets. So to some extent, there were tax considerations in 2019 that don't exist in 2020.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But you're still going to maintain the same dividend payment despite that it's a pretty good source of capital. And the market sort of pricing -- they're not pricing you on the current dividend, they're pricing on something less than that.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Okay. Let me see if I've got this one right. But if you're asking about the dividend, that's a Board action. It's not my decision. So I can't speak for the Board here, but I will tell you that last week, the Board did approve and we declared a dividend of $0.75 per share, which was consistent with prior. And that's a Board decision and if the Board addresses it quarterly before they declare the dividend, then they're aware that there's room of about $1 a share in terms of the nontaxable part of the dividend that could be used if they deem it so appropriate. But to date, the Board has not been interested in making that change, but it's their decision.","Operator","You will now hear from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy","Just to follow-up on Alex's question on asset sales, $300 million, that includes the $82 million for the 50% interest in Vita, which hasn't closed yet. Just in regard to the other $200 plus million, you mentioned the noncore mall under contract and then another noncore asset in negotiation. Do those 3 assets comprise the entire $300 million? Or is there an expectation for others? And is the noncore asset under negotiation a mall or a non-retail asset? Just maybe some color on that.","Tom O\u2019Hern","So those 3 will get fairly close to $300 million. And there maybe 1 or 2 other small assets that are noncore for us that may be dispositions this year. And other than the apartment tower at Tysons Corner, the other assets are noncore malls.","Christy McElroy","And can you give a sense for cap rates on those noncore malls?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. And if I could, I'm not so sure that they would be very relevant because a lot of those assets don't have a lot of EBITDA, but they do, in fact, have some pretty good real estate value and the potential to do other things like multifamily.","Christy McElroy","And then just in regard to your capitalized interest guidance of $25 million in 2020, I would have thought more of that would have started to be expensed as you delivered Scottsdale and you continued to stabilize Fashion District, how should we be thinking about the moving parts of that number as more of the interest related to those 2 projects are expensed, but is there anything else that's sort of being added to CIP or added to the pipeline beyond what you've listed in the development schedule that would impact that number?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, Christy. Yes, certainly, bear in mind that our projects, all of our Sears boxes are going to be factored in there. We've got a couple of large-format uses that we feel very good about the opportunities on, couple Forever 21 boxes. And those will be in the numbers. One Westside is, obviously, we're throwing hammers, and that's going to be factored in there. Bear in mind, Scottsdale was a multiphase project, and so a lot of that was already placed into service throughout 2019. Certainly, the wing that now features Apple and Industrious was fully in place for all of 2019. So you don't have much of a decline there year-over-year. Fashion District, frankly, is the biggest year-over-year decline. But again, there's continued reinvestment back into the portfolio in our high-quality Sears boxes, One Westside. Like I said, a couple of larger format Forever 21 stores that we are at lease on right now, and we feel very good about.","Christy McElroy","So those Forever 21 boxes will go into CIP, but they remain in the same-store pool?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, 2 different concepts. We typically carve-out of same-center our major redevelopments. But when it comes to repurposing boxes and spending development capital to the tune of that order of magnitude, GAAP allows that to be considered construction in process that allows you to recognize capitalized interest. So they are really 2 different concepts, Christy.","Operator","And Jim Sullivan with BTIG has the next question.","Jim Sullivan","Yes. Scott, thanks for providing that reconciliation in terms of the items that gets you from the same-store guide to a per share number, the midpoint of the per share got $3.45. I just wanted to clarify, because you listed the Sears box, as you said, that was not included in same-center and then you itemized, I think, 1% $0.06 a share for kind of a loss reserve. So when you report the same-store, however, you typically will reflect any credit loss in the same store, is that right or no?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, that's correct. Really, the 1%, Jim, is just budgeted rents that we're carrying a reserve against for potential fallout. We'll continue to assess that throughout the year. That's a bit different than the notion of bad debt where we're writing off uncollectible receivables. Also inherent within our guidance is a bad debt expense estimate of $7 million, and we provided that on Page 10 of our supplement. So in addition to that, $7 million of uncollectible bad debts, we have an additional 1% of general reserves against potential fallout that we'll monitor as we progress.","Jim Sullivan","And that $7 million number you gave, yes, that was indicated I know on the guidance page. But I guess, it's -- I guess, the issue is between the same-store number and those items. I know lease term is excluded in 1 or 2 of those other items, but I would have thought that the reserve would have been the same. It would already be the 0.5% to 1%. In other words, would be the same as maybe when you start the year with in each case, no, i.e., $0.06 would be incremental?","Scott Kingsmore","Well, the $0.06 is -- so maybe -- maybe we're not speaking the same language here. The $0.06 is embedded within our thinking for the 0.5% to 1% same-center NOI guidance. But the -- I think, Alex's question was, is any of that Forever 21, for instance, or other known bankruptcies, inherent within that $0.06 or 100 basis points of general reserves? And the answer is, no. It's all incremental on top of what we know today.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Now, I understand that.","Scott Kingsmore","Exactly.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Yes, maybe we can follow-up on this off-line, but we're just trying to -- I'm just trying to connect the dots from, obviously, the '19 result, adding some $0.03 to $0.06 of positive contribution from the same-store guide, and then making the adjustments that then take the number back down to $3.45. So we can follow-up online on that or off-line on that.","I also want to talk about the refi proceeds. I know in between -- the consolidated assets between 4Q maturities and 1Q maturity, you've got about almost $600 million of maturities. And you had talked, I think, in your prepared comments, about financing on Danbury and Green Acres and another mall. And I think you mentioned something like $400 million in proceeds. So I guess, the question is Fashion Outlets of Niagara, what are you anticipating there at this point to the extent you're comfortable talking about it? And number two, on Danbury Fair and Green Acres, are you anticipating excess proceeds to the maturity or no?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, we are. Danbury Fair is a 10-year maturity. And given continued investment and progress and value creation at that asset over the course of a 10-year period, there's certainly the opportunity to extract extra value out of that one. And we do anticipate excess proceeds.","Green Acres is very much the same way, even though we've only owned the asset for about 7 years. I recall we did build a very substantial power center adjacent to the project. And frankly, the performance of Green Acres mall is well beyond our expectations. And I do think there is the opportunity to extract excess proceeds.","The third asset I mentioned, not by name, but I did describe it as unencumbered. And so I do feel very good that, that asset, which performs extremely well, will result in some excess proceeds.","I think the last question you asked was Fashion Outlets of Niagara. We're still evaluating that one. It's very possible at this time, we may unencumber that one, but we'll be reporting back on that one over the course of the year.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Just first follow-up on the same-store forecast. Scott, I think you commented that Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia comes into the pool in the fourth quarter. Things like that could have an impact on the full year forecast. And just given the ramp you're expecting to experience in occupancy, and I presume rental income, what's the impact that Philly has on the full year same-store growth forecast?","Scott Kingsmore","Sure, Todd. Well, given the fact that it's only 1 quarter, it's not going to be a massive impact. What I can say, though, is as we look into 2021, Philadelphia will certainly be a major contributor as well as lot of these larger boxes that are going to be coming online. One of the consequences of getting this real estate back, leasing it up, prepping the space for tenant delivery and, ultimately, building out the store, is it takes about 18 to 24 months for that income to come to fruition and actually to get those tenants to open and operating. We are looking at -- towards the end of this year and the beginning of '21, having a significant inventory of that space coming online, which is the figure that Doug mentioned earlier. So we do feel good about the contributions in '21.","Circling back specifically to your question, though, the '20 contribution from Philadelphia in the fourth quarter, there certainly is one, but it's not very significant in light of -- it's a single asset for 1 quarter.","Todd Thomas","Okay, got it. And then, Doug, I apologize if I missed this, but I think temp and short-term leasing contributed to about 640 basis points of occupancy last quarter. Can you share where that was at year-end? And can you comment on how you expect that to trend throughout the year?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, Todd, this is Tom. I think the number at year-end was 6.3%, so pretty consistent with the third quarter. And I think that was flat with last year, but there's a pretty strong initiative here to convert temporary space to permanent space because there's a significant pickup in rent between a temp tenant and a perm tenant. So that's going to be a big push this year.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Can you quantify that a little bit? Do you have a sense for where rents are for that bucket? How much of a lift do you see on average when earning short-term leases to permanent?","Tom O\u2019Hern","It's usually a 50% pickup in rent when you convert. And the goal of this year would be to knock that down by 75 or 100 basis points to take it closer to 5% from 6.3%, it's at today. And we've got a team of people that specifically focuses on converting temps to perm.","Todd Thomas","Okay, got it. And just one last question also on leasing. You discussed some of the leasing activity in '19, the progress that you've made on the 2020 expirations. Can you just comment specifically on the leasing spreads in the quarter in the consolidated portfolio. They sort of -- they came in sharply this quarter. I was just curious if you can discuss what that's attributable to?","Doug Healey","Yes, it's Doug. So it all really depends on the property and the market. In our top-tier centers, as we look to execute on the 2020 business, we're executing at positive decent spreads. However, in some of our lower tier centers, it may be more of an occupancy play. Obviously, when we're working to drive occupancy, it does come at the expense of rate, which affects spreads, but I wouldn't say that's the case in the majority of our properties.","Operator","Now we'll move to a question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","I guess, first, there was an article yesterday about Intelsat filing for bankruptcy. And I know that's a large office tenant you've got in Tysons. Any just sort of commentary you can provide around that tenant, space needs and how you think that might play out?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, they were one of our original tenants, Steve. And around the time they went public was about the time we opened Tysons Tower 5 or 6 years ago. And they've been an anchor tenant there with, I think, 3 or 4 floors. That being said, that market is pretty strong today. We're actually considering doing more office there. And we don't think it would be too difficult if it came to that. We don't believe it will, but if it did come to the situation where they did file and we had to make some decisions, there's a much stronger office market today than there was when we originally did that deal. And we, in all likelihood, would get a rent pickup as a result of taking that rent to market if it comes our way.","Steve Sakwa","But there's nothing baked into the 0.5% to 1% for any kind of dislocation or disruption from that. Is that correct?","Tom O\u2019Hern","That's correct.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Secondly, can you just, broad picture, give us -- maybe I missed it, kind of the funding needs that you have for developments, redevelopments in '20, '21 and '22?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, on average, Steve, we're going to be $250 million to $300 million, and that's about what we were this year. And Scott went through the refinancing liquidity that we generated, and that was roughly $550 million. So there was liquidity well in excess of our capital needs generated this year. On top of what may come out of the financing pipeline, we're also deep in either contract or negotiations to sell some noncore assets, which will generate some additional liquidity. And we very well could continue that game plan as we move forward into 2021 and beyond. It's long been a goal of ours to sell our noncore assets if we can do it cost effectively and without a big earnings impact. So that's an avenue we're going to continue to pursue in terms of generating liquidity to cover our very accretive redevelopments.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then just maybe one for Scott, just in terms of how you think about assets going in, going out of the same-store pool. I guess Fashion District of Philadelphia is obviously still ramping and really doesn't even stabilize until -- it sounds like it's in the 80% range and gets into the 90s, even a year from now. But it sounds like that's going into the pool in the fourth quarter of '20, although it's not really stabilized yet. I just -- is it just a strict definition of 13 months and the asset goes in? Or is there something a little bit more specific as to how you think about that or the new wing in Scottsdale when that gets added?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, you're pretty much spot on, get 4 full quarters, and then it gets into the same-center pool. The fourth quarter of this year happens to be the anniversary for Fashion District. Let me just expand a little bit on the occupancy because the stats can be a bit deceiving. We do anticipate occupancy, as I mentioned, roughly 80% by year-end 2020. But bear in mind that there are 3 major spaces at that property that happened to be unique that are carrying into '21. Primark, we expect to be a spring '21 delivery.","It's roughly 50,000 square feet, 2 levels on market. It's going to be a great flagship anchor for us. In addition, there's 2 destination spaces on the east side of the project. And collectively with Primark, that's nearing 15% of the space. So it's a bit deceiving when I say 80%, but the core of the mall is certainly going to be more occupied than that, but there just happened to be 3 distinct spaces that are going to trickle into '21 that are going to drive some significant financial results in '21 and beyond.","Operator","Now we'll hear from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.","Linda Tsai","Could you tell us how much Intelsat was paying in terms of rent since that is included in your credit loss, if I heard that correctly?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Linda, we don't provide specifics on how much each tenant pays. It would be very detrimental to the leasing negotiations in a lot of cases. We don't provide those specifics.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then since you sold the multifamily at Tysons, would you consider selling the office at some point?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Certainly. I mean when we built those, it was our stated intention that we didn't necessarily plan to build them and hold them forever, but as long as we own them and could control the development and how they were oriented towards the 2 million square foot powerhouse mall, we were going to do that and that's been done. The transit station has been built there and both assets are doing quite well. And that has actually turned that location, that entrance to the mall, into the number one location. But we do have an open mind going forward, and that could possibly be a candidate to be sold along with our other noncore dispositions.","Linda Tsai","And then can you discuss what drove your decision not to JV 1 or 2 of your top 20 assets? And what it would take for you to revisit that concept?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, I'm sure this is no surprise to you, but today, retail real estate, particularly mall real estate, is out of favor with institutional investors. Even the very high-quality assets including the 2 or 3 that we exposed to the market, there's just not strong demand right now. We like those assets. We're glad to hang on to 100% of them. They are core assets for us. And we will generate liquidity through selling noncore assets, as I mentioned.","Linda Tsai","And then just one last one. What's driving the lower occupancy cost ratio on your unconsolidated centers? It looks like you ended the year at 10.8%. And then last year, it was 11.5%. And in 2017, it was 12.7%. Is there kind of a target ratio you'd like to achieve? And just what's driving that?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, I mean, you've got a lot of factors. Sales have been up. In some cases, you've got some bankrupt tenants that had a high-occupancy cost as a percentage of sales that are coming out of the equation, so that's pulling that number down. And I suspect that's the biggest reason for the drop versus the prior year.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller","You talked about the temp to permanent leasing goals, but where do you see the overall 94% occupancy level going by year-end '20?","Doug Healey","It's Doug. I think between our temp to perm efforts and our focus in 2020 in leasing the vacant space that we've gotten back to us, I think we could see our occupancy increased by 100 basis points, from 94% to 95%.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Sorry if I missed this, but I just want to go back to the asset sales. The $300 million, it was a net number, assume that those include some debt that's going to go away, making the gross proceeds higher. So maybe you can just quantify the gross expectations there? And then just to be clear, it sounds like those will be outright sales as opposed to any sort of JV, is that right?","Tom O\u2019Hern","In all likelihood, they will be outright sales. There's a couple of possibilities where it may stay in for a small JV interest, and all those assets that we're considering in this group of noncore dispositions are unencumbered.","Jeremy Metz","All right. Helpful. And then just in terms of the percentage rent, you had pretty good uplift in 2019. I guess, there's 2 parts in that. First, as part of that lift you saw just being driven by converting some tenants to percentage rent, and that's helping kind of push it higher. And then I guess, second is just how we should think about that here for 2020? Obviously, I think there's a desire to convert that to base rent, but maybe that's on the market on the cards. Any color there?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure, Jeremy. I don't think conversion to percent of sales deals is what's driving that. It is a positive sales environment. Positive sales doesn't necessarily translate to each and every tenant. But we do have some tenants that have surpassed their breakpoints that I can't mention properties or tenants specifically, but that's what kind of drove the result uniquely. Percentage rent as a whole really has not been impactful to our entire rent structure. So I don't think that's going to be a significant driver. It's certainly nothing we point to, to say that's something we can do to drive 1% same-center growth by any means. But it's not a -- or it's not a function of converting to grow skills.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","So I guess, thanks for the color on the planned refinancing activity for this year, the $400 million of incremental liquidity you outlined. But that is new debt after all and your debt EBITDA sits here around 9x. So I guess my question is, as you consider the 2020 outlook today, the development NOI coming online and the refinancing activity planned this year, I guess I'm curious when we could start to see that EBITDA figure improved? Where do you think that will be by year-end and perhaps year-end '21?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. So there's obviously 2 sides of that equation. And the debt that's being incurred with the refis and also the additional EBITDA that's coming online from assets like Fashion District Philadelphia, Scottsdale Fashion Square as well as the Sears projects. And then I think we're really going to see that start to decline as we accelerate same-center NOI. Going forward into 2020, we certainly expect that to be a stronger year for same-center growth than this year when we're still absorbing some of the bankrupt space. So we think that's going to come down gradually naturally. And I think there's actually a chart in our investor deck, which I don't have memorized, but if you take a look at that, I think you'll see what our expectation is for debt-to-EBITDA going forward.","Haendel St. Juste","I do recall that chart, but if I recall correctly, I think that chart did not include a Forever 21 bankruptcy or some form of the challenges that they see now to get more updated perspective. But I do appreciate those thoughts. And what is the unencumbered NOI today or as of the fourth quarter for the portfolio?","Scott Kingsmore","Unencumbered NOI, I'd tag it roughly 15% to 20%.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. And then lastly, Corte Madera, looking at your top 20 malls, looks like sales per square foot are up across the board with the exception of Corte Madera, your #2 mall. Sales per square foot there looked to be down 10% year-over-year and 15% from last quarter. Can you discuss what's going on there? What that's attributable to? Is that a temporary blip? Or is there something more meaningful we should be aware of?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. Corte Madera, we had a couple of tenants that are moving around, just as part of some redevelopment activity. And I think that's really what's driving that. We have some high-octane tenants that are experiencing some temporary downtime as they relocate that happen to shift out of the sales pool and they'll be back into the sales force. So I think that's a temporary disruption in the figure.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. That's something that you think is 2021 of that perhaps to get -- see the sales migrate back to where they were? Or is it going to take a bit more time?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, I would think so, Haendel.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Tom for closing remarks.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jake. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you and speaking with many of you over the coming months.","Operator","With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"13969":["Macerich Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. During the course of this call, we will be making certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at macerich.com.","Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, CEO, Scott Kingsmore, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Doug Healey, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Kingsmore","Thanks, Jean. The fourth quarter reflected generally good operating results as evidenced by the strength in most of our portfolios key operating metrics and an improvement in same center net operating income growth. As we mentioned numerous times on our last few earnings calls, the bankruptcies and early terminations in 2017 tempered growth in the first half of '18 as we worked through releasing in that space. As predicted we realized stronger operating growth in the second half of 2018. Here are some highlights for the quarter.","FFO per share was $1.09 per share, which beat our guidance and met consensus estimates. Annual FFO per share was $3.85, excluding $0.13 for activism related costs, incurred earlier during 2018. This was in line with our guidance of $3.82 to $3.87 per share. Yearend occupancy was 95.4% up 40 basis points from yearend '17 and up 30 basis points from September 30, 2018. Half of this gain of 40 basis points was temporary occupancy. Same center growth net operating income excluding lease termination revenue was up 4.2% for the quarter, or 2.4% increase when including lease term revenue. During the quarter we did realize a favorable multiyear tax appeal of one of our wholly-owned assets, which equates to roughly 150 basis point improvement to quarterly growth.","For the second half of 2018 we experienced 4% growth versus the second half of 2017 when excluding lease termination revenue and 3.4% growth including lease termination revenue. The property operating margin for 2018 improved by 60 basis points to 70.0% up from 69.4% for 2017, and REIT G&A and management company expenses collectively showed about $2.3 million improvement over a reduction during the quarter.","Now onto 2019 guidance. We have provided detailed operating guidance this morning we thought it would be useful to share a reconciliation of major components from actual 2018 FFO of $3.85 per share excluding activism versus the 2019 guidance of $3.69 per share at the midpoint, which excludes a $0.15 year-over-year reduction that we expect from the new lease accounting standard. Most of these assumptions are spelled out within the guidance table within our supplemental filing from this morning, but this should help you to get from 2018 to 2019.","One, we anticipate approximately $0.10 of accretion from year-over-year savings and corporate overhead from our 2018 reduction in force and from other G&A reductions all net of tax. Two, we expect approximately $0.12 of dilution as a result of increasing interest expense in 2019, driven primarily by increasing LIBOR and the impact of refinancings and higher rates. Three, we expect approximately $0.08 of dilution from loss rents from anchor lease terminations primarily from Sears. This is of course short-term cash flow dilution while we execute on long-term value creating opportunities within what is generally very well situated real estate. As of the end of 2018 several Sears stores have closed, but none of the Sears leases have been rejected today and we have assumed rents for only the month of January for those closed locations. Depending upon what actions are taken by Sears and by the bankruptcy judge, this assumption could prove to be conservative. Four we expect approximately $0.04 of dilution from the combination of reduced lease termination revenue, straight-lining in rents and SAS 141 income.","And then, lastly, on the disposition front, a couple of factors. One, we anticipate approximately $0.03 of dilution from the carry forward impact of 2018 dispositions on 2019. And secondly, we generated approximately $0.03 of land sale gains in 2018 but we have not forecasted any land sale gains in 2019.","Lastly, a few other notes regarding guidance. Other than Sears there have been three major bankruptcy filings so far this year and we are prudently carrying reserves in anticipation of this, and further tenant retailer fall out. This is weighing down our anticipated operating growth in 2019. We also entered into numerous new store leases and renewals upon lease expiration with a significant retailer at reduced rents. This will also lay on 2019 operating growth. This retailer generally occupies big-box locations and in line spaces greater than 10,000 square feet. We have no new acquisition or disposition activity planned within our 2019 guidance. In terms of FFO by quarter, we estimate 22% in the first quarter, 24% in the second quarter, 25% in the third quarter and the balance within the fourth quarter. And lastly, more details of the guidance are obviously included within our 8K and supplemental financial information that was reported this morning.","Onto the balance sheet, as we highlighted for you last quarter we expect to raise between 425 million to 450 million in liquidity from the company's mortgage refinancing activity during 2019. In early January, we closed on our 300 million 12 year fixed rate financing on Fashion Outlets Chicago at a fixed rate of 4.58%. This transaction yielded 100 million of incremental proceeds which we use to repay a portion of the company's line of credit. We are now close to entering into a commitment for a $220 million 10 year fixed rate financing on San Tan Village in Gilbert, Arizona, which we anticipate closing in the second quarter. This transaction would yield roughly $85 million of incremental liquidity. ","We are currently marketing Chandler Fashion center in Chandler, Arizona for long-term fixed rate financing of that market dominant class A regional shopping center. And then later this year, we plan to refinance Kings Plaza. Our product continues to be very much in favor within the debt capital markets. With that I will turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment.","Doug Healey ","Thanks Scott. In the fourth quarter, sales and occupancy remained strong and leasing velocity continued. Portfolio sales ended the fourth quarter at $726 per square foot which represented a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis. Economic sales per square foot, which are weighted based on NOI were $849 per square foot and that's up from $770 per square foot a year ago. Occupancy was 95.4% and this represented a 40 basis point increase year-over-year. Trailing 12 month leasing spreads were 11.1% compared to 10.8% at September 30, 2018, and 15.2% for the year of 2017. These leasing spreads included 32 leases with rent reductions at lease expiration. Excluding these 32 rent reductions leasing spreads would have been closer to 13%.","Average rent for the portfolio was $59.09 per square foot and that's up 3.7% from $56.97 per square foot a year ago. Leasing volumes were strong, during the fourth quarter, 279 leases were executed for a total of 984,000 square feet bringing the total activity for 2018 to 825 executed leases for a total of just over 3 million square feet. Notable leases signed in the fourth quarter include Google at Westside, Nordstrom at Country Club Plaza, a flagship Tesla at Santa Monica Place, Dick's Sporting Goods at Deptford, Dave & Buster's at Vintage Fair and Crayola Experience at Chandler Fashion Center. We also had a very significant opening in the fourth quarter and that was a luxury wing at Scottsdale Fashion Square. ","And we also opened a concept called brand box at Tysons Corner. Brand Box is first-of-a-kind technologically induced venue that provides flexible space for emerging brands to test bricks-and-mortar. A 10,000 square feet Brand Box opened 100% occupied with five emerging brands and one legacy brand who is looking to reinvent themselves. We are already talking to three of the brands to do a permanent long-term deal elsewhere in the center, which of course is our ultimate goal. In addition, we opened 13 emerging brands in the fourth quarter notables include Bonobos at Village of Corte Madera, Stance at Washington Square and Madison Reed and Invisalign at Broadway Plaza.","We remain active in the restaurant box categories with significant openings in the fourth quarter, including Din Tai Fung in Washington Square, Cheesecake Factory at South Plains and Tocaya Organica at Kierland, Burlington at Lakewood, 24 Hour Fitness at Pacific View and Ross at Southridge. Other key openings throughout the portfolio include Anthropologie at Chandler, Polo Outlet at Fashion Outlets of Chicago and two Hollister stores at Green Acres and Victor Valley.","Looking at our industry and leasing in particular, we remain cautiously optimistic as we focus on 2019 and beyond. The mood continues to improve, open to buys are more prevalent and brand extensions are once again being talked about. The labor market is good, gas prices are down, holiday 2018 was strong and consumers are in a spending mood. However, this does need to be somewhat tempered due to perceived economic headwinds in 2019, as well as continued store closures.","Traditional retailers that continue to reinvent themselves and focus on their product, through service, their experience, are thriving. Great examples are Apple, American Eagle, Hollister, Vans and Sephora. Boxes, restaurants, fitness, theater, entertainment, experiential and international brands are all active. Our shoppers, especially the millennials and the Gen Z's, they want it all, they want the right stores, they want food and beverage, they want aesthetics, they want to be served and they want to be entertained. And that\u2019s exactly what we are focused on at the property level. From our store selection to the service we provide, to the experiences we create, Macerich continues to be an industry leader.","And lastly, I recently came across what I thought was a very interesting article written by the ICSE. In 2018 the ICSE commissioned an outside strategy and research firm to conduct a study to track retail web traffic and consumer brand awareness among emerging and established brands. The study is titled the halo effect how bricks impact clicks. I'm sure many of you have read this study, but for those who haven't, I would strongly encourage you to do so. In the meantime, I'd like to point out four big takeaways.","Number one, for existing retailers opening one new physical store in the market results in an average 37% increase in overall traffic to that retailer's website. Number two, increasing the number of physical stores by just 5% in a single market has significant benefit on digital engagement and web traffic. Number three, for emerging brands new store openings drive an average 45% increase in web traffic following the store opening. But the opposite is also true, web traffic drops when retailers close stores, in one retailer's case the share of web traffic across markets where they closed declined up to 77%. So in conclusion, existing retailers have incentive to expand into new markets or to expand within existing markets. Existing retailers have reasons other than cost of occupancy to keep stores open in key markets and in key shopping centers. And lastly and most importantly, it is now proven that emerging brands have all the incentives in the world to open physical stores.","And with that I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you Doug. We had a good fourth quarter. If you look at FFO diluted it grew by 6.5% to 166 million, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Occupancy increased 40 basis points on a year or year-over-year basis. We had good leasing volumes. But releasing spreads are low still in double digits have moderated from 2017 levels. Our malls continue to generate healthy traffic and certainly continue to generate positive sales growth and attract relevant brands and concepts.","As Doug mentioned, we continue to see the leasing tone change mostly for the positive. Legacy brands are clearly differentiated between those that continue to invest in their brand and product their in-store experience and into their omni channel strategies versus those that are struggling mainly because of the weight of historical leveraged buyouts and related balance sheet issues. While we continue to see an improved leasing environment with generally strong retail sales, we do remain concerned over certain brands.","Being able to recapture unproductive department store boxes within great malls will continue to provide significant redevelopment opportunities for us. We have two compelling recent examples of that. In Kings Plaza where we took on underproductive Sears store and replaced it with Zara, Burlington, Primark, JC Penny which collectively will do five times the sales of the prior tenant. At Scottsdale Fashion Square, we replaced the Barney's department store with Apple and Industrious.","You will see us do upgrades in other centers where we have the opportunity to recapture department stores. There is also demand for adding mixed-use including residential, hotel, entertainment, health and wellness and office components. These are compelling opportunities for us to diversify our cash flow sources over the course of the next five years.","Looking at a prime example of this as Scottsdale Fashion Square where development continues on a 80,000 square-foot exterior expansion which includes restaurants and well-recognized high end fitness club. The expansion is a 100% leased and includes tremendous collection of high-end restaurants including Nobu, Ocean 44, Farmhouse and others. Within the former Barney's location, we opened a two level flagship Apple Store which features extensive experiential and educational elements. In January two weeks ago Industrious a national co-working operator opened a 33,000 square-foot premium co-working space. It was the best opening they have ever had and far exceeded their typical opening-day occupancy.","It is expected that Apple and Industrious will generate substantially more traffic and commerce than was previously generated by the 60,000 square-foot Barney's department store box. Also at Scottsdale Fashion Square, we debuted at newly renovated and re-tenanted luxury wing with an exciting lineup of new or newly renovated retailers including Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Breitling, Saint Laurent, Omega, St. John, Ferragamo and many more.","In addition, at Scottsdale Fashion Square we are adding a hotel. Caesar's Republic a 266 room first of its kind non-gaming Caesar's brand will be built at the center. This four star hotel will be developed by a third party on a ground lease. The hotel will be ideally located adjacent to the 80,000 square-foot expansion.","Turning now to Fashion District of Philadelphia, construction continues on a four level retail and entertainment hub standing over 800,000 square feet in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. We have signed leases or commitments from 85% of the leasable area. Notable tenants include Century 21, Burlington, H&M, Nike, Forever 21, AMC, Round1, and City Winery. At One Westside, formally known as Westside Pavilion we, along with our partner Hudson Pacific Properties recently announced that we have signed Google as the sole occupant the sole tenant to occupy approximately 600,000 square feet of Class A creative office space. The joint venture expects to invest approximately 500 million to 550 million and we expect to see 8% return on this project.","At Los Angeles premium outlets the Carson Reclamation Authority has commenced its site work to support LA's newest outlet project. This is a 50-50 joint venture with Simon Property Group to develop a 566,000 square-foot fashion outlet center with frontage along the heavily traveled I-405 freeway in Los Angeles. The project will open in two phases. The initial 400,000 square feet is currently anticipated to be delivered in the fall of 2021.","Last quarter, I shared details as to our remaining Sears stores. I'll briefly update you on the current status. We have 21 Sears stores and they are broken into different ownership groups. The first group is nine Sears stores that are owned in a 50-50 joint venture with Seritage. Six of those nine are now closed and the three remaining open appear to be part of the Sears going concern portfolio, which includes Arrowhead, Danbury and Freehold. Both Danbury and Freehold already have been 50% converted to smaller Sears footprints by virtue of leasing half the space to Primark. These nine stores are some of our best malls with average sales over $800 per foot and we have plans for all of these locations with a wide range of opportunities, including demolishing the box, and repurposing the square footage with more productive uses. At this time, although six of these are closed none of these leases have been rejected. So as of today, we do not control these locations yet.","Moving now to the second group, seven of the Sears locations are owned by Macerich and are leased to Sears for a very nominal rent. Of those seven stores four are closed and three remain open and appear to be part of the Sears going concern portfolio, including Green Acres, Stonewood and Victor Valley. Group 3 includes five Sears stores, four of which are owned by Seritage, one of which is owned by Sears. Of those five, three are closed and only Inland Center and Pacific View remain open. The outside lease rejection date is May so it could continue for a few more months before the leases are rejected. And while it is uncertain when or if we will gain control our planning and leasing efforts continue assuming that we will gain control of these boxes. As Scott mentioned, we have assumed a significant rent loss within our 2019 guidance for anchor terminations the majority of which pertains to Sears.","In closing, as we move into 2019 we are looking forward to continued progress on our redevelopment opportunities. We are encouraged by the improved leasing environment and tone, but keeping in mind that we also see retailers that are not going to make it through the year without closures, including some big names that have filed bankruptcy within the past two weeks.","And now I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jim Sullivan of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan","Tom just curious in the prepared comments, there was a breakout of FFO by quarter which is helpful of course. But in terms of the same store NOI guide for the full year which of course, is somewhat disappointing, but we understand why you are providing it. Can you help us understand kind of how that should change over the year? Back in 2018 of course it was weaker in the first half stronger in the second. Within the overall 0.5% to 1% guide are you assuming a similar trend in '19?","Tom O'Hern","Well, part of it Jim is the comp period and as you mentioned we had softer same center in the first two quarters of '18, stronger in second half. So that would mean the second half of '19 we would be facing tougher comps. Also, it remains to be seen how quickly we will get some of these stores back. So for example the three tenants that filed bankruptcy within the last two weeks Gymboree, Charlotte Russe and Things Remembered, collectively have 90 stores with us. And we are not sure how many of those stores will close or how much rent concession will be requested by those tenants so those all could be first half of the year impacts. So Scott, unless you have a different opinion, I would say that will probably be fairly consistent through the year in terms of the same center numbers.","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, I would agree Tom. The biggest wildcard is the bankruptcies that are in front of us which are likely to be weighted towards the later three quarters, given the fact we are in February today Jim.","Jim Sullivan","And then a quick follow up for me. On a sequential basis the sales per foot number at Biltmore was down significantly. Is that simply the result of the Apple Store move to Fashion Square?","Doug Healey","Yes, Jim, it's Doug, that\u2019s exactly right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Samir Khanal of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Samir Khanal","Scott or Tom, I guess could you just maybe help us better understand the range of sort of $3.50 to $3.58 on FFO? What are some of the biggest swing factors that get you off the midpoint either to the low-end or the high end of that range? And also maybe to the extent you could maybe help us think about where consensus was wrong maybe coming into the guidance release here.","Scott Kingsmore","I think we mentioned a couple things in the prepared remarks that could swing either way. The timeliness of when Sears rejects leases is certainly a dictating factor. We have assumed that the lion share of our Sears portfolio stops paying rents as of February 1. So that could prove to be conservative. Obviously there is proceedings going on right now and we will see how that shakes out. We mentioned the tenant bankruptcies and dependent upon the volume of closures, and the timeliness of those proceedings that could certainly influence the range, like termination income is always one of those that's hard to pick, we provided guidance that it's estimated at 12 million, which is down from last few years, so that\u2019s certainly a factor.","And Samir I apologize what was the second part of your question?","Samir Khanal","No, I'm just trying to understand maybe where you guys were -- I'm just trying to get help in trying to figure out where you were -- why your guidance was off so much from consensus and why consensus was sort of wrong coming into the quarter. I know you guys sort of looked at all the models of the analyst. Just trying to see what was it that that we may not have picked up in the guidance.","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, let me touch on the few things. Obviously we have been clear about our perspective on interest rates being a headwind. So we provided succinct disclosure in terms of what those figures are. But elsewhere, obviously, same center is a surprise relative to where I know you guys modeled so that should be factored in. The anchor closures that we provided are year-over-year impacts at $0.08 of dilution in 2019, that\u2019s going to be a factor. We obviously sold a few centers in 2018 there is going to be a carryforward dilutive impact. We commented on that that could be an area. And then I would say lastly 2019 is a relatively light year in terms of contributions from our redevelopment pipeline. We have got some accretion from projects like Philly and Kings but bear in mind that Philadelphia is a late in the year opening and there is going to be some ramp to the openings there through the mid part of 2020. Kings Plaza came online during the middle of '18 so part of the accretion from that project was felt already. And then cutting the other way we have projects such as Westside Pavilion which is obviously winding down, Paradise Valley which we continue to lease on a short-term basis to give us maximum control to redevelop that site. So some of those factors kind of cut the other way.","Lastly, bear in mind also we announced our Norstrom lease at Country Club Plaza. That comes with some repositioning of real estate and that is probably something you didn\u2019t factor in as well. So I think in total development contributions are probably in the $0.02 range,$0.01 to $0.02 and you may have factored into your model. So those are a few highlights but I'll be glad to take it offline and do a reconciliation with you Samir.","Samir Khanal","Just as a follow up. We have seen strong increases in sales but it then look like it's translated into percentage rents here. How should we think about that line item for '19?","Tom O'Hern","Well, there is very small percentage of tenants paying percentage rents. You are not going to be able to make a direct correlation. I think we are going to continue to see a trend down somewhat in 2019. Our preference is always to get base rent and fixed CAM charges rather than percentage rent. So typically as leases expire and we renew, we try to increase the base rent and with that we end up getting less percentage rent from any given tenant. I would expect that to continue.","Operator","We will now take our next question Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","I was wondering how much of a drag on the same center NOI is related to the restructuring of the leases versus just vacant space?","Scott Kingsmore","Craig, this is Scott. We mentioned a few factors there was a significant retailer that we did upon lease expiration had probably upwards a 20 agreements that we ended up restructuring. It\u2019s a retailer that typically occupies a bigger footprint. And those were generally not closures. They were in the most impactful instances downsizings us to enable us to reposition that real estate with retailers that we think will perform significantly better. So there is that factor. And then in terms of our estimates for potential fallout from bankruptcies for instance, there are some closures that we are aware of at this point in time as a result of going out of business sales from the retailers that have already filed. But then on top of that there is just a general estimate for what is likely to be a rent restructuring.","Tom O'Hern","So in our guidance Craig we've actually factored in an occupancy reduction during the course of 2019 of anywhere between 50 and 100 basis points.","Craig Schmidt","And then just the cadence of store closings in the malls, specialty space has been pretty active in the first six weeks of '19. Are you expecting that to maintain that? Or would it start to trail off just given the overall strength of the consumer?","Tom O'Hern","Craig typically the first quarter is bankruptcy season, they defied that a little bit in 2017 where it seemed to go up throughout the entire year. That being said, in terms of specialty tenants, 2018 was relatively light year in terms of bankruptcies and closures. But we typically see most of it in the first quarter. These three tenants that I mentioned that have filed in the last two weeks not really a surprise, surprised when they actually do it, but they both, all three of them have been on our watch list for a number of years. So the timing and the coincidence that all three filed within two weeks probably made our view of 2019 a little bit more conservative than it was even a month ago. So I would say that we do expect to see more this year. I expect it to be front end loaded. And again, that's fairly typical.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Todd Thomas","Just first question I guess Scott a little clarification. So you mentioned the three major chains filing bankruptcy are announcing closures in '19 to date that are embedded in the guidance plus that assumption that\u2019s on top of that for some additional fallout. Can you just break out how much NOI loss above and beyond what's known today and what that represents in terms of the same center NOI growth forecast?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure, Todd obviously we don\u2019t have succinct visibility into the exact impact for any of these three, but suffice it to say that we are carrying about 100 basis points of dilution in our same center guidance as a result of all this.","Tom O'Hern","Because even though we know who has filed on those three that we've been talking about and that\u2019s 90 stores, historically, we would see maybe 50% of those stores close 25% renegotiate the rent terms and 25% remain unchanged. At this point, we don't have the visibility into any of those three as to what the ultimate outcome is going to be.","Todd Thomas","But that 100 basis point speculative cushion I guess, that includes additional activity in addition to the change that you have discussed is that correct?","Scott Kingsmore","That's correct Todd.","Todd Thomas","And then just back to Sears, so on the anchor rent loss so I'm not mistaken, it sounded like you assumed the February 1st liquidation of Sears altogether, but there is your three major stores still open, three of the Seritage boxes are still open, so how much of the $0.08 per share dilution that\u2019s in guidance is related to anchor rents that's already accounted for with stores that are closing how much of that is also sort of I guess speculative in nature?","Scott Kingsmore","Well, so, again the $0.08 assumes what's closed is rejected effectively as of today. If you were to look at the balance of the portfolio, which is probably what you're trying to get at Todd if it were to be a full liquidation declared today there is probably about a $0.015 of remaining exposure from Sears. Most of the stores that are closed today are the higher rent paying stores and with relatively rare exception what remains pays very little rent.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Tom, in the fall, you talked about some opportunity to drive additional common area leasing I think it could potentially deliver upwards of 5 million a year of incremental revenue potential. Just can you give us an update on that opportunity there and how much you are factoring in into the outlook here for 2019?","Tom O'Hern","That continues to be a big focus and push for us to continue to take advantage of the common area and populate it with things that not only generate revenue but activate the common area. I think we've got maybe $0.02 a share incremental that's in there for that which is a bit less than 5 million. But hopefully it can outperform and we get closer to 5 million rather than 3 million or so that we projected.","Jeremy Metz","On the G&A front any comments on you feel about overhead cost today, you had a fair amount of savings in 2018. So is there a room for further savings there? Is that something that\u2019s in the model?","Tom O'Hern","Yes, I think Scott mentioned that. The big positive impact of the reduction in force will be felt in 2019. In 2018, we had the reduction in the early in the year, but we also had an offsetting fairly generous severance payment to those individuals. So the real benefit will come through 2019 and that's roughly 12 million of savings.","Jeremy Metz","But does that assume any additional incremental savings or is this -- that all just a carryover?","Tom O'Hern","That\u2019s primarily there has been additional cuts but not as significant as that. And we will continue to work on that as well.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Tom, just two questions. So on the first question if I hear you guys correctly because you guys had previously disclosed the overall the estimate revisions about $0.04 negative impact from Sears. So it sounds like there is now additional $0.04 to make it total $0.08. The bankruptcy is if you said it's the 100 basis points that sounds like another $0.06. The shrinking anchor I'm guessing Forever 21 but whoever that anchor is it sounds like that's an undisclosed amount. So right now I'm at $0.10 of the $0.20 delta roughly between the street and where your guidance midpoint is. So how much else is this the shrinking anchor how much is that? And then what are the other missing parts that you guys haven\u2019t already disclosed previously that makeup sort of that $0.20 delta from the street is to where the midpoint of your guidance is?","Tom O'Hern","Well Alex, one aspect to that was the occupancy reduction we expect to see. But I don't think that had been discussed with you in terms of your model and others. Part of that is influenced by the heavy bankruptcy activity we have seen already in the first six weeks of the year. So that\u2019s certainly an aspect of it.","Scott Kingsmore","I was just going to say I'll also add what I mentioned to Samir which is take a look at your underwrite for development accretion in 2019. We expect that to be probably less than what you have modeled Alexander.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the $0.05 impact from Heitman that's not in guidance, is that something that\u2019s going to run through FFO? So the guidance range should be effectively $0.05 lower? Or what's that footnote about?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure the footnote is a confusing accounting pronouncement that came in into effect January 1, '18. Our interest expense Alexander is really just interest from debt. But I\u2019d just point out in the footnote that if you are modeling those two assets which are consolidated assets and are 100% you have to factor in a deduction for our partners 50% share of those assets, which is reflected within interest expense. So it's really just meant to be a clarifying edit for you clarifying footnote to make sure you're capturing a deduction for our partners have share of those two assets.","Alexander Goldfarb","So it's not that FFO guidance is actually $0.05 lower, that\u2019s just purely accounting.","Scott Kingsmore","That\u2019s correct, purely accounting and is really meant to be a modeling footnote for you.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then if I can, on the Sears, Tom how much capital do you expect that Sears will take? And what's your split between backfilling as is versus ripping down and redeveloping?","Tom O'Hern","Right now we have got 250 million to 300 million as kind of a placeholder Alex in the development pipeline. Again, right now, we are not entirely sure which ones are going to get back. Seritage as we said six of the nine are closed. Those will be likely candidates we have got some pretty good prospects there. And I would say as we look at it today about half of those Sears boxes that we would get back would be a redeemizing exercise and half would be situations where we would knock the square footage down and repurpose that square footage elsewhere on the various sites, including some mixed use, health clubs, entertainment, potentially some offices as well, hotel. But we don't know right now as we look at guess which ones are going to get back its going to be about 50-50.","Operator","We will now take the next question from Christine McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christine McElroy","Just following up on the $0.08 of impact from anchor terminations, is all of that assumed to be driven by Sears? Are there any other anchor closures in there? And how much of that $0.08 is impacting same store NOI in terms of loss rent or co-tenancy impact? I think you exclude redevelopment from same store NOI. So, I'm presumably, the Sears boxes once they are rejected they go into the redevelopment pipeline.","Scott Kingsmore","Hi Christine, this is Scott. Yes, you are correct on the latter comment. The anticipated reduction of rents comes out of the same center pool. The lion's share of that $0.08 does relate to Sears. We have very little exposure for instance to Bon-Ton and their bankruptcy which occurred in roughly late summer of 2018. But there is a little bit of carryforward impact from that. But again the majority relates to Sears.","Lastly, as it relates to co-tenancy, as we have mentioned to you in the past the co-tenancy was relatively minor. To the extent there\u2019s any impacts, so those have been reflected in our numbers. Of course those are -- there is a time delay for those so it's really relatively minimal to 2019. But that would be embedded within our same center numbers and it's already been factored in.","Christine McElroy","Okay, got you. So the $0.08 is largely outside of the same store.","Scott Kingsmore","Correct.","Christine McElroy","And then just following up on Alex's question just with the assumed 30 million of capitalized interest. With the Seritage JV, Sears boxes are now in the shadow pipeline. What does your cap interest forecast assume, just with regard to those Sears boxes in terms of the timing of rejection and when you start capitalizing the cost basis of the JV? Because I think that cost basis you immediately would start capitalizing the 150 million as soon as those go into the pipeline.","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure Christine. So just in terms of rough numbers, so there\u2019s 150 million in terms of our basis, two thirds of those stores have closed so roughly two thirds of that basis we started capitalizing interest effective February 1. So when we assume the loss of rent we will assume the capitalization of interest.","Christine McElroy","Okay, so it's based on the closure and not on the lease rejection.","Tom O'Hern","No it would be based on lease rejection but in the guidance we had assumed that everything was going to be rejected as of February 1. So it's somewhat conservative in that regard.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Hawthorne of RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Hawthorne","I also want to talk about some of the leasing conversations you are having. Are you guys still able to get about 2% ish of contractual rent increases?","Doug Healey","It's Doug, yes, its 2% between 2% and 3%.","Brian Hawthorne","Do you get that pretty consistently? Or is it kind of tough to get?","Doug Healey","No it's pretty consistent.","Brian Hawthorne","And then my other one just on tenant retention how does that look at lease expiration and has that changed at all?","Doug Healey","Its Doug again, not really. The tenants that are suffering the ones that are closing stores, obviously we're not trying to retain them and given our portfolio that's 95% 96% leased we are proactively going out and trying to replace those nonperformers. So I would say that retention is in our hands and we are doing it depending on how we want to merchandise the center and with whom we want to merchandise the center with.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay, I mean I guess, so when you kind of talk about that, is that tenant retention kind of being stable I guess, I mean is that anything on a square foot basis it's stable? Or is that on a number of stores basis? I guess what I'm getting at is are your current tenants taking like downsizing?","Doug Healey","Depending, some of the tenants that have a big footprint have found that they can do the same amount of business or more business in a smaller footprint. So in some instances yes they are but in other instances those that are just sort blowing it out and sales realize that they need to be a little bit bigger, so it really does depend on the retailer. But I would say right now, it's more popular to be small than it is to be larger.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Regarding the big box rent reductions, how is the new rent decided? Was it tied to a new occupancy cost ratio? And then in terms of the lease structure, was the term shortened? Or did they go to percentage rents?","Scott Kingsmore","This is Scott. So we are talking about a package of multiple stores. It's very much a give and take negotiation. In some instances we were able to capture very important new stores, new leases. When you look at the entire package, there was a select few where the retailer just had a big footprint and needed to shrink. So we effectively gained control with the ability to re-tenant that space with much more productive merchants. So that\u2019s kind of the dynamic to paint with the broad-brush but it was very much -- there were wins as well as concessions.","Linda Tsai","And just to be clear, this was for one retailer or different retailers?","Scott Kingsmore","One retailer.","Linda Tsai","And then I think earlier H&M said they were going to close 160 stores in this year. Do you know if any of these will be in your portfolio?","Tom O'Hern","None that we are aware of.","Doug Healey","Correct.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","Just a first question around the new guidance I think it implies extremely tight FAD coverage of the current dividend with little incremental capacity or undertaken increase load of I think the redevelopment that you are going to be facing. I was curious what thought the board had given to reducing the dividend to retain more cash particularly in the event you face some extreme capital need in the future. I guess, in the event that were to occur whether it\u2019s a redevelopment or for debt reduction how do you guys think about capital sources to fund any future obligations like that?","Tom O'Hern","Jeff I think Scott went through a lot of liquidity plans we have as a result of the refinancing as a result of San Tan Village and Chicago and Kings Plaza. We should see 400 million of excess proceeds, which will be temporarily used to pay down our line of credit and then used for the redevelopments. The board addressed the dividend in last quarter and we increased it very modestly, $0.01. So we have just recently addressed that. And I think our liquidity is more than enough to get us to through the redevelopment pipeline. And also as you look at this year that since our growth rate of 0.5% to 1% is not something we expect to be the new norm. If you look over the past 10 years, we have averaged same store NOI growth of 3.2%. So to me this is a low point and we would expect same center NOI and cash flow to grow at a much more robust rate as we move into 2020 and beyond. Again some of these bankruptcies that are causing the tightness in the same center are tenants that we have had on our watch list for three or four years. So in some respects the fact that they are going through their respective bankruptcies its painful short-term, but long-term it's healthy for the industry and for our portfolio.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe just one last question is I'm just curious how your own vision for Macerich evolved as you move forward towards taking over leadership there. Has that maybe changed at all over the last six months? And maybe a second part to it, your predecessor retired after a 25 years stint at Macerich in his mid-60s you are not too far from that same achievement, sorry to out you, I'm just curious how do you or the board think about succession planning? I know you only took over the helm a month ago but I was just curious what your thoughts are.","Tom O'Hern","Well, a couple of things on that Jeff. I have been here for a while so we have all been part of Macerich team, Ed, myself, Scott and Doug for quite a while. So there are not going to be dramatic changes, maybe a change in the leadership style. And I will admittedly say I'm not quite as committed to some of things that Art was but directionally, I think things are very much the same.","In terms of succession and age I would venture to say I'm probably fitter than most people 20 years younger than me. And if anybody wants to challenge that give it a go including you. So I don\u2019t think the board is too worried about my current age or physical condition. And we just went through succession. So I'm not sure that's at the top of their list right now. But that\u2019s more a question for them.","Brian Hawthorne","I'll nominate someone to take you on.","Scott Kingsmore","Not me.","Operator","We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Curious on the bottom 20% of your portfolio, thoughts on that piece today? Would you be willing to sell perhaps be a little less price sensitive? And then I'm curious as you forecasted that the NOI 50bps to 100bps what is the differential between these upper portion of your portfolio versus the lower portion?","Tom O'Hern","The lower assets really represent pretty small percentage of our NOI I'd say 5% or so. So they are not real big influencers. And there is not a ready market to just go out into the market and sell those opportunistically at a strong cap rate. From our view they are not hurting our portfolio. And to go out there and try to sell in an unwilling market doesn\u2019t make any sense to us. So as Scott said, we have got no dispositions in our guidance as it relates to those lower tier assets. So again we whittled that portfolio down significantly over the course of the period from 2012 and 2017. We sold 25 of those centers. So we reduced that number from about 15% 20% of our portfolio to about 5%. So we are content with those right now. And they did not have a material adverse impact on that same center growth number.","Haendel St. Juste","And then I guess the question on the rent reduction. Do you think the majority of rent reductions for your problem tenants accrued this year? Or you think you will have a few more years of these reductions and to expect the similar impact next year.","Tom O'Hern","It's pretty hard to predict, as I said 2018 was relatively light other than the department stores. This year has been pretty active for the first six weeks of the month. That being said, tenant watch list is shrinking with the passage of time and there\u2019s fewer tenants on there that we are concerned with. As I said the three that just recently filed have been on our watch list for the past three to four years. So I think 2019 impact is not something I would necessarily project to see again in 2020 or 2021.","Haendel St. Juste","And I'm going to try to sneak in one last one. Based on what you just mentioned in your prior response. I'm curious perhaps if you can elaborate on a few of the items that you are thinking versus your predecessor is a bit different about?","Tom O'Hern","Well, I'm not sure I know anybody that\u2019s as passionate about digitally native, vertically integrated brands as Art. So I will probably spend less time on that than he did and conversely and they spend more time working with our redevelopment folks on some of the Sears boxes and what we can do there. Plus we are closer to having those in hand or under control than when Art was at the helm. But look we worked together for 24 years, as did Ed so there is not going to be any radical change in direction as a result of the change of CEO.","Operator","We will now take our next question from DJ Busch of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","DJ Busch","I just want to follow-up on Christine's questions. Scott I want to make sure I heard you correctly. So when we think about the $0.08 reduction due to the anchor move outs and I think you said that those would come out of the same store pool. So how does that work exactly? Does that mean as these anchors close the entire center at which those anchors are located are going to come out of the same center pool and will be moved to the bottom or moved in the redevelopment bucket?","Scott Kingsmore","No DJ, it's just a store itself. Think of Seritage's as a kind of a siloed collection of stores, granted they are attached to Macerich malls but we are just pulling out the store volume in terms of the rent contribution, not the entire mall.","DJ Busch","And is it just for the Seritage stores or is that kind of the practice for other anchor vacancy as well?","Scott Kingsmore","Look what we are dealing with right now is a very nominal dilution from a set of approximately four stores, I think, from Bon-Ton. Very nominal, probably not even worth the words I just spilled out here. It's really Sears and we are pulling it out of same center.","DJ Busch","And then maybe a follow up on Jeff's question. Just you guys addressed the liquidity. You have FOC behind you, you have the other three that sounds like they are in process. So from the liquidity standpoint I understand where you guys are going but just thinking about where leverage is today, just under 9 times, probably moving higher over the next year. When do you see that inflection point, Scott? When should we expect that levers to come back down probably to the levels we saw just even going back maybe two years?","Tom O'Hern","DJ, this is Tom. I'll have Scott check with you. I think you are maybe missing the couple of pieces in terms of net debt to EBITDA because we are close to the mid 8s and we see that moving around a little bit either both above and below that based on the timing of the redevelopments and when they come online. It will gradually start to come down. That being said, we could also, at some point in the future, do a joint venture and generate some equity and delever with that. So other than that one metric we are pretty comfortable with the rest of our balance sheet metrics both maturities schedule, interest coverage ratio, which is north of three times which is pretty healthy. We have reduced the amount of floating rate debt we\u2019ve got. So there is a variety of things. If we do nothing it will stay between eight and nine, but it's also possible we could generate some liquidity through joint ventures and use that to pay down debt as well.","Time for one more operator.","Operator","We will take our final question from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Going back to the question of your watch list. Could you talk a little bit about what else is still on to list? And the reason I asked is that in the context of your guidance the additional reserves or additional conservatism you have in your numbers around the additional store closures or rent loss apart from the retailers that have already announced bankruptcies?","Tom O'Hern","Tayo, we always maintain a watch list depending on a variety of things, tenant sales, occupancy costs as a percent of sales, the financial health of the tenant things like that. And if you look at our watchlist excluding the tenants that just filed and I'm not going to give you specific names of tenants but if we looked at all these collectively I would say there is probably 300 stores in total that are on that watchlist, and that's not an unusual number. I think over the past few years we have had anywhere from 400 to 600 stores on the watchlist. So it's actually down a bit, and the level that it's at today is not unusual. As I said 90 stores were associated with the three tenants that just filed bankruptcy. So that's recently been reduced from about 400 to 300.","Tayo Okusanya","Could you talk a little bit about just the retail categories that some of those 300 stores represent? ","Tom O'Hern","It's pretty much across the board, I mean you got apparel in there, you got jewelry in there and you got some that fall in the general category, but I think the bigger categories would be apparel and jewelry.","Tayo Okusanya","And then just one more for me if you don\u2019t mind. The hotel development with Caesar's you guys don\u2019t have a stake in that but are they ground leasing it from Macerich, what's exactly? Is there any kind of financial interest in that project?","Tom O'Hern","Yes we are ground leasing the land to Caesar's for that hotel. So we will get \u2026","Tayo Okusanya","How long it's going to be\u2026","Tom O'Hern","It\u2019s a long term I can't remember of the top of my head but it\u2019s 20 years or more.","Tom O'Hern","So thank you for joining us today. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us. And we look forward to working with you throughout the year.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Instructions will be provided at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Good morning. Thank you, everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G.

We executed on our plan to dispose non-core assets. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and we had a very strong operating performance during the quarter.","Looking at the operating metrics, the leasing volume and spreads were both good. We signed leases on specialty tenants totaling 330,000 square feet, and we had positive releasing spreads for the trailing 12 months of 7.2%, excuse me, 17.2%. The occupancy level was at 94.6% at the end of the year. That was up 80 basis points from year end 2012.","It\u2019s also important to note when looking at the year-over-year occupancy gain that we reduced our temporary occupancy that is included in that statistic, temporary occupancy at year end, stood at 5.8% and that\u2019s down from 6.9% a year ago. That\u2019s an area we will continue to focus on converting temporary tenants from an occupancy.","Average base rents increased to $48.16, that\u2019s up 8.7% from $44.29 at the end of 2012.","Looking at FFO, the adjusted FFO for the quarter as $0.94 per share, that\u2019s up from $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The full year FFO was up over 10% at $3.53 compared to $3.18 from 2012.","Same-center NOI was strong, growth was strong in the quarter, it increased by 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing spreads annual CPI increases on leases. Year-to-date same-store NOI was up 4.1%.","Also on the same center base, looking at expense recoveries for the quarter, they were up to 96% and that compared to 92% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We had a very modest amount of lease termination revenue in the fourth quarter, that was 600,000, that was down from $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Bad debt expense was also down for the quarter relatively modest level of $1.1 million down from $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Throughout the year, we had significant savings on interest expense due to the significant refinancing we had done over the last two years. Most of that benefit flowed through the first three quarters. During the fourth quarter, the average interest rate was at 4.22% down slightly from the 4.29% at the end of last year.","We also make great progress on our balance sheet. Looking at the balance sheet stats, at the end of this year, compared to 12-31-12, factoring in the acquisition of Green Acres which happened in January, debt-to-market cap went down from 45% to 40.5%.","Interest coverage ratio improved from 2.8 times the 3.2 times. Debt-to-EBITDA improved significantly down from 8.1 times to 7.2 times on a forward basis.","Average debt maturity improved from 5.3 years to 5.9 years. And floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt decreased from 23% at the beginning of the year to 10% today.","In addition, as we look at our maturities schedule, we have very little interest rate sensitivity in our upcoming maturities. We have only $119 million of debt maturing in 2014, and that\u2019s a 4.1%. We have $640 million of debt maturing in 2015 with an average interest rate of 5.5%, and 2016 has $710 million of maturities at 5.8% average interest rate.","This morning, we also gave FFO guidance for 2014 in the range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. That guidance assumes asset sales in the range of $225 million to $275 million and if those sales will occur in the first half of 2014.","The 2014 guidance also includes the dilution of $0.08 a share from those asset sales, plus another $0.16 of dilution from the assets that we sold in 2013.","The above guidance range reflects same-center NOI growth of 3.75% to 4.25%, and there\u2019s no acquisitions after that guidance.","Looking at the quarterly split, we\u2019d expect the first quarter to be approximately 23% of the total, second quarter also about 23% of the total, third quarter about 25%, and the remaining 29% in the fourth quarter at 2014.","We saw nice increase in tenant sales, the portfolio mall, tenant sales per foot were at $562, that\u2019s up 8.7% from $517 at the end of 2012.","Strongest records for us in terms of sales for the year were Arizona and California. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Tom. And welcome to this call. First of all, I\u2019d like to go through and kind of recap the major accomplishments that we had in 2013, and then address some general industry issues that I know all of you are interested in, and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.","2013 was truly a transformational year for Macerich. We gave guidance in the beginning of last year that we had an intent to significantly recycle out of some of our lower productivity, lower growing assets and to take that capital and ultimately redeploy it into proven winners and great developments and redevelopment opportunities that we had within our portfolio.","We ended up having a terrific year with the disposition of 10 malls, and one office related property. The malls averaged about $340 a square foot, and the sales generated almost $900 million of proceeds.","We are currently in the process of various stages of talks, dispose another four or five assets, weaker assets than the ones that we sold in 2013. As Tom mentioned, the range of sales proceeds that we would anticipate from that disposition process which we would expect to be completed in the early part of this year, would be $225 million to $275 million, give or take.","And the productivity of these centers are currently in discussions, are lower than the ones that we sold in 2013, generally somewhere between $250 and $300 a square foot with one possible one in the mid $300 of square foot.","There was a major accomplishment during the year to accomplish a de-levering of the balance sheet through the dispositions and through the use of an equity offering at about $70 a share as part of our S&P 500 inclusion that helped us to de-lever the balance sheet by over $1 billion.","As mentioned, it was a great honor and accomplishment for the company to be admitted to the S&P 500 during the year.","On the development front, we had huge winners across the board. At Tysons Corner, we were successful in preleasing the office tower to a 70% level so that we are able to move forward with the development. That development is moving along very well.","I will suggest that \u2013 weather has been quite an issue as we all know, in the east coast, both at Tysons and Niagara Falls, but that development is moving along terrifically. And again, the densification of that property is going to have a terrific impact on the retail center.","During the course of the year, we completed the total recycling of the department store line up at our Victor Valley Center and the Inland Empire.","JCPenney moved from a small 50,000 square foot store to a new 100,000 foot store late 2012. Macy\u2019s came as a new to market fashion anchor for that market in March of 2013. And Dick\u2019s which we find to be a great anchor for mid-market malls opened in November 2013.","As a result of that, that particular center is one of our highest performing centers in terms of sales per square foot growth. Most of you, a lot of you visited, or have, before or after the grand opening of the tremendously successful fashion outlets of Chicago which opened in August of 2013.","Staying in Chicago, we also had a terrific new anchor open up at our North Bridge Center, Eataly. They opened in December of 2013. And by all accounts, that particular Eataly could even be more successful than the New York one, in any of that, it\u2019s been tremendously well received in the City of Chicago, and it\u2019s already generating significant new tenant interest for the North Bridge Mall which is what we anticipated.","During the course of the year, we continue to clear the land for the expansion, the 175,000 expansion of our very successful fashion outlets of Niagara Falls. We were able to complete that, and we have started the work on the expansion, again, weather has been quite an issue there as you can imagine.","We are currently 55% leased on the expansion, and 81% committed. The grand opening of the expansion itself is still a little bit up in the air. So when you stop on it, you\u2019ll see that it is in the fourth quarter or early the first quarter of 2015, either fourth quarter of \u201814, first quarter of \u201815 all weather permitting. Had we not had the weather issues which I don\u2019t have to tell you all about, it would have been likely November, and we\u2019ll see where we go with that.","We had a terrific year in terms of obtaining numerous entitlements in some sense governmental, as well as other consents that were required for us to go ahead and move forward on the breaking of the ground for Broadway Plaza at Walnut Creek.","This is one of our great properties, it\u2019s anchored by Neiman Marcus, a terrific Nordstrom store, a top 20 Macy\u2019s store in the United States, and we think it\u2019s going to go from being a very, very nice boutique street-oriented type of retail center, to a true super regional center and one of the three dominant centers in the Bay Area. So it\u2019s going to be a fabulous property.","We also, as you can see in and are supplemented, been refining our returns there, and have even a more optimistic view points on our views there.","In Santa Monica, we announced after many years of negotiations with the city, just a couple of weeks ago, that we\u2019re going to be adding ArcLight Theater to the third level of Santa Monica Place. ArcLight is the premiere movie experience \u2013 in Southern California. And we think they will help generate at least 2,000 to 3,000 additional traffic body per year to that third level.","During the course of the year, we were fortunate to be able to buy 20 acres of contiguous land, to Green Acres Mall, one of the acquired centers during the year. And we are currently under way with the preleasing of that center, and we anticipate very nice returns north of 10% when that is fully entitled and then get to open in about two years.","We have announced the addition of two additional anchors at both Scottsdale Fashion Square and Cerritos. At Scottsdale Fashion Square targeted for spring 2015 opening, will be at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, plus a mega cinema complex which will be operated by Harkins Theater who\u2019s the current dominant theater operator in that market.","At Cerritos, we also announced two additional new anchors. One is the remerchandising of the old Nordstrom store that had been relocated a couple of years ago to a brand new store. That will be a theater, Harkins. And also, we announced that Dick\u2019s will be also occupying space there. That\u2019s targeted for fall of 2015 opening.","We\u2019re proceeding very well on our planning for the complete re-merchandizing of Kings Plaza, so we\u2019re very, very pleased with the development accomplishments as well as the development pipeline.","We\u2019re very, very bullish on the opportunity to essentially take the billion dollars of proceeds when you add up this year\u2019s disposition proceeds roughly $1.3 to $1.4 of proceeds that will be generated through dispositions, and redeploy it into a proven winning development pipeline here this year, next year, and the year after. And the returns are going to be very, very significant for the company for the foreseeable future.","Tom mentioned the operational achievements, but just to summarize, same-center NOIs came in at 4.1% which was an improvement of 110 basis points over the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, releasing spreads were extremely strong. FFO came in during 2013, $0.17 above our original guidance for the year, and 11% over the previous year, which we\u2019re very pleased to have been able to accomplish that, primarily driven by the increases in same-center NOI growth.","To be able to accomplish that even though we ended up at the high end of dilution based upon going to the high end of dispositions during the course of the year.","So in summary, if you would have asked me in January of 2013, how I would feel about increasing our FFO that we achieved in 2012 which was $3.18 a share, up to $3.55 a share for 2014, and along the way to de-lever and reload the balance sheet by over $1 billion, to have disposed of 14 or 15 of our lower quality assets averaging just over between $320, $330 a square foot, thereby the increase \u2013 the average sales per foot in our portfolio to something in excess of $570 a square foot, and enable us to focus on proven winners, fewer bigger assets in dense trade areas, I would have said, \"Wow, that would be a terrific year.\" And that\u2019s what we accomplished. And we\u2019re very proud of that.","I\u2019m not unaware though, of the negative sentiment that weighs on the retail sector in general, and that weighs on retailers as well as retail landlords. So I do want to address a couple of issues on that point.","First of all, as it relates to a lot of the talk over Black Friday, Cyber Monday, about the impact of online sales, on brick and mortar sales, I just want to remind you all that the online merchandizing channel that retailers are using today, is essentially the catalogue channels that they used 10, 15, 20 years ago.","So hurrah for all the trees that we\u2019re saving, and hurrah for a new channel being developed that allows retailers to globally expand their businesses through e-Commerce, and to expand and improve their profitability and to really create a seamless transition across all channels.","The dot com world and the catalogue world has been a source of great new retailers for our shopping centers both in the past, as well as the future. There are a number of retailers that were born in the catalogue world that now are some of our best in brick and mortar retailers, there are Internet retailers that were born digitally, that are now, have great retail stores with us. There are digital pure play retailers that never intended to have brick and mortar stores that have recently figured out that they need to have brick and mortar stores in order to really maximize their brand.","And then you have the manufacturer, direct type of folks that really didn\u2019t have to have a brick and mortar presence, but elected to do so in order to create an opportunity for discovery, for entertainment, to create relationships with their shoppers and to actually feel the deal and make transactions.","So the retailers that really \u2013 Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, and even now, Tesla, and other car dealerships that want to use showrooms and \u2013 in our malls, is an emerging category that just proves the strength of the brick and mortar locations.","The best e-tailers are also the best retailers. And for a retailer to have solely a brick and mortar platform, they would not be strong, and likewise retailers realize that they need multi-channel platforms both full priced stores, off price channels, their e-Commerce channels, and now social media which they use tremendously to increase their brand.","A second issue that I know is \u2013 each time there is a hiccup at JCPenney and Sears, obviously, we catch a cold.","Over the past year, we\u2019re very pleased that through the dispositions that we\u2019ve accomplished and the ones that are currently underway, that we\u2019ve gone from 78 to about 56 JCPenney and or Sears stores in our portfolio.","The stores that they\u2019re occupying within our portfolio, we have 18 centers in our portfolio that have both a JCPenney and a Sears, most of those centers by the way have two or three other anchors in many other cases. Those centers average $557 a square foot. So those centers are very, very strong centers.","We have 10 centers in our portfolio that have only a JCPenney. Those centers average about $500 a square foot and includes centers like Queens Center, Fashion Fair, The Oaks, and Valley River, and others where there would be no issue replacing the merchant if you have to.","We have 10 centers where we have only a Sears store, and not a JCPenney store. Those centers also average an excess of $490 a square foot, and they include centers like Kings Plaza or Cerritos, Chandler Center, La Cumbre Plaza in Santa Barbara, all centers that we would have zero problem replacing that merchant if and when something were to happen there.","I would also note that we have 20 assets in the portfolio that have neither JCPenney or Sears. And those assets in our portfolio generates 34% of our net operating income.","The third industry issue that I wanted to just touch upon, and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A, is sales.","Sales is something that I know you\u2019re all are focused on. Sales are very important because rent is absolutely a function of sales. But when you\u2019re operating at a very high sales level, and when the merchants, when they want to come into a market, really don\u2019t have any other opportunities to enter the market other than with you, then you\u2019re able to capture your market share, and we\u2019re able to do that at rents that are appropriate.","I pointed out I think in our last earnings call that even in 2008 and 2009 when we had major sales decreases, we still generated very significant positive releasing spreads. From 2009, year-end 2009, we had a $407 square foot average portfolio sales per foot.","At the end of 2013, we\u2019re at $562 a square foot, almost a 40% increase. But when I look at that, and obviously, I work with our leasing teams, we know that we have great demand for our spaces. I would also point out that roughly two-thirds of our new leasing activity are renewals anyway.","And we only generally renew with merchants that are proven winners. We took a look at our portfolio about a month ago, and we said, if you took a look at each of our top 20 centers, and we have not run this for our bottom 30 centers, but I think it\u2019ll prove out the same, and if you start with the premise that two-thirds of the stores that are there, or belong there, and probably a third of them over time, probably belong to be replaced over a period of time.","And you take a look at the top two-third performers in each of our centers, and you eliminate the bottom one-third, the sales per foot of the top two-thirds in the top 20 centers that we own, goes up 40%.","So for example, in number 11 through 20 of our portfolio, sales per foot would go from $632 a foot, to almost $900 a foot for the top two-thirds of the merchants, and the top 10 centers that we own, sales per foot would go from just over $850 a square foot to something around $1,160 a foot if you eliminate the bottom third. And that\u2019s what we do day by day.","So when we look at it, leasing strength and opportunities, leasing is obviously a function of supply and demand, there is no new supply coming into our markets. There is increasing demand and the productivity of our centers gives us the opportunity to re-merchandize them with new emerging concepts are higher sales per foot than the slower sales tenants that we tend to replace, and the two-thirds of the tenants that we renew every year, they\u2019re able to pay us ever increasing rents because of the ever increasing quality of the portfolio.","So with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question today is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning, good afternoon. After the disposition of the four to five assets in the first half of the year, is this sort of focused disposition over with? Or do you have more assets that you\u2019d like to call following those sales?","Art Coppola","It will be over with for this year. We will be a \u2013 what I look at what we did in 2012 and 2013 and in the beginning of \u201814, I look at this as portfolio management and where we have the opportunity to recycle out of lower growing assets into higher growth and higher productivity centers, we\u2019re going to do it.","But after we complete the transactions that are currently underway, we will time any future dispositions to coincide more coincidentally and directly with the reinvestment opportunities.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And is it possible to get a geographical breakout of sales for the fourth quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern","We don\u2019t have that at out finger tips here, Craig. I can circle back with you a bit. As I mentioned, the strongest locations were California and Arizona. The east was relatively flat by comparison, obviously, weather had something to do with that. And the central was okay, but certainly not at the same level as Arizona and California.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then if you had to guess, what would you think the percentage of difference from weather related cause is impacting the east when you look at California.","Tom O\u2019Hern","You know, that\u2019s hard to say, Craig. Everybody blames the weather. We just know it was certainly one of the worst winters in a long, long time and had impact on a lot of people.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take a question from Rich Moore from RBC Capital.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Anymore thoughts \u2013 you obviously \u2013 or you have a couple of expansions going in the outlet centers. Any more thoughts on maybe new ground up project and outlets? Obviously, they\u2019re still very popular and much like online sales, they\u2019re popular too. I\u2019m just curious where you guys are with that.","Art Coppola","There\u2019s nothing to discuss on that at this point in time.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Art Coppola","But we\u2019re open to \u2013 nothing to discuss.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, got you, got you. Thank you. And then Tom, a couple of items. The higher recovery ratio for the quarter or...","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, Rich, I mean on that, you know, we just continue our move to convert every new lease we do to fix camp. And that has the added benefit of improving our overall recovery rate. Additionally, as we are selling some of our lower quality assets, they typically have a lower recovery rate as well. So over all, I know I gave you the same center calculation, but overall, you\u2019re going to see our recovery rate go up.","If you looked at just the consolidated assets for example, it\u2019s at about 100% for the fourth quarter. So we expect that to gradually continue as we continue to convert more leases from triple net to fixed CAM.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Thank you. And then management company expense was also higher than fourth quarter last year as was G&A, so thoughts on those maybe?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, Rich, the run rate for the management company has been running $23 million to $24 million a year, the full year each quarter.","So that\u2019s a good run rate going forward. I know it\u2019s more than we saw last year in the fourth quarter which was unusually low. But if you look at the first through the third quarter this year, we were running $23 million to $24 million.","On the REIT G&A, we\u2019re slightly higher in the fourth quarter because we had accruals [ph] for professional fees comp, and a few other things that fell through the fourth quarter."," Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","Hi, good morning, guys. Art, excuse me \u2013 I appreciate your comments on e-Commerce, but just so you know, we\u2019re not receiving any trades [ph] yet, I still got like 10 catalogues in my mailbox every day.","Art Coppola","Just say no.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","Regarding the four to five malls that you\u2019re selling, what would you pin cap rate on for the mid $300 small, and then where do you see cap rates for the $250 and the $300 range malls?","And then just regarding that $250 to $300 centers, were those among the assets that you put on the market a year ago?","I\u2019m just trying to figure out is there\u2019s a market for those types of assets now where there wasn\u2019t before?","Art Coppola","Well, we\u2019ll see. There is one asset in the grouping that is what most people would think of it as a B mall. And it may or may not trade. It\u2019s in the mid-350s and that\u2019s consistent with the cap rates that we were able to achieve on most of our transactions in 2013 which was generally low 7s to maybe mid 7s, but more towards the low 7s.","The stuff that is \u2013 the other three or four centers tend to be more in the $250 per square foot zip code, $250 to $275.","It remains to be seen, whether they\u2019ll trade. I do think they may. And we\u2019ll see. If they do trade, we\u2019ll certainly be able to address the cap rates. If I had to guess what the blended cap rate of the four or five assets would be this year and let\u2019s assume there was the $250 million of dispositions, they would blend out to be around 9, and that\u2019s a function of one of them being in a B mall and in the low to mid 7s and the others being C malls. And they\u2019re more double digit type of cap rates.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then in looking at your same-store NOI, there\u2019s a big chunk of sort of EBITDA from non-comparable centers. Can you remind us what\u2019s in that non-comparable bucket and what center should potentially be added to the same-store pool in 2014?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes the non-comp, Christy, would include things like fashion outlets of Chicago, any asset that wasn\u2019t in both periods for the full period. So FOC would not be in there, Green Acres would not be in there. Those are two of the bigger assets. And then anything, obviously that was disposed of during the year would come out of both periods for that calculation as well.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","And what enters the pool next quarter? Just Green Acres?","Tom O\u2019Hern","What new goes in next quarter? I don\u2019t know that there\u2019ll be anything new going in next quarter.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","FOC will not go in until the fourth quarter, Green Acres will go in starting in the second quarter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new that will go in, in the first quarter.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","And then did you disclose your growth in your sales per square foot, the year-over-year growth on same \u2013 enter basis?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, as luck would have it, I\u2019m sure you can ascertain that from the supplement. I think if you look at the pages that breakout the sales per foot, page 14 would give you the portfolio totals there, 562 versus 541, I think it\u2019s roughly 3.9%. And you have one asset there, Christy, Paradise Valley that went into redevelopment that\u2019s not included. If that were pulled out, it would be about 3%.","Christy McElroy \u2013 Citi","Okay, got you. Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes. Hi, guys. Just going back to dispositions for a second. I know that it sounds like you\u2019re pretty settled at 250 and would tie future dispositions more specific to some investment activity, but I\u2019m just curious how many assets you\u2019re actually marketing to get to the four to five, and if the demand proves out to be better than you expect, would you consider just selling more?","Art Coppola","No, we would not like consider selling more. And anything that is in our guidance is already in the market and may even be under contract, various stages of conversations. But there may be one other joint venture asset, a joint venture partner. It\u2019s not that big, may ask us to market in the middle part of the year.","But anything that is in the band of the $225 to $275, they\u2019ve already been identified and they\u2019re either under contract already, or they\u2019re very close to being under contract. It\u2019s an identified pool of assets.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you. And I\u2019ll just switch on the development side, how much you guys expect to spend this year under your own pipeline [ph]?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. It will probably between $200 and $300 in total including everything, pipeline projects, shallow pipeline projects and then miscellaneous projects that are smaller than that and not listed on the schedule.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just one last question, just \u2013 in terms of just the sales environment which you addressed pretty necessarily [ph], there does seem to be some mismatch between sort of what the companies were expecting sell versus what they did, whether it\u2019s weather or otherwise any other reasons, given the amount of preannouncements we\u2019ve heard from folks, I\u2019m just curious if you think first quarter I can see that typically there\u2019s a bit, I mean, do you think it will be \u2013 it will be worse than it\u2019s been in the past two years?","Art Coppola","Are you talking about retail sales? Are you talking about that [ph] when you say preannouncements?","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well, retailers pre-announcing negatively and seemingly a little bit surprise by the sale environment.","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t see that impacting our occupancy at all.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Art Coppola","I mean, these folks don\u2019t make decisions to sign new leases based upon last weeks or last months or last quarters\u2019 sales or even what they think next week or next month\u2019s sales are going to be and likewise they\u2019re all generally on long-term leases and they don\u2019t have the option of leaving if they had a bad month.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","No, no, no, it was more a question about profitability maybe being down worse than expected and possibly leading to some additional closures and that kind of thing, maybe not even from the public guys but form the guys that the other players out there. But yes, it sounds like you\u2019re not really expecting any significant difference from the past few years.","Art Coppola","No, I\u2019m not. And this is going to be a joke. It\u2019s my understanding though that their profitability is up because of how well they\u2019re doing online.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Art Coppola","That\u2019s was a joke, an attempt. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning out there.","Art Coppola","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey, I trust Santa Monica is a warm 80 degrees or so or are you guys having a chill as well?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, down to 75 today.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And the violins are out. First opt, Art, if you take a look at your portfolio, the top malls clearly were driving the sales growth, and the bottom \u2013 the top 10 were \u2013 the bottom 44 were basically flat. So you talked about as you went through the portfolio and called the bottom third of tenants and replace those that it would certainly enhance the mall growth. What should we expect? Should we expect that the top 10 malls are going to continue to deliver growth and the bottom \u2013 the bottom 40 are just going to be as is or do you envision a way to sort of accelerate the growth? Basically is it easier to call \u2013 how easy is it to call the bottom third of the tenants at the bottom 40 malls versus at the top 10?","Art Coppola","Okay. Well, thank you. That\u2019s a good question. I appreciate it. If I take a look at \u2013 so I\u2019m going to take out the top 10 centers, they\u2019re not in the pool anymore. I\u2019m going to take out the bottom 10 centers, they\u2019re not in the pool anymore. And I just go from 11 through 40. So from the 11th best center that we have to the 40th best center, so that\u2019s a pool of 30 malls. Those malls average $525 a square foot. And centers that are doing $525 a square foot that are of a nature such as Kings Plaza, Burberry [ph], you can go through any part of the list from 11 through 40 and we have the demand for space in those centers.","So I can\u2019t predict what sales are going to be in these centers. I know that a lot of these centers were going up against tough years, last year, sales increases were relatively decent in 2012 fairly much across the Board. But I can tell you that leasing demand in each of these categories has been very good and that we have had positive releasing spreads in every category.","And then again, as I mentioned when you slice and dice that a little bit more and you go into any one of these centers and you take out the bottom third of the tenants and think about the \u2013 what the top two-thirds are doing, that\u2019s more than the stated number. And these centers we\u2019ve got very strong demand, we\u2019ve got good occupancy. The occupancies are sitting right there in the supplement for the \u2013 basically for themselves. And I anticipate continuing to have good demand in these centers.","The other thing and this is a nuance [ph], and I\u2019m going to consider talking about it or disclosing it is that sometimes these numbers in here are anomalies because they\u2019re comp sale tenants. So you can have new tenants that come in and they\u2019ve only been there for six months and they\u2019re tearing the cover off the ball, they don\u2019t show up in any of our comp sales for almost 18 months to two years.","So when I look at our comp sales and then I look at our total center sales for our mall tenants, a lot of times it\u2019s \u2013 well, it\u2019s almost always two different numbers. And the total sales are always much more positive than the comp sales. And that\u2019s strictly a logistical reporting system that we have. And I\u2019m going to consider beginning to talk about that because the comp sales that you see in these schedules and likely that you may see at other companies too, they\u2019re very trailing in terms of picking up new tenants that we\u2019re adding. And the new tenants that we add generally are doing a lot more than the tenants that we replaced.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Right. But presumably the same impact to all the malls. So at the end of the day you still have the top centers that are driving the growth whereas the bottom \u2013 the other 40 \u2013","Art Coppola","\u2013 you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","The second question is, the assets \u2013 the four to five that you have that you\u2019re marketing what was the comp sales for those assets?","Art Coppola","Flat to down a little bit.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. So from the \u2013 Okay, so from \u2013","Art Coppola","Probably flat [ph].","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. If we look at one of your peers today, it\u2019s obviously getting hurt because of their blockbuster sales productivity. Do you think at some point buyers of B malls do start give a flat sales, somebody\u2019s malls starts to impact their appeal or their view is that they can provide more attention, more focus and therefore it\u2019s sort of a relevant what the current sales trend are at the B malls that they\u2019re looking to buy?","Art Coppola","I think it\u2019s irrelevant. I think that there\u2019s couple of groups of B mall buyers, there\u2019s the private buying groups and that\u2019s a substantial group. Honestly they could care less about sales growth from what I can see. They don\u2019t look at numbers like that. They look at what can my levered return be and what kind of remerchandising can I do. And a lot of the B mall buyers are do have expertise in the big box arena, and they\u2019re able to think about things a little bit differently, and think about the opportunities that can be created adding some non-traditional to a mall owner, big boxes to a B mall center. But I have not \u2013 I have not seen one buyer of any center that we have sold get preoccupied with the sales growth one way or another.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Nathan Isbee from Stifel.","Nathan Isbee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Art Coppola","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan Isbee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Art, from your perspective you elaborated on the whole e-commerce issue. I\u2019m just curious how you see the Omni channel [ph] retailing will impact the outlet-only retailers not those that have both full price and half price strategies?","Art Coppola","I\u2019d have to go through and do a survey of how many outlet-only tenants there are, I mean, those are more just the pure manufacturers. And I\u2019m sure they have online distribution channels also. But the vast majority of the retailers that we have been exposed to that are in the outlet centers that we\u2019re involved with or that we would seek to be involved with are pure Omni channel [ph] retailers that are in all I\u2019ll say four channels, full-price, half-price, online, and social media.","Nathan Isbee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then on Tysons development, as the leasing their progresses it gets closer to opening. Can you just talk a little bit more in more detail what impact that we\u2019ll have on the retail? How much growth, incremental growth you think you could drive from the mall there?","Art Coppola","Sure. We expect that the three towers when they\u2019re open will bring between 3,000 and 5,000 people per day to Tysons Corner that are not there today. And our experience is that when you \u2013 the closest analogy that I have to bringing 3,000 people a day to a site that formally were not there would be when we added a theatre to Tysons Corner, and it\u2019s one of the most successful theatres in United States, the AMC there.","And when we added that, we have brought tremendous new traffic and sales per foot in the center [ph] went up about $150 a foot. Probably the more \u2013 when you have a center that\u2019s already doing $700, $800 a square foot and doing almost $1 billion, honestly doesn\u2019t matter necessarily. If the center goes up $100 a foot, I doubt it. But I do know and Bobby may want to elaborate on it, that even before the densification is open for business and even before the rail is open for business, the retailers have begun to pick up on the dramatic change that they expect as a consequence of the densification. Do you want to talk to that Bob?","Bobby Perlmutter","Sure. Obviously Tysons is one of the most productive centers and most important locations for retailers in the Washington D.C. market. So demand for space is always strong at the center. Probably the most important addition from the mix use development that we\u2019re seeing is greater demand from retailers to do these flagship stores. We have two tenants who are signed and underway for flagship stores right at the entry and there\u2019s two more that we\u2019re working on.","So probably the biggest new ones that we\u2019re seeing at Tysons is the demand for retailers to put in-stores that are more than their average stores but are really flagship stores. And interestingly willing to step up and pay the rents required to accommodate those stores.","So it used to be that the larger tenants would seek lower rents and the opposite is really happening [ph] at Tysons. In addition we\u2019re adding to the food venue with the mix use and obviously the additional traffic. So it\u2019s a very logical next step when you look at the location within the center. It\u2019s really have spaces that are coming due over the next couple of years. So it gives us the chance to really generate above average growth at the asset in the near-term.","Nathan Isbee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","All right, thank you. And then just finally at Santa Monica aside from the new theater deal, any other changes coming down the pike at that asset [ph]?","Bobby Perlmutter","Santa Monica, probably the theater is clearly the most important element, as well as the rail, which is coming to the property and the surrounding peripheral development which continues to get stronger. What we\u2019re seeing at Santa Monica is the luxury and designer tenants have very, very strong performance on the ground floor. So we\u2019re actually going through and adding additional designer in luxury brands to the ground floor, already replacing tenants that are good tenants but not necessarily doing the productivity needed on the ground floor. So we\u2019re sort of settling those tenants in on the second floor.","So you\u2019re going to see the ground floor luxury and brands further develop. The traditional mall and better specialty starts to be on the second level and the theatre will not only support the existing restaurant at third floor but allow us to bring in additional restaurants. And continue to make a destination which as we look to distinguish ourselves from other retail venues, clearly the entertainment, restaurants, outdoor environment are very important.","Nathan Isbee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","All right, Thanks.","Art Coppola","All right, thank you. I know we\u2019ve still have several folks in the queue. So I would request maybe that you try and limit your question to one question, maybe two if you need to and I\u2019ll try and keep my answers a little shorter. Next question.","Operator","And that will come from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning, just one quick question. I mean, everything we have kind of seen out of the portfolio in all your plans, everything just seems to be good and really, really well right now. Just curious one or two things that you\u2019re may be concerned about over the next 6 to 12 months?","Art Coppola","Taxes.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Okay.","Art Coppola","No, actually I\u2019m joking a little bit, I\u2019m not joking, I mean, taxes are real right? So when we think about the retail sales in 2013 across the Board and you look at the incremental Federal Income Tax bracket that the world got exposed to, add to that the California Income Tax increases that got hit on the people out here, and the tax bite is pretty significant.","So that is kind of an issue. I guess the biggest thing that concerns me is that I think retail landlords are being more negatively than they deserve to be for an issue that I thought we had put to bed 15 years ago. And that\u2019s the interrelationship of online shopping and brick-and-mortar shopping, but you know what? Over the next six months we\u2019re going to address that as an industry.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you. Thanks, Tayo.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Daniel Busch from Green Street Advisors.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just going back to some of your comment on the two-thirds of the top tenants and the bottom one-third, when I look at the top 10 centers and think about the 8% sales productivity growth, do you have an idea on how much of that is true same store growth by those two-thirds? And then how much is from \u2013 moving from a lower productivity tenant and bringing in a higher productivity tenant?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t have an exactly number for you but intuitively I know that the good get better and the average get worst. So typically the ones \u2013 the tenants that are producing, they continue to produce. And the ones that just have missed the market \u2013 they might be a good tenant but they may just be on the wrong \u2013 may not be right for that market. And so, that could be the reason that they\u2019re not performing. They tend to just kind of drag it down. And that\u2019s why when it come \u2013 when the opportunity presents itself you recycle them with somebody that\u2019s more appropriate.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. It helps.","Art Coppola","It is an interesting way to slice and dice these numbers, I mean, I\u2019ve started doing it a couple of months ago because we intuitively said, look why aren\u2019t we interested of renewing two-thirds of the tenants anyway, the top two-thirds. So what\u2019s the occupancy cost and what\u2019s the sales productivity in those guys.","When we look through it, we look at just our top 20 centers, and it took our sales up by 40% and take our average cost of occupancy for the guys that would renew anyway [ph], from 13.5% to 10%. And it just further validated that hey, we still got plenty of runway here for growth. And the real challenge is to make sure that you have good replacement tenants for the guys that you know or don\u2019t belong there anymore, weather their concept [ph] is dead or maybe they\u2019re in the wrong location, maybe they over expanded, maybe they\u2019re in the wrong sector, any number of different things.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","And along those lines, so when you slice it like that going forward, would you expect \u2013 would you expect more \u2013 the most of your re-leasing spread growth to come from the signing new leases with these underperformers going or away as opposed to the renewals from your better tenants?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s both. I mean, the renewals are strong is my point because those tenants when you really look at them, their cost of occupancy isn\u2019t the mall cost of occupancy it\u2019s less because they\u2019re outperforming the mall. And so, they can afford to pay more. They don\u2019t love to pay more but they can and they do. I think it\u2019s both, it\u2019s both.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Daniel Busch \u2013 Green Street Advisors","No, thanks Ed.","Operator","Our next question is from Linda Tsai from Barclays.","Linda Tsai \u2013 Barclays","Good afternoon. I\u2019m looking at your sales per square foot property ranking, and for the lowest group, group five is a nominal contributor of NOI, but it looks like it\u2019s the only group that saw a decline on occupancy at the end of 2013 versus the prior year. I\u2019m just wondering what do you attribute this to? Is this a timing issue or is it reflective with leasing efforts because it\u2019s not a big NOI contributor? Or do you think it says something about the consumer macro challenges facing these lower productivity malls?","Art Coppola","I think it\u2019s a function but maybe of all of the above, but most importantly it\u2019s a function that when leases roll over in centers like this sometimes they\u2019re not able to renew the leases with existing tenants because retailers attended to try concentrate their efforts on the A and the B mall locations of the world and kind of gravitate away from the lower productivity locations.","Linda Tsai \u2013 Barclays","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll take another question from Ki Bin Kim from Sun Trust.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","Thank you. So I think the most interesting things that today was \u2013 that two-thirds of the retailers on top 20 centers [ph] sales are up 40% which \u2013","Art Coppola","No, I said their sales are \u2013 wait a minute, I said, if you look at the top two-thirds of the tenants in our top 20 centers, their sales per foot are 40% more than the sales per foot that we published for the entire mall. That\u2019s what I said.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","Okay. Got it. Okay. That makes much more sense.","Art Coppola","Yes. Yes. Yes. I could see where that would be confusing.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","Okay. Maybe along the similar lines, which types of tenants are actually putting up from a apples-to-apples stand point much stronger same store sales growth than kind of your average portfolio tenant? And tie to that are you doing any kind of reverse inquiries into online retailers like I think it\u2019s Brandy Melville that you have in Santa Monica place that are really highly successful and maybe trying to have them expand more into brick-and-mortar?","Art Coppola","Sure. Bobby Perlmutter, you want to \u2013","Bobby Perlmutter","Sure. This is Bobby Perlmutter. Brandy Melville we actually opened in Corte Madera, but it\u2019s a great example of that. In terms of categories that performed the best in 2013, probably the two best categories were home furnishings and jewelry. Jewelry had a very, very strong year after going through some fairly significant consolidation.","The third bucket that really does well is really brand specific. And those are retailers that understand their customer and are doing a good job selling their product and differentiating their product in marketing to their customer. And you see some promoter names like lululemon and Michael Kors in particular, Kate Spade. But we also see names like Victoria\u2019s Secret having very, very good success with Pink [ph] in extending \u2013 expanding their store base. So in terms of categories I would probably identify jewelry and home furnishing, and beyond that it\u2019s more brand specific as supposed to category.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","And the part on Brandy Melville, sorry for taking a little more time.","Art Coppola","I\u2019m sorry, what was the question about Brandy Melville in terms of will they expand?","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","Well, I mean, have you guys started targeting more proactively a very successful online retailers or having them maybe try out store concepts they haven\u2019t pursued in the past?","Bobby Perlmutter","Yes. I mean, again, those retailers I\u2019m thinking about it, I think earlier it was mentioned Microsoft is an example of someone who is moving. Athleta has been very aggressive starting as an online retailer, Gap has other concept, Piperlime that they\u2019re looking at. So more \u2013","Art Coppola","[Inaudible].","Bobby Perlmutter","Yes.","Art Coppola","Is it Warby Parker, the eyewear person, they swore they would never open a brick-and-mortar store --","Bobby Perlmutter","And then we\u2019ll close with them.","Art Coppola","Now, they\u2019re going to be opening.","Bobby Perlmutter","Yes. Yes. So we think you\u2019re going to see more of that. [inaudible] Bosh and properties and other [ph] group that we\u2019ve been able to do a couple of deals with that are new to the Brick and mortar [ph].","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Michael Mueller from JP Morgan.","Art Coppola","Hey, Michael.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Yes, hi. Hey, Art, I know this is exactly what you said, but going back to the idea that the bottom third of tenants could cycle out over time. If we\u2019re thinking about the normal $500, $550 a foot mall, how big is the pool of tenants that usually draw from or draw from for a mall?","So for example if you have 100, 200 tenants in there, how big is the pool that that draws from, is it 400 deep, 300 deep, 500 deep?","Bobby Perlmutter","Well, this is not, a lot depends on the particular market. Sort of example, in our portfolio we have two centers, one in Fresno and one in the modesto that are sort of in that range but have a very large paid area because there\u2019s no alternatives in that market.","So even though they are larger and productive centers, they\u2019re truly the only game in town. Other markets can be more fragmented or more deeply developed that the trade becomes more limited or more specialized in, in terms of who they\u2019re drawing. So a lot depends on the competitive situation.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. But not talking about the shoppers coming in, if we are just thinking about the pool of tenants [ph]? That\u2019s what \u2013","Bobby Perlmutter","Well, yes, they\u2019re sort of related though.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","How come?","Bobby Perlmutter","I mean, depending on what shoppers we\u2019re pulling and how many will also dictate how deep the tenant demand is and if the tenants don\u2019t have alternative locations within the market and Queens is the classic example, one of reason we\u2019re able to drive very high rents and very high occupancy cost at Queens well in excess of the portfolio average is not always a productivity which is the measure that most people look at but a retailer has very few alternatives to cover the market, they\u2019re not in Queens.","Art Coppola","In good centers the pool of tenant is virtually unlimited and that is proven out. You take a look at our occupancies which we published by center and you\u2019re going to see numbers above 90% for virtually every center that we have until you get down into the bottom 10 or 12 centers that we own. What can happen and this particularly can happen in tend to be more the B malls is that as you\u2019re cycling out of \u2013 maybe a B mall was built to be too big.","And so, you got the unproductive tenants. And maybe the pool in that town, maybe it\u2019s a smaller town has gotten to the point to where you have to think about other uses [ph] and that\u2019s kind of what I was saying earlier is that I found that some of the B mall buyers have been really successful at introducing junior anchors into these malls that will pay decent rents and generate a lot of traffic. And we have begun to do that ourselves, so people like TJ Maxx, Marshalls and [ph] folks like that that take up a lot of space that home goods, TJ Max Home Goods [ph] that we didn\u2019t use to leased space to in the malls, usually in the B malls, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll take. And as we assimilate a group of unproductive tenants we\u2019ll accumulate a block of space and re-merchandize it with the junior anchor [ph].","So the occupancies are all there to read by property. But if it\u2019s a good property, it\u2019s relatively unlimited. The only thing that I would say is that over time you constantly have to re-imagine what you are doing in the way of a use. So the theatre that we\u2019re adding to cerritos for example, part of the space that the theatre is going to occupy is an old Nordstrom store that was functionally obsolete that we replace as well as some mall shops that we always historically had trouble leasing, we\u2019ll demolish all that, create a new Megaplex [ph] theatre and it will become a new anchor for the center. So you are introducing new uses. So the new uses really begin to \u2013 the number and the opportunities are unlimited.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And just one other quick one, is Estrella close to kicking off?","Art Coppola","No.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay.","Art Coppola","We\u2019ll kick it off when it\u2019s ready.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick ones, first circling back to Tysons Art, I think you mentioned that preleasing for the office remain at 70% at the end of the year. I was just wondering what the leasing pipeline is like for the remaining space and maybe where you think you\u2019ll be at opening? And I\u2019m sort of curious about learners office development across the road there, any concern that it will be a little bit more difficult to get the remainder of that space in your tower leased?","Art Coppola","No, no, no. We\u2019re very far long in the negotiations. We\u2019re basically leasing four floors right now. We have one tenant that is either going to take two or three of the remaining six floors. We got another guy that is going to take one of the remaining six floors. So I fully anticipate that we\u2019ll be way over 80% least on the opening.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last question on investment, I know you mentioned that guidance doesn\u2019t include any acquisitions and there certainly been a lot of focus on this dispositions, but I was just curious if you could maybe talk about the pipeline today for investments if there\u2019s anything out there that you\u2019re looking at and maybe any opportunities to buyout joint venture partners in \u201814?","Art Coppola","No, I really \u2013 we have no guidance on any new acquisitions or buyout to partners for 2014. We find that at this point in time these assets are so precious the ones that we want to own, I mean, look right now there\u2019s probably 50 malls on the market and we got four or five of them on there, but they\u2019re not malls that we want to buy. We made a conscious decision that we want to focus on fewer, bigger assets in the select dense markets that we know really well. And we find that that portfolio has got a huge reinvestment opportunity.","So when I think about the Sears stores or the Penny's Stores and I\u2019m not throwing either one of them under the bus because the rest of the world already did that for all of us. And if I\u2019m going to make the assumption that one or either of them are going to either shrink or something else [ph] or consolidate or something else happen, that creates massive opportunities for expansion within our existing portfolio.","I mean, there are cases here where Sears may own a 20 acre parcel of land and a 300,000 foot building at Washington Square in Portland, Oregon for example. I mean, that\u2019s an unbelievable opportunity for reinvestment.","So we can\u2019t find anywhere better frankly than our existing portfolio to put our money. Should an opportunity arise, we\u2019ve always been opportunistically there to acquire. We are very fortunate to be able to buy Kings and Green Acres 15 months ago. And we\u2019ve had great success with the centers that we have acquired but they\u2019re really precious and they\u2019re generally in very strong hands and I don\u2019t expect them to become of the market.","So on a risk adjusted basis, I can\u2019t think of anywhere that is safer and more profitable than plowing money into proven winning locations like Tysons Corner, Broadway Plaza, Walnut Creek, the expansion of Chicago, the expansion of Scottsdale Fashion Square, the expansion of Cerritos, look at our pipeline the addition of a theatre to Santa Monica place, they\u2019re just isn\u2019t a better smarter place for us to put our money on a risk adjusted basis.","Todd Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Okay, great. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take a question from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, we already kind of touch on this, but would you say the interest of your malls that you plan to sell this year is in fact coming from private buyers?","Art Coppola","Those are the majority of the buyers, yes, but the major thing I would say is that the buying pool in general and I\u2019m not talking about necessarily the properties that we\u2019re looking at right now because we drop down with the exceptional one property in terms of quality level, probably closer to the C category. So it is a different pool of buyers. But as I think about the type of assets that we sold last year, the buying \u2013 number of buyers is greater today than it was a year ago, and their appetite seems to be greater today than it was a year ago. And I think that\u2019s really just a function of the fact that they found out and figure it out that they can do really well with this.","Caitlin Burrows \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then I guess that sounds like \u2013","Art Coppola","No, go ahead.","Caitlin Burrows \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was going to say that the pool for those C properties then it\u2019s probably not nearly as large [ph]?","Art Coppola","No, I didn\u2019t say that, I said, it\u2019s a different pool. And no, it\u2019s not as deep as big as well funded \u2013 it\u2019s a different pool. It\u2019s a different pool, but there\u2019s plenty of capital out there.","Caitlin Burrows \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today, Mr. Art Coppola, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to you for additional or closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Okay.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Macerich Company First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.","Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue for questions. I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Hi. Thank you everyone for joining us today on our first quarter 2013 earnings call. We look forward to see many of you Tuesday afternoon June 4th, in Chicago for our Construction Tour of fashion outlets of Chicago, as well the tour of The Shops at North Bridge on Michigan Avenue. Please contact me for the details.","During the course of this call management will be looking \u2013 will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","This call will be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that the passage of time can render information stale, and you should not rely on the continued accuracy of this material.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Director; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you for joining us today. First, I\u2019d like to introduce John Perry, our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. We\u2019re very pleased to welcome John to our management team in this newly created position to withstand investor relations efforts. We\u2019ve known John for many years at Deutsche Bank and we know he is going to be a great addition to our team.","As most of you noticed, we added a new disclosure in the supplement today. The development pipeline on page 30 of the supplement. Mark will elaborate on this pipeline later in the call. Today, we are going to keep our introductory comments brief. We will have plenty of time for Q&A. That being said we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean Wood.","On the operating metrics, we continued to see strong fundamentals in our business, leasing volumes and spreads were both good. We signed leases for 325,000 square feet during the quarter with an average releasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of about 15% \u2013 14.9%. Occupancy rose nicely from a year ago at 93.4% that compared to 92.1% at March 31, 2012.","Adjusted FFO was up 13% in the quarter to $0.86 compared to $0.76 a year ago. Same center NOI increased by 3.4% compared to the first quarter of last year. And it\u2019s important to note on that statistic that it does not include straight-lining or lease termination revenue.","This increase in same-store NOI growth was driven by increased occupancy, positive re-leasing spreads in 2012 that are now rolling through our 2013 numbers and the CPI increases on our leases. This is above our guidance range of 275 between a quarter, but this is just one quarter. So we\u2019re not ready to modify that guidance yet but we\u2019ll readdress that guidance after the second quarter.","We had gain on land sales during the quarter of $2.2 million. Those were sales that we had anticipated and they were included in our previously issued earnings guidance. There was significant savings on interest expense during the quarter as our average interest rate went down to 4.1%, compared to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2012.","Over the past 12 months, we have made significant progress on our balance sheet. Our debt to market cap at quarter end was down to 42.6%. Our floating rate debt had been reduced to 23%, compared to 36% a year ago. Our average debt maturity duration has increased to almost 5.5 years compared to 3.4 years a year ago.","We continued to take advantage of this great financing market. During the past 12 months, we have completed over 2.6 billion of financings, that\u2019s our pro rata share. The average term of those financings has been 8.3 years and the average interest rate 3.4%. These low interest rates that we have been locking in have had a significant positive impact on our cash flow.","Our interest coverage ratio, for example, has improved to 2.9 times, compared to 2.5 times a year ago. There is only about $480 million remaining in maturities for 2013 and there we have two big loans coming up, one FlatIron Crossing with an interest rate of 5.32 and the other is Tysons Corner Mall with an interest of 5.22. Both are very underleveraged with interest rates and placed significantly above where we could finance today. Going forward, we will continue to put long-term non-recourse financing in place and continue to stretch out our maturity schedule.","In this morning\u2019s press release \u2013 last night\u2019s press release, we gave guidance \u2013 updated guidance on FFO. We increased our previously issued estimate by $0.03 at both bottom and top end of the range with a new range being $3.35 and $3.45. The increase in guidance is due to the strong first quarter performance including occupancy gains, rental and recovery growth and other operational efficiencies. We\u2019ve also encountered a better interest rate environment and loan environment than when we did our initial 2013 forecast.","The guidance range includes an assumption of $500 million to $1 billion of dispositions during 2013, that has not changed from our original guidance. As part of that assumption, we also assume a mid-year execution of those dispositions on average and average cap rate is 7.5%. Art will be discussing dispositions in more detail shortly.","As I mentioned, and again we are not going to modify at this time our same center NOI growth assumption, but we\u2019ll revisit that at the end of the second quarter. And the revised guidance quarterly split for the remainder of the year would be, of the total FFO 23% will come from the second quarter, 23% from the third quarter and 29% from the fourth quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Tom. First of all, I\u2019m going to talk about our dispositions recycling program, then I\u2019ll talk about our development to both underway as well as our shadow pipeline as outlined in our supplemental. And then, I want to talk a little bit about our same center NOI growth and the prospects for the immediate future.","On the topic of dispositions, I\u2019d like to first of all revisit the why behind our recycling program. The disposition of recycling program was really driven by our observation that as a result of the acquisitions of Kings Plaza and Green Acres, that we were able to do a tax advantaged reverse 10\/31 exchange and take 14 assets and essentially allocate the high basis, the new basis of the two centers that we have bought into 14 older centers, which therefore would make them tax efficient for disposition.","Secondly, one of the drivers behind the decision to expose a number of properties to the market and we exposed a larger number than we thought would be purchased because we had no idea who the \u2013 what properties the buyers would be interested in. A second major driver of that decision was to reload our balance sheet after the $1.7 billion of acquisitions.","As you remember those acquisitions were funded using property level or other corporate level debt of $1.2 billion, which is a naturally high amount and we knew that it was temporary. We decided to reload the balance sheet through dispositions.","Another driver of the decision to go through the recycling was to essentially think about this as recycling capital from older, slower growth assets into Class A higher growth assets such as Tysons and Fashion Outlets of Chicago and the others outlined in our supplemental in the shadow of pipeline.","Another driver was our decision to prune our portfolio to increase our brand value. So that when retailers think about us, they are really thinking about the best centers in the U.S. and an extremely high quality pure portfolio. We wanted to prune the portfolio also because we had observed and it was intuitive as well as actual but over the last 10 years if we look at it, we look at our lower productivity centers versus our higher productivity centers.","The better centers produce better NOI growth, the bigger centers produce better NOI growth than the smaller centers. The smaller centers are very stable, but they just don\u2019t have the same dynamic qualities that a real powerhouse has.","And finally the decision to recycle capital out of these lower sales productivity and non-core geographic locations was to heighten our focus of our management team on fewer bigger assets, we did not want to dilute our focus and our attention.","Now I\u2019d like to report to you how the disposition and recycling program has been going. We started the process in December with early teasers through brokers and we exposed the properties through a number of buyers and we got a significant amount of interest and we\u2019re pleased with the progress and the status of the disposition.","Having said that, while I\u2019m willing entertain questions about the disposition program, please respect the fact that we are in highly sensitive negotiations with various buyers. Some of the deals, the buyers have money at risk, that\u2019s not so sensitive. In some of the deals, the buyers were under contract and if essentially a free look during the due diligence period and other deals were still in either a first or second round of bidding.","So talking about the size of the disposition and recycling program and the status of it to some degree could comprise on negotiations. So if we get into sensitive territory, please respect the fact that I may say look I can\u2019t answer that question. Interest has been strong. We\u2019ve probably received bids from at least 10 groups on a selection of 14 assets. We also marketed three assets in the Seattle area and two retail assets and an office complex received numerous bids. The bids came from a combination of private equity folks, large private equity loan folks as well as some public companies.","At this point in time, I\u2019m pleased to report to you that our current guidance remains $500 million of dispositions for the year to a $1 billion. We are on track and on target with that. I feel extremely comfortable with the low end of the range. We feel very solid at that end of the range.","And that\u2019s not to mean that we\u2019re not going to hit the high end of the range, but really to get into great detail about specific dollar amounts at this point in time would really comprise our overall program. So our guidance remains basically what we gave you three months ago, but our execution is really in very good shape.","If you think about it, the process of, first of all packaging up the tax attributes that needed to be handled to make these properties ready for sale. And then the process of marketing and going through multiple bids and now to actually be in contract on numbers of assets and actually be hard on assets. That\u2019s really good progress on a matter of four or five months. So I am pleased with where we are there and we\u2019re going to accomplish the purposes that we sought to accomplish.","Turning to the development pipeline, as Tom noted, there is obviously the new supplemental that we have there. Chicago, we will look forward to having a hard-hat tour with those of you that who want to join us in June at NAREE, we look forward to the grand opening in August. We\u2019re extremely proud and pleased. Retailers are \u2013 have very high expectations and we also have very expectations. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity.","One of my board member said so, how many more of these are we going to do and I said, well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019re too many other sites right next to one of the busiest airports in the world that you\u2019re able to get this kind of tenant mix on.","So, it\u2019s one-of-a-kind but we\u2019re happy to have had the opportunity to get involved to this point and we think it\u2019s going to establish our presence in the outlet industry not as being big in terms of size or quantity by any stretch but certainly being productive on those that we own which is consistent with the strategy that we outlined for you couple of years ago when we said that we are going to move into this arena.","Looking at our Tysons development, very pleased to be able to deliver on our prognosis for you that we gave you on our last call that we anticipated signing a second anchor tenant in the office complex we\u2019re pouring I think about a floor, a week in that office building, I think we\u2019re up to the fourth floor above grade now. So that\u2019s coming along great. Leasing activity is very strong there.","Let\u2019s remember that Tysons is a one-of-a-kind property. So when you look at the DC market overall and you look at the different components of office or residential on a macro level, sure they\u2019ve got headwinds, but Tysons is a universe to itself. You look at the combination of the intersection of Tysons One and the Tysons Galleria and put the Metrorail in between the two of them.","Add to that the HOT Lanes that have now been open both to the North and the South on the beltway which has cut the good news for shoppers and employees by half, taken a 45 minute commute and reduced it to 15 or 20 minutes and this is just a one-of-a-kind location. You\u2019ve got almost 3 million feet of Class A retail at one intersection. I\u2019m pleased to see that the Metrorail is just in the process of awarding in excess of a multi-billion dollar contract to extend the rail from Tysons Corner to Dallas.","So now we\u2019ll have the rail going all the away from Dallas with primary stop at Tysons Corner to Downtown. We\u2019re seeing synergies between the five elements that we have here on our densification. The office users for example both Intelsat which by the way just went public it\u2019s for those of you that might want to know more about who that is, obviously it\u2019s a household term.","Both Intelsat and the Lloyd\u2019s HR departments have already started talking to our residential f developer Kettler about getting pre-reservations for residential units for their employees. When you add the number of employees that are going to be there in our office building to the number of employees that are in the immediate trade area, then I think 170,000 office workers in the immediate trade area.","It\u2019s a very natural thought that those employees would want to have a live, work, play, pedestrian environment young, old and professional has to travel a lot. They could live without a car. Why wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s a great new urban paradigm in what was originally obviously a suburban environment.","So, the residential, we anticipate notwithstanding the macro noise that you hear in the market that our residential building is clearly the Class A building in the market. You don\u2019t have any other buildings in the entire market and certainly looking at Tysons that has the amenity package that we have, that has the access to mass transit that we have both by car with the HOT Lanes as well as rail that takes into the airport as well as Downtown.","That has the shopping, the dining, the entertainment and the choices that you have. So we\u2019re very bullish and comfortable on the residential component here. The hotel operator that we have, Hyatt Regency, they\u2019re extremely excited. They operate a hotel over at Ruston. And they look at the plaza that we\u2019re creating, which is almost 2 acres compared to the public space that they have at this other project, which is 10% of that in size. And they are so enthused about the opportunities for special events, weddings, banquets and other events that they can host there.","They see the fact that the plaza is the key glue, that ties the office, the residential, the hotel and the retail together. We\u2019re seeing synergies in the retail. Leasing is really beginning to take on a new view with the retailers now taking space that formally was viewed as very good space, which is essentially the new entrance area, that connects to the plaza. And they now see that as the 50 yard lines, very enthused about that.","Moving to Fashion Outlets of Niagara, we have internally green light of that project where over 50% pre-leased in terms of handshakes and commitments. I\u2019m not going to get into details on how many leases are signed, because at this point in time, you are not at that point, but we\u2019re green lighting it from the viewpoint of moving forward with an anticipation that we open that project in late 2014, early 2015. We are anticipating at least 10% stabilized return on our investment there.","Other projects that are in our development shadow pipeline that we are obviously very enthused about. King\u2019s Plaza, Kings you will see in the supplemental now is doing $700 of square foot. Sales were up 9.4%, comp sales for the first quarter of this year. Green Acres, sales were up 7% for the first quarter of this year.","So Kings, we have had development teams working there almost on a weekly basis and we are very, very bullish on what we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish within that center and the timeframes that we anticipate for that are indicated. The expenditures that we have outlined of \u2013 this is a very broad range in the shadow pipeline and that\u2019s why it\u2019s in the shadow pipeline and the hard pipeline is $75 million to $100 million. We anticipate very good double digit returns there.","We\u2019re looking to make a remerchandising maybe on the food court most likely. And this does not involve recapturing any anchor space or recycling any big boxes within the center. This is really essentially doing what we do best which is simply remerchandising and refreshing and repositioning centers. As you know, Brooklyn is on fire.","You can barely go a week without picking up a magazine or newspaper article. I read in LA just last Sunday, was talking about how Brooklyn is now the hippest spot in the U.S. And this is \u2013 we\u2019re very pleased with that.","Green Acres, we are pleased to let you know that we closed a couple of weeks ago on the acquisition of 20 acres of contiguous land right off of the Sunrise Highway. So it\u2019s exactly contiguous to the center. So the opportunity to buy 20 acres of land for about $20 million exactly contiguous to a center that is doing over $800 million in total sales. We\u2019re very pleased with that. And we have \u2013 we\u2019re putting together our thoughts with demand sourcing right now. From retailers, we got lots of demand from big boxes as well as anchor tenants that want to either come in or reposition or expand.","I now want to talk briefly about same center NOI growth and our outlook. First of all, I want to say that on the same-store NOI growth that I do want to observe that in the same way that I observed that simply putting at number of sales per square foot was only two dimensional.","And it didn\u2019t add a third dimension of adding the quality of the sales per foot and adding the NOI associated with the properties. But I think that the \u2013 the focus of same center NOI \u2013 what we get it that same center NOI is going to be a key driver for our share performance and for anybody\u2019s share performance, especially when share prices were getting lofty. But I do have to remind you that one has to be careful in the operation of the regional shopping center, not to be shortsighted in leasing.","If you can chase same center NOI at the expense of long-term value creation. So we do keep that in mind. I will take responsibility for the fact that going back to January of 2011 as we\u2019re coming off of 2009 and 2010, that I drew the line on rents. And, I did draw the line on rents across the portfolio.","Frankly, in retrospect, it may have been a better idea to draw the line on rents only in the highly productive centers and to be a little more relaxed on rents in the Bs and the Cs that we own, and to maybe chase occupancy a little bit more than the Bs and the Cs that we own. But, we are very clear on our strategy today. We had to take a hard line that reestablished the balance of power in negotiations between landlords and the tenants, because the tenants had a hay day in 2009 and that had to stop.","Our focus on same center NOI growth is primarily driven by four factors today. One is to drive our rents in our merchandised mix at our A malls. Two is to drive occupancy at our B malls. A third way of driving our same center growth is to recycle out of our B malls and recycle that money into the repositioning of our A malls, so that\u2019s a big part of the strategy. Four is expense controls.","We had some very significant renegotiation of our total facilities contracts in the mid to latter part of last year that are beginning to flow through our properties this year. So I\u2019m very pleased about that.","But on same center NOI growth, if you look at our history over 20 years, we\u2019ve always been in the top tier of peers. I recognized the importance of this measure going forward, but I also want to let you know that value creation is more important than same-store NOI growth many times, and your brand protection is more important at times.","So there are times that you are better served to take a little bit of less rent in an A center to take a better tenant mix which enhances the brand, enhances the sales of the overall center and as you\u2019ve heard rent is a function of sales and if you take care of the sales, the rent will take care of themselves. So we\u2019re very bullish in terms of prospects for things in our NOI growth was focused on it.","If you take a look at the average rents that are in place in our portfolio today March of 2013 versus March of 2012 we are at 4,763 a foot versus 4,587 a foot and occupancies were up 130 or so basis points and we are very focused on this going forward and that\u2019s part of what gave us the confidence to increase our guidance.","We could have likely increased our guidance a little bit more, but given the noise and the lumpiness and the uncertainty of the recycling disposition program we felt that we did was prudent. At this point in time, we\u2019d like to open it up and welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, I\u2019m seeing really strong performance in rents and rent recoveries in the first quarter. And I wonder if there was any concentration of where that lift came from or maybe just some color behind that \u2013 those strong numbers.","Art Coppola","I mean it really the \u2013 it\u2019s across the portfolio, Craig. You\u2019ve seen nice growth in recoveries. And particularly if you look at recovery percentage, it\u2019s up because we are able to hold our expenses in line with last year. And that combined with top line rental growth really was a big part of the growth in the first quarter.","Tom O\u2019Hern","We cut about what amounts to 1% of same center expense out of our operating expenses, which is just beginning to flow through our numbers, and those flow equally through every single property.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, great. And, I was wondering if you had a sense of where the occupancy might be at Fashion Outlets in Chicago, when it opens in August 1st.","Tom O\u2019Hern","We don\u2019t control the tenants opening dates. That\u2019s always \u2013 we don\u2019t control the permitting process, the building inspector process, all of those things. Look, we are over 90% signed. Our anticipation is we\u2019re going to open with 90% of the lights on but we don\u2019t control that. We work with them well and we have expeditors all over the place helping them. The tenants are very bullish on what they are doing. And they are doing everything they can to make sure they are open, but we don\u2019t control that process.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. And then just finally the 20 acres next to Green Acres, obviously it will be a lot of big box interest. But, is there something better that you can do with that?","Art Coppola","What we\u2019re evaluating right now is we look the strength of Green Acres is in catering to the masses. And if the center that does as we mentioned when we bought it over $800 million in total sales. So that\u2019s a powerhouse. We\u2019re going to add retailers that bring shoppers.","We\u2019ve already got a very large selection of specialty stores in the mall. So there is now reason to try and to expand that offering. But we\u2019re evaluating it right now. It was no-brainer to buy it. It had been sitting there forever and when we saw that we had an opportunity to buy go and there is a old theater there. When we saw the opportunity to buy it, you couldn\u2019t have bought a more beautifully positioned piece of land. There is not even a street in between it.","The driveway that\u2019s in between it is owned by us. I mean I have never seen where you can buy a property that\u2019s doing $800 million in business and you can buy 20 acres of contiguous land right next door with that kind value. It\u2019s \u2013 it was a no-brainer. There was lose tons of tenant demand and we\u2019ll see what we do. There could be an expansion of the mall and part of that land is used for surplus parking, which is much cheaper than we would have had to have faced using deck parking, we\u2019ll see.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Yes, that was a pleasant surprise. And let\u2019s assume that\u2019s great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","We\u2019re starting to work on buying, the land before, we even sign the contract to buy the mall. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hello, good morning guys.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","One of the things, we had heard a bit recently is that getting CMBS debt for B-quality malls was getting more difficult than it had been. Do you guys have any thought obviously some of your buyers for the 14 assets might need CMBS debt. And I\u2019m curious do you have any thoughts on the CMBS market and specifically with regard to regional malls and maybe the B assets in particular?","Art Coppola","Sure. We\u2019re not been answering any B assets on our own. So we\u2019re not a good proxy for that. I would point out to you that we\u2019ve placed $820 million \u2013 or $925 million of debt on two malls that had JC Penney as an anchor. And that was Queens and Green Acres all in the last three months, but obviously those are not B-malls.","The buyers that are working on deals with us, generally are putting between 60% to 70% debt on the properties and it\u2019s I think CMBS in every case, the rates that I\u2019m seeing that they\u2019re seeing are pretty attractive. They are within 50 basis points of what we\u2019ve been borrowing even as they stretch their leverage up to 65% to 70%. Some of these malls have JC Penney and Sears as two of the three anchors. All of them have one or the other and some of them have both as part of four.","I\u2019ve not seen any impact whatsoever in terms of the lending world and I\u2019ve heard the noise about that on other calls. I have not seen the impact now. It does matter, where your JC Penney is located.","So if it\u2019s a JC Penney, that\u2019s in a mall that\u2019s doing $220 a foot, you\u2019re not going to be able to get a CMBS loan. Just like if it was a Nordstrom anchored center that was doing $220 a foot, you\u2019re not going to be able to get a CMBS loan. So I mean really the productivity of the center I think is the more relevant fact. Certainly, the lenders are willing to learn.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Rich, I\u2019d characterize it as still being very aggressive in the CMBS not two weeks ago with San Tan Village and it was very, very, very competitive. And as I said, we are not financing any B\u2019s right now, but we have been hearing from the brokers as it relates to some of the assets in our disposition program and they still characterize the borrowing environment as very borrower-friendly and that the underwriters in CMBS are being very, very aggressive. That\u2019s a...","Art Coppola","The quality of the asset is key, all right. So remember that. The other point I would make out is that \u2013 we would make is that, look, one of the guys that\u2019s really active in the CMBS market, is the same investment bank that just loaned $1.75 billion to JC Penney.","Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, fair enough, all right. Good, guys. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi. Couple quick ones here. When we\u2019re looking at the disposition range of $500 million to $1 billion, is there a certain number within the range that\u2019s ideal the way to look at it, I mean as \u2013 is a 1 billion better than 750 million?","Art Coppola","No, not really. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 look it\u2019s opportunistic, 500 million could be a great result, a 1 billion could be a great result, it\u2019s very opportunistic. We\u2019re not chasing a number, we\u2019re just exposing these properties to the market, we\u2019re very far along in the process. But very far along could mean that we\u2019ve got somebody that\u2019s in due diligence and there go hard date could be tomorrow. So it\u2019s really hard to talk about the process right now.","Other than, we\u2019ve had substantial interest, and we\u2019re extremely confident about the lower end of the range. We don\u2019t control whether buyers actually perform, we don\u2019t control, whether they step up and go hard, when their go hard date is. So we can\u2019t prognosticate what the ultimate number would be.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Got it. And okay. And then, if we look at the year-over-year occupancy gain that you posted this quarter, would that appear a same-store increase or how much of an impact was there from acquisitions and dispositions in there?","Art Coppola","Mike that was mostly same \u2013 same center. I mean you\u2019ve got all of the detail in the supplement, where you not only see sales by assets, but also occupancy. So you can see a relative occupancy levels in some cases, actually the acquisitions have a lower occupancy level in our \u2013 reported numbers, so most of that was same center gain in the quarter.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","On the development schedule, just maybe you could provide a little bit color, I mean, are you \u2013 I think you said last quarter that you really have kind of plans for the majority of the top couple of tiers at least of your portfolio and the way you group them and you chose to put the one that you did in the development, how should we think kind of \u2013 what does that mean for those versus the others, when would you kind of what do you characterize being kind of real enough to provide that disclosure and kind of how would that evolve going forward?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I would expect that you\u2019ll see the shadow pipeline grow each quarter through the foreseeable future, and I would expect that you\u2019ll see properties doing that are in the shadow pipeline move up to the in-process grouping periodically. I\u2019d expect that if it shows up on the shadow pipeline, let\u2019s say the probability of that it\u2019s going to become a reality is extremely high.","We took the attitude that let\u2019s kind of start with a skeletal approach on this first quarterly provision of the supplement and will be adding to it. One of the debates was that we do have many properties where we have a $10 million or $20 million repositioning that we\u2019re pursuing or $8 million opportunity that\u2019s still creating value and we didn\u2019t want to \u2013 we\u2019re still kind of debating and John Perry is helping us to think about how we provide kind of clean disclosure without it being a syllabus of activity. So you\u2019ll see additions to the shadow pipeline and my guess is every quarter for the foreseeable future.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","All right, you\u2019re two-for-two on a disclosure side this course. I look forward to what comes out next quarter as well. On the","Tom O\u2019Hern","We just need the guidance from you on that and then we can try and I\u2019ve given you some. I will give you more if you like. On the occupancy, I appreciate the detail there and when you actually look at it, a lot of that kind of pickup and occupancy.","Your mid tier centers are kind of 20 miles that are up 200 basis points. Kind of in the context of what you said earlier, I mean is that a reflection of a change in strategy. Some of it maybe kind of driven by these some of these are being marketed or is it just \u2013 are you seeing a pickup in mid-tier demand that is kind of noteworthy.","Art Coppola","Bobby, you want to address that.","Bob Perlmutter","Sure. Paul, its Robert Perlmutter. I would say in general it reflects an improving environment for some of the mid tier centers and I think that improves a couple of ways. One is the just starting with the supply. The shrinkage is much lower than it was a couple of years ago where bankruptcies were not really so much higher.","So I think there is some stabilization in performance and I think the other thing we see is the activity with the national retailers, a number of national retailers are rolling out formats more targeted towards the mid tier centers people like us. So many of the retailers have open to bias in this category that a couple of years ago they didn\u2019t have. So, I would say, it\u2019s general improvement in the environment and the retailer demand for the mid-tier centers.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then just lastly on the delay deal where the rents versus your kind of pro forma going in now that you do?","Bob Perlmutter","It hit our pro forma. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in very good shape both the two anchor deals we\u2019ve got are right at pro forma. So, our anticipation is that the balance of the lease up \u2013 we should easily hit our pro forma or above. We feel very good about \u2013 we feel really good about where we are on the entire project and in all five elements of it.","And I do want to emphasize all five elements of Tysons, and the appliance is one of those five elements, because that\u2019s the staging area, and the connectivity that is going to make this such a unique property and it\u2019s going to feed each of the properties, the retail property. It\u2019s the synergies of having one owner develop this are massive, had we sold off the air rights to anyone of the towers, the opportunity to cross markets, cross brand and plan the traffic between the different elements, would have been loss, which would have been a shame.","So Alaska and Macerich, the Alaska Permanent Fund, which is a very thoughtful investor and we planned out from the very beginning and thought about selling off development rights to others then came to the conclusion that we should \u2013 we need to build this on our own to protect the golden goose, which is the retail, but to make sure that it all works together, and the thesis that you know, that there was synergy and then opportunity to cross market, and across brand. We\u2019re already seeing the reality.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Art Coppola","Hi, Quentin.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hi, good morning, out there. Just in terms of the \u2013 the new development disclosure, which is great to have, just wanted to try and basically reconcile some numbers, if you look at the schedule, you\u2019ve got a total of about $179 million, which is your CIP or your pro rata capitalized costs, but then, if you look across that the balance sheet, there is a total, it\u2019s more or like $430 million.","So there is a roughly $250 million gap between the two. You just mentioned a couple questions ago that some of it is the smaller type projects, but can you maybe just run through how much is the smaller projects and what else is in that spread?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yeah, another quick reconciliation, it\u2019s not going to take much time here because we don\u2019t have that much. On page seven of the supplements, you\u2019ve got your consolidating balance sheet. And you\u2019ve got $317 million listed as CIP for wholly owns. And, Chicago is 67 of that on page 30. We have Estrella Falls 31 in Niagara10. In addition to that, we have numerous things that we got to capture in CIP for GAAP purposes.","There are non-cash items. Some cases, it\u2019s imputed land value, which is what we have in Chicago. In some cases you have to capitalize interest even though you don\u2019t have a construction loan. That\u2019s a non-cash GAAP entry. And, there is about a $100 million or so of this non-cash allocations in that CIP number. And then, there is about $100 million or so are small projects \u2013 probably 20 or so projects in total of makeup that number.","If you look at the joint venture number there, it\u2019s 112 million in CIP, our pro rata share that\u2019s disclosed in bullet number 3 there on page 7, and that\u2019s made up of $67 million from Tysons Corner, which ties to page 30, $4 million from Broadway Plaza, which ties to page 30 also. And then, other JVs and the accounting adjustments are about $40 million or so. That gets you to $112 million.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just secondly, can you just talk a little bit about your schedule at RECon in Vegas in a few weeks time. How it compares to last year and is there any sort of new concepts we should be thinking about?","Art Coppola","Well, I can speak from our experience. Our schedule is very strong, stronger than last year. We actually extended our hours on Sunday for a full day, which previously was a half a day. So I think the \u2013 the lease environment continues to improve. We talk a lot about new concepts, and new concepts coming, two of the centers, gets a lot of press. But if you look at our 10 largest tenants, they really are equally or more important to us. And generally, our 10 largest tenants are doing very, very well that really bodes well for the coming years.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christy McElroy with UBS.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Good morning, Christy.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Tom, maybe I\u2019m being a little too technical or reading too much into this. But the updated quarterly percentages that you gave for guidance would imply 25% for Q1, which at $0.86 would put you at the upper end of your new range. Is that what we should take away from that. Or should we be thinking about the Q1 number sort of excluding any one-time items like the un-depreciated asset sale?","Tom O\u2019Hern","The first quarter was $0.86 and a 25%.","Art Coppola","Yeah. It gets you in the range, but there is always rounding in these things, Christy. I mean that could \u2013 to be accurate and had to taken out three or four digits and that\u2019s really implied. I could have said 23 to 24 for Q2 and Q3 and 24 to 25 for Q1. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.","Jean Wood","And I especially","Tom O\u2019Hern","Okay Jean.","Art Coppola","Proceed with the dispositions, not controlling the timing of that. I crunch when I hear Tom give quarterly guidance with all of that activity going on, because if the disposition closes one month, I mean versus another it can change things. So I\u2019d look at for this year, in particular I\u2019d be looking at the year, but obviously Tom has given you his best customer on the guidance on the quarters.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","And obviously, we will revisit at the end of the second quarter, when we will have even more information on the disposition program we can true it up then if need be.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","And then with regard to other income, the last two quarters, it\u2019s kind of spike tear. Wondering if there is anything one time in their and what we should be looking at for sort of our run rate going forward?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No, it\u2019s part of it is function of we have more wholly owned assets now, because we bought up our interest and flat from 25% to 100% obviously we did the same with arrowhead, we had at Green Acres and King\u2019s. So if you go to the consolidated income statement and the supplement you see that if you take other income all the way across to that $19 million for the quarter. And that is a good run rate, we\u2019re going to run on average $19 million to $20 million per quarter in there. There is a lot of things that go in their advertising Telecom operating machine, gift cards, sponsorship income and it\u2019s an area this is, but I think that\u2019s probably a pretty good run rate.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Got it, so previously you had that?","Tom O\u2019Hern","That\u2019s right.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","And just lastly that on the last quarter you mentioned a $2 million acquisition costs on Green Acre was that an operating expenses?","Art Coppola","Yeah was in I think we came at a little bit less than that we came in above 15, 16.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Christy.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning out there. Niagara Fashion Outlet, I\u2019m wondering how much of the customer base there as Canadian driving in from Toronto, obviously premium outlet opens in August in Toronto. And can the greater super regional market support another 600,000 700,000 feet of outlet space?","Tom O\u2019Hern","80% of our customers come from Canada and they come to fashion outlets of Niagara because of the embedded differential in prices. There is a between 12% and 15% difference in the price structure for multiple reasons. And, we are \u2013 our retailers that are leasing space in our 172,000 foot expansion are very confident that that market and that price advantage will remain and they are very bullish in their interest level, and the rents that they will pay us for the expansion. So look at the \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s going to have an impact on the marketplace, but my guess is that it\u2019s going to have more impact on Toronto retail than fashion outlets of Niagara.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And, I assume a lot of the merchants you are talking to open up two stores these centers, is that fair to say, or I guess you wouldn\u2019t know if they are going to be in premium outlet?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I can\u2019t comment on their tenant roster because I haven\u2019t really paid attention to it because I don\u2019t really that it\u2019s relevant to what we\u2019re doing.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Art Coppola","What they are doing is fine and great for them, and I\u2019m sure it will be a great tenant roster, but I really don\u2019t see the centers being competitive at all with each other.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, okay. On Kings Plaza, as you guys acquired, it looked like to me that Gap closed their brands at the Center; do you have any insight into their decision?","Bob Perlmutter","Josh, this is Bob Perlmutter. I think Gap\u2019s decision to close their Gap store was based on underperformance within the center and our ability to take a larger space and bring in more productive tenants at higher rents. They continue to operate the Old Navy, which is pretty productive and has a term left. So I think that was really a specific tenant that didn\u2019t resonate with the customer.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And I\u2019m curious if Green Acres and Kings came as a package deal, or could you have bought these two separately, and would you wanted to that?","Art Coppola","Well, we spend a lot of time on the last earnings call, talking about that question. So I could tell you that we were offered both properties at the same time, and we were actually offered more than both properties at the same time. There were other properties, we were offered, but we always wanted to buy these two properties, we bought these two properties and we\u2019re thrilled that we bought these two properties.","Joshua Patinkin \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning out there.","Art Coppola","Hi, Alexander.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey. And yeah, it is amazing you have 20 acres just for sale next to Green Acres and it wasn\u2019t thought. Two questions, my two questions. The first question is, Art, after the last quarter, you did your listening tour. And apart from releasing the day before, you know at probably at 4 PM, which is great, what was the feedback that most surprised you?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m not being cute with you here honestly.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay.","Art Coppola","I think I have to answer that. The conclusion that I came to was that we can do a better job telling our story, and that\u2019s on all levels. Disclosure is just one of them. We have a great story. And I came to the conclusion that you know, that we could do a better job telling our story and telling in \u2013 and a better job telling a story part of its disclosure.","The part of it is also telling the story to more than the normal universe of investors than we have told in the past. So going forward, we\u2019re going to be seeking to inroads into investment groups that currently are not in our shareholder base and may not even be in the REIT shareholder base.","I guess the \u2013 look, whether it\u2019s surprising or otherwise. The biggest takeaway I have with that \u2013 doing a great job, running your business is not enough. That you have to also do a great job telling the story that you\u2019re doing a great job running your business. I know we do a great job running our business and I guess I may have slipped into a belief that that was enough that everybody would notice, but I did come with a conclusion that we could do a better job telling this story disclosure just part of that.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then, Tom, on the 6.2% growth in sales. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s on a total portfolio. Do you\u2019ve the number for what it would be on a comp pool, so we can see the impact of the acquisitions versus what the same store pool prove in that \u2013 in sales?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Alexander, your assumption is right that its total portfolio compared to the portfolio a year ago. And, although I don\u2019t have that you\u2019ve got the detail there, so you could have a pretty good idea of what the new assets, Green Acres and Kings may have done to that number, but they are close. It\u2019s not going to move too much on a same set of basis, but I don\u2019t have that.","Art Coppola","Yeah. Green Acres was right at the average and Kings was a little bit above the average, but when you look at the overall pool, if you\u2019re 200 basis points above the average, it doesn\u2019t move to that much.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Right. And we had a disposition last year that was above our average, just going the other way.","Art Coppola","Right.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thanks.","Operator","And, we will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Good morning, Tayo.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","How are you guys? First of all congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick question on the tenant base. We\u2019re talking very positively about what\u2019s going on with the tenant base, but just kind of curious, are there any retail categories where there are issues that you\u2019re worried about or any kind of tenants on watch list that you are worried about?","Art Coppola","We definitely have tenants that are watched closely and \u2013 in all categories both the specialty stores as well as the big boxes. And, some of those tenants that were on that list a couple of years ago, many of them were junior tenants that have actually rebounded fairly strongly.","In past quarters, people like Best Buy and others have been getting a lot of press. So many of them have rebounded, I would say that, in general, we\u2019re finding the watch list to be stable or declining.","We see the overall health of the retailers being better. In particular, we see the big boxes moving more into the mall environment and particularly in some of the B centers. That\u2019s been a big improvement people like Ulta and TJ Maxx and others are now looking at the mall as an expansion of their store base. So, in general, it\u2019s overall improving the environment. It doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t isolated incidents. Most of them are isolated companies as opposed to categories.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Art Coppola","Thank you. I think we have time for a couple of more questions. Operator?","Operator","We will take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you. And thanks again for the new disclosures on the occupancy cost ratios. Looking at those numbers, your group two of sellers to \u2013 so the top 11 to 20 has an occupancy cost ratio that\u2019s meaningfully lower than group one, and somewhat lowered and in some of the subsequent groups. And is there anything you can do in particular in some of those centers to push rent, so is that related to the mix including the fashion outlets being part of the group that\u2019s depressing the occupancy cost ratio?","Bob Perlmutter","I mean, I would tell you there is a couple of items that are probably more mix related than drawing any general conclusions, you mentioned the outlet center, Broadway Plaza is obviously a center that is going to potentially be substantially redeveloped. So right now, it\u2019s got a lower cost of occupancies as we keep tenants short-term.","The other factor is you have a number of open air centers there, which generally have lower than expected operating expense cost than some of the enclosed centers. So I would say that it\u2019s more just a nuance of the mix and the timing that some of those centers are in their life cycle as opposed to any conclusions.","Tom O\u2019Hern","There is the one point that I would make is that \u2013 hopefully I\u2019m reading my \u2013 our own charts correctly. If I\u2019m ready them correctly that our top 10 centers do $831 a foot, and that the next group does $623 a foot. There is a totally different dynamic at a center that does a $1,000 a foot than a center that does $650 a foot.","You have tenants at places like, Queen Center, Tysons Corner and even Kings Plaza now where their occupancy costs might be 30% of sales at times and you go to try and replace them and they can\u2019t leave, because they have to be in the center to protect their own brand.","Likewise, when you\u2019re offering space that happens to be available in the center like that. It\u2019s not all lot of the question to set the rent at levels where the tenant believes they are paying 15% to 20% of their sales, because at those sales levels they can make money at that kind of occupancy costs. So, I would totally expect the most productive centers to have the highest rent as a percentage of sales.","Queen\u2019s, we\u2019ve been running Queen\u2019s for 18 years at roughly 20% cost of occupancy as a percentage of sales. Now what happens is the good news is we\u2019ve increased the square footage from 130,000 feet to 430,000 feet and we will increase the sales from $600 a foot to $1,000 a foot, and therefore the income has gone up more than 600%. So, it is also an actual dynamic of high productivity centers.","And as Bob said in the next grouping, open air centers generally are going to have lower cost of occupancies and we also have centers in that second group that are awaiting to come into the \u2013 to be redeveloped. So, many times just renewing leases on the short-term basis and the rents are staying basically at the same levels that they\u2019ve been.","So, Broadway Plaza, even those it\u2019s a high productive center we\u2019re not driving rents there, because we\u2019re keeping the leases short, because the long-term plan is to demolish the majority of the center.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. So if you could renew all your leases in today\u2019s market rates, what do you think would be occupancy cost ratio in the first grouping of centers versus some of the lower groupings?","Art Coppola","You mean theoretically if you said....","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Theoretically...","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, as Art mentioned, one of the dynamics were seen at the most productive centers, the Queens Center and the Tysons Corner, so the world is. Historically we\u2019ve always looked at an opportunity to take a larger space at lower rent and make it smaller spaces at higher rent.","We\u2019re actually seeing the opposite happen at some of these centers where tenants are paying premiums for multilevel flagship stores and tenants step-up to an occupancy cost that is partly based on their P&L and party based on the importance of the store within their store program and at these iconic center. So we\u2019re reaching 20% and higher at the top part of the portfolio and anywhere from the mid to high teens at the balance of the top tier.","Art Coppola","Look if I had to take a stab at that answer. I would tell you that our top 10 centers, if you started with a pallet that had the land at they\u2019re located on, the department stores that are in-place and the small shops sitting there waiting for us to come in and lease them with complete flexibility you\u2019d have occupancy cost of 20% at least on those top 10 centers which is actually the situation that we\u2019re creating at Broadway Plaza. We\u2019re running a little bit short on time and we do \u2013 I think we have one more question, Cedrik do you have anything else that you\u2019d like to cover right now?","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","No, thanks very much for the answers.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Cedrik.","Operator","And we have time for one more question and that will be from Ben Yang of Evercore Partners.","Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good morning, thanks. Art, you\u2019d mentioned feeling extremely comfortable that you will sell at least $0.5 billion on the disposition program, which is probably only 3 or 4 of the 17 malls that you\u2019re actively marketing. And \u2013 I know you kind of threw everything else there, but are buyers actually taking a look all 17 malls or is it in the concentrated at the higher end of that \u2013 of the malls that you\u2019re trying to sell?","Art Coppola","At the end of the day, we will probably sell six or seven properties out of the 17 that were offered. And, that\u2019s about the best I can give you in the way of an answer right now. That doesn\u2019t mean there are not people asking about others, but to get more specific could jeopardize some conversations.","There could be some people looking at all of them. I really \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get into any more detail on the numbers. Remember, I\u2019ve said there could be some sensitive questions that gets into the sensitive area, but \u2013 I think the relevant issue for our balance sheet is how many dollars are we are going to recycle. And, I feel very comfortable at the low range \u2013 end of the range that we are going to recycle and range $500 million of new cash to redeploy.","Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, fair enough. So you think 6 to 7 malls this year \u2013 maybe some interest in some of the other malls that\u2019s higher, end up selling? Do you think you\u2019re kind of continue this program into next year to see to try to sell more assets basically at that point or is this going to be a once you kind of sell those 6 or 7 initially?","Art Coppola","We advertised that as a limited time offer and that\u2019s what it is at this point in time. It\u2019s a one-time limited time offer and then we will see where we go from here. I\u2019ve gotten frankly as a result of sitting in management committee meetings with buyers and having a renewed focus on some of these assets.","Frankly I\u2019ve \u2013 I see upside in them. That is there. So \u2013 look, it\u2019s a one-time limited time offer and I would not at all be surprised that this is it for now. And, but it also \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we continue to prune. We will see where we go. I want to thank you all for joining us and sorry for running over a little bit, but we did want to take Ben\u2019s question.","And we look forward to talking to you soon.

Welcome to The Macerich Company Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions."," ","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and would like to now turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."," ","Jean Wood"," ","Thank you, everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s press release and SEC filings."," ","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which is posted in the Investors section of the Company\u2019s Web site at www.macerich.com."," ","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations."," ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."," ","Tom O'Hern"," ","Thanks, Jean. Welcome, it's been a couple of months since we saw most of you at our Investor Day on November 18th in Santa Monica, with some great acquisitions leading into that Investor Day and with many of our management team members presenting on a variety of topics including development project status. We\u2019ll be updating much of that information for you today as well as our view on 2015."," ","Consistent with past practice, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean."," ","So it was another very strong quarter for us across the board, we continue to see strong operating results, leasing spreads were good and leasing volumes were very significant. We signed leases on 516,000 square feet of space that compared to 330,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2013. The releasing spreads were positive 22%, mall occupancy was at 95.8%, that\u2019s up 125 basis points from a year ago looking at that stat on a same-center basis we\u2019re up 70 basis points from 95.1% at 12\/31\/13."," ","Temporary occupancy was 5.1% of that occupancy, compared to 5.8% at December 31st of last year to, it\u2019s down about 70 basis points from year ago, but we still have a lot of progress to make on that front and that will continue to be a focus for us. Average mall store base rents are now over $50 a foot, they increase to $51.15 up 6% from $48.16 a year ago."," ","Looking at FFO for the quarter, reported FFO was $0.99, compared to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of last year, reflected in FFO was a $9.1 million early extinguishment of debt penalty $0.06 a share that was on the early payoff of Vintage Faire and Fresno Fashion Fair of loans which were combined $250 million and at an average interest rate of 6.2%. We arranged a new $280 million, 3.49% 11 year fixed rate loan to be placed on Vintage Faire essentially replacing that debt that we paid off and Fresno will remain unencumbered for now. Excluding the prepayment penalty we came in at $105 for the quarter right in the middle of our guidance range."," ","Impacting net income for the quarter, but not FFO was a $1.5 billion re-measurement gain that is recorded for accounting purposes as a result of converting our ownership of Queens, Lakewood, Los Cerritos, Stonewood and Washington Square from an unconsolidated 51% to a consolidated 100%. The gain is essentially a value of our 51% interest at the date of the transaction less our book basis. Same-center NOI for the quarter increased by 5.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, this increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive releasing spreads, annual CPI increase on leases. We think however it's more meaningful to look at a full year same-center NOI for year ended December 31, 2014 same-center NOI growth was 4.24%."," ","During the fourth quarter we had stronger occupancy, lease term revenue and percentage rents than we had forecast. Term fees are included in same-center NOI as they are a recurring part of our business and unlike straight-line rents, it is a cash revenue. It can cause some quarterly fluctuation as it relates to same-center NOI growth and that\u2019s why we feel it's more meaningful to look at a 12-month calculation for that metric or at least a year-to-date calculation."," ","For lease terminations for the year came in at $11.8 million that was only slightly higher than our guidance level of $10 million and in fact our average annual lease termination revenues over the past five years have averaged 9.6 million. We had a $2.6 million gain on land sale during the quarter and offsetting that gain and included in REIT G&A costs were $3 million worth of transaction costs related to the acquisition activity in the fourth quarter and that is included in REIT G&A and caused the increased to 12.1 million in total. Bad debt expense for the quarter was $700,000 that compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. And as a result of refinancing activity and the interest rate environment we\u2019ve been in our average interest rate is down to 3.5%, compared to 4.2% in the fourth quarter of last year."," ","The balance sheet continues to be in great shape with the strongest balance sheet in the history of our Company. At quarter end some of the balance sheet metrics included debt-to-market cap at 33%, interest coverage ratio of 3.8 times, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis 7.2 times, average debt maturity 5.2 years and floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt is 17%. We continue to see a great financing environment given our ability to borrow with such attractive rates. As I mentioned we paid off Fresno Fashion Fair and Vintage Faire early and secured a very attractive 3.49% financing on Vintage Faire, that\u2019s a 11 year fixed rate term."," ","We also have some other attractive financing opportunities ahead of us this year including Lakewood Mall which is very under leveraged and currently carries a 5.43% interest rate and Washington Square, which has a 6.02% coupon, those would be financed later this year no doubt at substantial savings."," ","In this morning\u2019s press release we also gave FFO guidance the range is $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This assumes no asset sales in 2015. It does include dilution of about $0.10 a share from the assets we sold in 2014. It reflects a same-center NOI growth rate of 4.25% to 4.75%. We\u2019re seeing the benefit of the pruning that we did to our portfolio in 2013 and \u201914 and that\u2019s reflected in this assumption and our expectation of seeing accelerating same-center NOI growth. The guidance assumes $10 million of lease termination revenue, just slightly less than actual of $11.8 million this year, there has been no acquisitions factored into that guidance and there has been no gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt factored into guidance and you can see that those guidance assumptions are detailed in our supplement."," ","Again looking at the quarterly split on the FFO guidance, the first quarter is expected to be 21%, second quarter 24%, third quarter 25% and the fourth quarter 30%. Looking at tenant sales for a moment, total portfolio sales per foot for the year were $587 that compared to 562 last year, if you look at that calculation on a same-center basis it was $587 compared to $574. The top regions for us were Arizona and Southern California and if we take a look at total sales for the period, the quarter ended December 31, 2014 total sales was about 2.2%."," ","So at this point I'd like to turn it over to Art."," ","Art Coppola"," ","Thank you, Tom. First of all I would like to briefly address the speculation in the market regarding Simon Property Group's investment in Macerich. As you likely know in November 2014, Simon announced that it had acquired a stake in our company, at this point there is really nothing more that we can share with you. It is our policy not to comment on market rumors or speculation and we do not intend to make any further comments or statements during this call regarding Simon."," ","With that I want to remind you that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter and full year's earnings results as well as our outlook for 2015. We would appreciate it, if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on these topics."," ","Turning now to the results for 2014 as Tom has outlined for you, it was a terrific year for our Company, it wasn\u2019t transformational but it was certainly an evolutionary year where many important benchmarks were reached. From an operating viewpoint, we put up some very good numbers with occupancy levels increasing, leasing was extremely strong, the environment is extremely good. Our spreads remained very-very good during the year, up 22% for the trailing 12 months."," ","As Tom outlined for you our balance sheet is in terrific shape and we see the opportunity in the next 18 months to even further enhance it with some very opportunistic refinancing opportunities coming up available to us. Development, we've some significant milestones during the year, some great accomplishments on portfolio management."," ","As we look at the development activities during the course of 2014 and our outlook for 2015, again we've some very good milestones at Tysons, our office tower is now over 80% leased, the residential tower is leasing up extremely well and the hotel is poised to open here later on at the end of this quarter or the beginning of next."," ","At Scottsdale Fashion Square as well as Cerritos were well underway on construction to add two new junior anchors at each of them, a sporting goods operator Dick's at each of them and a major theater complex Harkins at each of them. Speaking of theaters, the theatre at Santa Monica Place construction there is going along well with an opening there anticipated here later on in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year are coupled with the second generation releasing of this center that theatre is already spawning significant renewed interest into the center particularly into the third level. Looking to the third level of the property for example, we recently signed and are actually under construction, in the recycling of some existing restaurant space in their new Cheesecake Factory, which we think will do terrific here in this market. We also have new major tenants such as Uniqlo that has replaced Love Culture and I'm sure there may be other retailers at Santa Monica Place that Bob may point out to you that we've either recycled or are recycling all with a view towards really taking this center up to a very significant level of improvement in the productivity."," ","At Broadway Plaza we had a terrific first part of our expansion there with the demolition and complete reconstruction of a parking deck that was contiguous to Nordstrom, this was necessary to create the footprint for the expansion of Broadway Plaza that was done and completed all within six or seven months which is really terrific."," ","At Fashion Outlets of Niagara our expansion opened up on-schedule, on-budget, well-leased, well over 85% leased. At Kings Plaza our remodel and re-merchandizing is going tremendously well and we're moving along very well on our entitlements at the Gallery. From a portfolio management viewpoint, we further recycled out of our couple of lower productivity centers and into some high productivity properties. With the disposition of the assets that we sold in 2014, we then turned around and during the course of the year increased our ownership at Fashion Outlets of Chicago to 100% and also to 100% in five malls in the Ontario transaction, another key investment that we made during the year obviously was the Gallery in Philadelphia and we're very bullish about that."," ","As I look forward to 2015 and beyond, the Company is extremely well-poised, as a result of our portfolio management that we've done over the previous three or four years, we've our balance sheet is well positioned to finance all of our activities going forward. The leasing outlook is terrific, as I look at upcoming development activities that we have the new ones that we've announced. We announced a couple of months ago our joint venture to build a 500,000 square foot outlet center at Candlestick Park in San Francisco demand for that center from a retailers\u2019 viewpoint has been very significant. We\u2019re very bullish on that."," ","At Green Acres we moved that project up to our active development pipeline that is really the expansion of our retail campus for adding 335,000 square feet of restaurants, pads as well as operators such as Dick\u2019s, home goods, actually furniture and others. We\u2019re very optimistic about the impact that\u2019s going to happen in the retail campus. This is a center that you may remember that when we bought it a couple of years ago it was doing $500 a square foot, today it\u2019s doing over $575 square foot leasing activity in the mall has been very dramatic. This expansion of retail the campus we think is going to even further enhance the retail destination. We think that it will actually cause the campus to exceed 1 billion in sales over the years upfront."," ","And we anticipate the announcement of a new anchor that will be attached and part of the closed mall itself in the very near-term. A new project that we\u2019ve talked about that is now in our shadow pipeline is the further densification of Scottsdale Fashion Square. You should think of Scottsdale somewhere in the same context that you think about Tysons Corner it\u2019s a huge retail project and we\u2019re blessed that Scottsdale to have excess land that is going to enable us to further densify that property. Again we talked about the expansion of the property that is currently underway and this densification we think we\u2019ll just further enhance the retail destination."," ","Speaking of the destination at the Super Bowl this last week, the NFL had their Fan Fest camp and activities at Scottsdale Fashion Square on the seven acres of vacant land that we have outlined as densification opportunities. We generated over a 0.5 million visitors to that project during the course of the four or five days leading up into the Super Bowl and it was very dramatic in terms of the traffic increases and the sales increases we enjoyed."," ","At Tysons Corner we are underway with perfecting the next phase of the entitlements and that\u2019s really spawned by the confidence that we have in the leasing activities that we have particularly in the residential side. We anticipate that at The Gallery in Philadelphia that we will be in a position to announce jointly with our partner Penn REIT, the scope of the project the size of the dollars as well as the incremental returns over the next quarter or so."," ","At Chicago in North Bridge it was announced during the quarter that we acquired a square block contiguous to across the street from Nordstrom which is either the number one or number two Nordstrom store in the United States in terms of sales volume. And that square block was acquired it\u2019s about 65,000 square feet of building area. We see that we will have opportunities to integrate that into Upper Michigan Avenue with the opportunity to have FAR on that site of about 780,000 square feet. We are in early planning phases on that project a likely outcome will be that we would do the retail and anything vertical above that would most likely be an air rights deal with other folks during that development."," ","Another significant activity that happened somewhat in the development arena that will affect us in this year and next year, is that Sears announced that they along with the Macerich through our corporation Sears announced that they are going to bifurcate their stores at Freehold and Danbury two of our great centers where Sears will occupy one level of their two-level store, consolidate and rationalize into that and they have sublet the other level of their anchor store to Primark. We think it\u2019s a great addition to each of those centers, a high traffic generator and we were happy to cooperate with Sears as they made their deal with Primark and they will be responsible for all capital and connection with that addition."," ","As I think about 2015 and beyond from an operating viewpoint, I take great confidence in the same-center results that we\u2019ve had in the previous year, the outlook that we have for this year and beyond you may remember at our Investor Day that Tom outlined a footprint for you as to how he felt and we feel that we\u2019ll be able to achieve over the next five years the range of same-center NOI that would generally land into the midpoint of around 4.5%. We\u2019re very confident given our outlook for the future, as well as financial modeling as well as just the retail environment that that type of same-center NOI growth is available to us."," ","With that I would like to open it up for Q&A operator."," ","Question-and-Answer Session"," ","Operator"," ","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Again as a reminder, due to time constrains we ask that all participants limit themselves to two questions. You may re-signal at any time for additional questions. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America."," ","Q - Craig Schmidt"," ","I guess a couple of questions on development at Kings Plaza that seems to have been scaled back a little bit maybe some explanation?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I am not sure what you're referring to."," ","Q - Craig Schmidt"," ","I guess, I thought the Kings Plaza was $90 million to $100 million investment, now it\u2019s 65 million to 75 million?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","No, that\u2019s probably just an update in terms of our current view of the cost there. So, actually in looking at our supplement there the $65 to $75 million, I guess is the possible re-merchandizing or re-demising of the Sears store Craig."," ","Q - Craig Schmidt"," ","Okay."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","The other cost that we talked about it's really the re-merchandizing and remodeling of the center and refurbishment of the parking structure."," ","Q - Craig Schmidt"," ","And maybe just a little color on what you want to do at the Westside Pavilion?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","It's a great center, it's a great location, it\u2019s about to get enhanced through the addition of the rail station that connects Downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Beach, the rail station has two stops and they are major retail centers, one across the street from Bloomingdale at Santa Monica and the other one, one block away from Westside Pavilion. But it's a center that really still needs to be re-imagined, we think there are densification opportunities there, we\u2019ve had a significant number of developers and users in the area come and talk to us about that opportunity particularly as it relates to office and residential, we\u2019re going to be debating that and taking that through, but to pave the way for the future there we are already beginning to de-lease of short-term lease the retailers that we have there. The center at last report was doing around $350 a square foot, which is not at all in keeping with its potential. So, we were in early stages of reimagining this center and we anticipate that over the next year or so we will be getting some entitlements to make that possible, but this is a situation where we will have some significant positioning of the center for the ultimate repositioning of that. We don\u2019t have anything clear cut to outline today other than, it's not what it should be, it's a great location and we\u2019re convinced that five years from now it will be significantly better and more profitable and productive than what it is today."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Paul Morgan with MLV."," ","Q - Paul Morgan"," ","Are you into a number of the projects that are in your shadow pipeline and you\u2019ve got on a pro rata basis I guess about $600 million in what you provide in your sub, I mean how should we think of that number as changing over the next year or two, I mean as you roll off Tysons out of it and then put some of these other projects into it. What\u2019s kind of if you look out over the next two or three years what is the number we should think of as kind of being in that asset pipeline?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","We\u2019re constantly taking a look at opportunities Paul to enhance our portfolio and I think that we\u2019re going to make an effort here on a quarterly basis to keep it fresh. I think I said in previous calls that we feel very comfortable with the range of putting into place $250 million to $500 million a year of redevelopment, densification and new development spend and that\u2019s kind of the range as we get some color it comes into some of these to be determined such as Philadelphia and Candlestick, we\u2019ll be able to refine that number better for you. But the bias is toward the uptick in terms of the opportunity and we\u2019re just trying to identify for you the activities and the real projects that we see in the portfolio and as we see new ones coming to give you a heads up in the supplement."," ","Q - Paul Morgan"," ","And then there has been a lot of press past month or so about some of the apparel retailer, bankruptcies and store closings in the malls and maybe you could just provide a little bit of color, I mean you have provided your same-store guidance and then you tried to break out, I mean it looked like there maybe was a little bit more seasonality and what you suggested is that to some of the closings that might take place in the beginning of the year and then how would you characterize kind of the your expectations for a mark-to-market on some of the space you will be getting back?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Well I am going to ask Rob Perlmutter to address that for you and maybe as part of that to give you an update on what happened with the store closings that were talked about at the beginning of last year the Love Cultures and the Coldwaters and such and then also the characterization of the productivity of these store closings that we see coming, the upcoming year their lack of productivity the fact that they are in great centers and our view on the opportunity to merchandize them."," ","A - Robert Perlmutter"," ","Sure Paul, this is Perlmutter and just to start with last year probably the three most significant store closures or bankruptcies were Love Culture, Coldwater and Juicy and that represented about 27 stores portfolio. Generally the stores were located in some of our better centers. So the real estate was strong, we have -- as we sit today about 62% of that has been released in terms of signed leases or deals that have been approved by both the tenant and the landlord and are in documentation. So, we picked up about two-thirds of it."," ","In terms of economics, we're looking at about a high mid single-digit increase in total occupancy cost so there is a reasonably good pick up but one of the key elements for us is an improvement in quality in terms of bringing in more productive retailer. So, to give you a sense some of the new tenants we have brought into those spaces include Soft Surroundings, Anthropology, H&M, Boston Proper, Soma, Aviva, Hanna Andersson , St. John's, Vera Bradley, Karen Millen, Kiehl\u2019s, Godiva, Pandora and Uniqlo. So we have really been able to upgrade the merchandize mix significantly because of the ability to reclaim the real estate and combine that with some uptick in rentals."," ","In terms of the 2015 bankruptcies a couple of comments that the five retailers that have been the most significant include Wetseal, Body Central, Deb Shop, Delila\u2019s, Cach\u00e9 the comment that I would make is none of these bankruptcies come as a surprise, these are all retailers who have been struggling for many years, their sales within our portfolio averaged $212 a foot, our centers are just under $600 a foot. So, we planned in terms of our budgets and our 2015 forecast these store closures and again we believe it will present an opportunity to bring in more productive retailers who ultimately will pay more rent."," ","Q - Paul Morgan"," ","That means there is a little bit of a difference probably I guess in the productivity of some of those guys that are bankrupt this year versus some other ones that were last year I mean is that going to be reflected in different mix in terms of the malls maybe some of the space might not have quite the same demand or is it just going to be more upside?"," ","A - Robert Perlmutter"," ","Well, obviously a re-location is unique in that group Westfield was probably the most significant store in terms of store count. So they were in a variety really throughout our portfolio I think we had them in just under half of our centers. So, they probably have the most diverse real estate, conversely Cach\u00e9 is generally in the top tier centers and presents a very strong opportunity. We had a very small exposure to the other three."," ","Q - Paul Morgan"," ","Okay, and then generally these are kind of reflected you are reiterating what you just provided I guess in terms of your same-store guidance is reflective of this the bankruptcy that have been announced today?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Yes, we budgeted conservatively for example I think Westfield we only factored in one month of rent from the Westfield portfolio in our guidance so, it hasn\u2019t impacted and that's why you see some of the seasonality earlier in the year Paul."," ","Q - Paul Morgan"," ","Great, thank you."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","And Paul I don't want to downplay it but this happens every year and we see this coming usually two to four years before it happens. So, you know that a tenant is underperforming obviously well before a liquidation or a liquidity of that occurs and you're ready for it and look the question is, is that a tenant that is located in a property where demand exceeds supply and virtually across the board everyone of our properties demand exceeds supply. So, the outlook is that look it's an opportunity take back a space before the natural exploration and to bring in better tenants than were there before has outlined by what Bob indicated that we did in 2014 recycling of Love Culture, et cetera."," ","Operator"," ","And we will take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust."," ","Q - Ki Bin Kim"," ","Just a general question on stock issuance I mean because of certain circumstances with Simon I mean your stock is doing very well and imply cap rate trading at 4.5%, and while your balance sheet is in good shape you do have a lot of uses of capital coming up soon in all the new projects, so why not issue stock here and are there certain things that when you're in the middle something like this with Simon maybe nothing happens or something happens but does that preclude your from issuing stock out?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Well first of all, look as we have said in our prepared remarks which I really have we're going to focus today on fourth quarter and full year results and we're not going to really comment on anything that relates to Simon. As it relates to how we think about funding our development pipeline, we're sitting on virtually unused line of credit we've the opportunity to raise very significant financing proceeds from maturities that are coming up in the next 18 months. Tom, add on a few\u2026"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Yes, we have got -- well winning shares is unencumbered that would support a very sizable loan we've got Lakewood which is significantly under leveraged Washington Square. So, some of our big or better assets are unencumbered or have light leverage in loans coming due so we've got the opportunity to put non-recourse long-term low coupon fixed rate financing on there and generate proceeds that can be used for the redevelopment projects."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","And from a portfolio management viewpoint historically over the last three or four years you could think of the recycling of the disposition proceeds while not perfectly matched, that's essentially what has been funding our development pipeline over the past several years and even though from an earnings viewpoint that\u2019s not necessarily earnings accretive day one from an NAV viewpoint than from a future earnings viewpoint which I think is beginning to be reflected in our current same-center numbers is the right move to make. When we think about stock issuance it\u2019s really is there a reason to do it. In November of last year we had that discussion with Ontario then we funded an acquisition with all stock because it made sense for the balance sheet and it was actually accretive to do it. In today\u2019s environment it would be potential for that same situation to exist. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it."," ","Q - Ki Bin Kim"," ","Okay. I mean I will try and keep it more towards Macerich but so it sounds like you\u2026"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","No, I understood."," ","Q - Ki Bin Kim"," ","Yes, yes\u2026"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I appreciate that. At this point in time as it relates to stock issuance again I\u2019d point you back to what we did in November and that made some sense we issued stock, it was accretive at the time and made sense to the balance sheet, but we\u2019re not prone to be issuing stock just because we like the price but if there was a capital there where we have an investment opportunity and we decided that it made sense to fund that through the issuance of stock, like that something that we would consider."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets."," ","Q - Todd Thomas"," ","First question on guidance, sort of two parts; and first, in terms of the same-store NOI growth forecast of 4.25% to 4.75%, how much of the contribution are you expecting from occupancy gains in that number? And then also in terms of the lease term fees in the quarter, just curious whether that was sort of one transaction that really accounted for a good portion of that or what really caused the big jump and how much of that was in the same-store pool?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","First, your question related to occupancy in the 2015 guidance. The overall number were occupancy neutral but we are expecting to continue to reduce the amount of temporary occupancy we have as I said it was 5.1% at year-end and our goal is to take that down between 50 and 100 basis points we typically double the rent we achieved when we convert space from temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy."," ","I think your other question had to do with lease termination payments in the fourth quarter. We had an active fourth quarter in leasing front. It was also fairly active in terms of generating termination payments that wasn\u2019t from any one tenant. We did get a decent size termination payment from Juicy but then there were quite a few others. And again as I mentioned that\u2019s a fairly normal number for us the year came in at $11.8 million we\u2019d average $9.6 million annually over the course of the last five years our guidance in 2015 is again includes $10 million as our assumption for that."," ","The piece that hit in the fourth quarter that related a same-center pool which I think was another part of your question was $5 million that compared to about $600,000 last year. But again that\u2019s one of the reasons we look at that statistic on an annual basis rather a quarter is the lease termination revenue and there is a cost for that because you give up occupancy. So, it hurts your NOI in another way although it benefit you in terms of getting that cash compensation upfront, we really think that\u2019s a statistic we have to take a trailing 12 month number or a full year number to really have a meaningful look at what\u2019s going on there in terms of same-center growth."," ","Q - Todd Thomas"," ","And then second question just on acquisitions I think Art last quarter you hinted at there being a potential acquisition in one of your gateway markets and it sounded like a more traditional sort of operating asset I know you announced San Francisco and the acquisition of interests in the Chicago outlets and the Ontario Teachers deal but just any additional update or thoughts on that other acquisition that you had mentioned is it still in the works maybe you can just shed some light on what\u2019s happening there?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I\u2019m not sure exactly what I was referring to at the time it could have been the consolidation of our partners\u2019 interest at FOC but it also could have been on our last call the announcement of our involvement in the Candlestick development opportunity in San Francisco. But whatever I had in mind at that time was done, and either I may have been referring to Candlestick or FOC I will say since you prompt the question, do we see anything new this year. I think there is an opportunity that there will be a new development project that we will announce this year that will be in a significant market and that will be a fashion outlet."," ","Q - Todd Thomas "," ","Okay. Thank you."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","And I\u2019m going to get a printed transcript of what I just said so that I\u2019ll be ready for your question next quarter. Thank you."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Jim Sullivan with Cowen."," ","Q - Jim Sullivan"," ","Two question, first of all in Primark, Art if you could help us I think in your comments you indicated that there was the deal with Sears with your approval and Primark's initial location that they announced sometime ago was in Boston and that's kind of a street retail at more of a traditional downtown department store location and I think it's about 110,000-120,000 square feet. The sub-leases or the leases from Sears are closer to 70,000 square feet, so I guess my question is going forward to the extent you've been in dialog with Primark at all about their ambitions in the U.S., should we be expecting them to stay with that kind of smaller footprint, number one? And number two, would you expect that you'll be doing some deals directly with them in the coming year or two years?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I do expect that we will do additional business with them in the upcoming year or two. Their footprint really varies based upon the opportunity. The location they picked in Boston was a pretty prime location. Right now they're focused in the Northeast, they required as I understand a very large distribution center in Pennsylvania and they're very serious about their commitment here. So I do anticipate that away from Sears doing deals with them, make sure that we will do deals with them directly. I'd say 70,000 feet is probably on the low-end of the type of deals that they would be doing with us. It's hard to predict a range, but they could be 30,000-40,000 bigger than that in certain markets."," ","Q - Jim Sullivan"," ","Okay then second question for me, obviously we've had a very strong U.S. dollar now for some time and certain individual asset in your portfolio as well as certainly some geographic markets call them kind of gateway markets have benefited looking back over the last several years from international inward bound travel and that foreign shopper and I'm just curious as you think about the business well any impact you saw in the fourth quarter? And as you think about the business going forward, whether you assume that that strong dollar is going to dampen demand or the amount of sales you're going to do from what's been really strong source of demand?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I think for our portfolio, the answer is no, that I do not anticipate seeing any significant impact in terms of the dollar with the exception of one property in that\u2019s Fashion Outlets at Niagara which does rely whether significantly on Canadian cross-border traffic and with the currency changes there it's just more expensive the shopping opportunity in Niagara Falls and so you do have -- we have felt some impact on our sales there, but conversely as I think about our more international tourist centers, centers such as Santa Monica Place, centers such as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner and Fashion Outlets of Chicago. Fashion Outlets of Chicago sales are on fire. Traffic is up 30 some percent. We this week versus last year for the last three or four months Santa Monica Place traffic and sales are very-very robust same as true with the Scottsdale Fashion Square, Tysons Corner so I mean those are the centers that I think of that benefit from international tourism and those shoppers are generally well healed. They plan their trips well in advance and when they're here it\u2019s for usually extended stays and one of their favorite pass-times is spending money."," ","Q - Jim Sullivan"," ","Okay\u2026"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","The numbers speak for themselves just -- we disclosed sales per foot by property so you can look at the centers that you know are beneficiaries of international tourism and you can see the impact."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI."," ","Q - Steve Sakwa"," ","I was wondering if you could just talk about the Group 5 assets and I know you haven\u2019t planned for any dispositions at least in your guidance, but just how do you think about these assets conceptually in the portfolio? The NOI on these centers were down 3% this year, sales were up modestly and I'm just wondering given the attractive financing environment today, why not look to prune these sort of while the opportunity is there?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","We've talked about that in previous calls in terms of the fact that we really see that our disposition and portfolio management has been is roughly complete, but you're right look I see if it made sense four years ago and last year and the year before to recycle out of lower productivity and slower growing assets in the more robust opportunities then it makes sense today. At this point, it's not in our guidance this year in terms of any planned dispositions, but we have said that look we this as a reservoir of capital that we do intend over the next five years to recycle out of those assets and into either new opportunities or more productive assets. So it's just a question of timing Steve. And as this point in time, the market is getting increasingly comfortable with buying these types of assets. So we also compelled to rush into further dispositions here, it's not in our guidance but it's clearly in our long-term plan and I would define our long-term plan to be in over the next three to five years,"," ","Q - Steve Sakwa"," ","I guess just a push a little bit I mean five years it's not clear the financing environment will be as robust as it is today. So is it just a lack of having the capital that you need the capital to put it into deals is it just not wanting to take earnings dilution short-term, is it just the lack of buyer pool you think for these kind of assets?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","No, no, no, they are not for sale, that\u2019s what it is, they are not for sale. And when we get in-bound enquiries which we get them every day, we tell them that, look at this point in time these are not for sale that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s not going to change, and is it in our guidance for 2015? No, but look we have demonstrated more than most that we are perfectly willing to do what we believe is the right thing and that is to repatriate capital keep it for our shareholders and to plough back into great opportunities and I think that we have a unique track-record in our space and that is something we\u2019re going to continue, but it's not in our guidance for this year. Having said that, look, if there is an unforeseen opportunity to redeploy capital in a profitable way that\u2019s a great source of capital to fund that."," ","Q - Steve Sakwa"," ","And now if I could just ask maybe Bob to just to kind of follow-up on some of the bankruptcy related questions, as you just kind of look at your tenant watch list today, I realize that we have had maybe more bankruptcies than we have been accustomed to the last couple of years and some of those situations while they had been out there for a while, maybe came to ahead at the same time, when you just sort of look at your watch list today, how would you characterize it big or smaller than it's been in the past?"," ","A - Robert Perlmutter"," ","Well, a couple of things, I think if you look over the last couple of years prior to 2014, we had abnormally low bankruptcy. So, while it's elevated I don\u2019t think we feel it's elevated to a degree that\u2019s different than the longer-term history. I think many of these tenants are struggling for different reasons whether they are in certain respects obsolete, like a RadioShack or if their more of women\u2019s apparel store that\u2019s not distinguishable from their competition. So everyone is a little bit different, but I think our list has been pretty consistent over the last 24 months and I think each tenant is there for a different reason, but at the end of the day the disposition process and the improvement in the portfolio we think mitigates our exposure to whatever degree of weakness the tenants have."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Mike Mueller with JP Morgan."," ","Q - Mike Mueller"," ","When do you see the office and residential components at Tysons stabilizing?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Well, the office is well over 80% leased right now. So to me it\u2019s stabilized and then the residential occupancy will fill up over the course of this year so anticipate that it will be fully occupied by the end of the year or stabilize than occupied, Tom do you have anything to add to that?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","No, I\u2019d agree with that, I mean office will probably continue to pickup over the course of the year and go from 80% to probably 90% by year-end."," ","Q - Mike Mueller"," ","And then Tom for 2015 guidance, are there any material land sales assumed in there?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","No."," ","Operator"," ","And we will now go to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill."," ","Q - Alexander Goldfarb"," ","So question for you, in LA you\u2019ve got a lot of redevelopments going on, obviously down south of you, Del Amo you got Century City, you have got Beverly Center, you guys originally did Santa Monica Place and now obviously you're launching Westside. How do you think of all the redevelopment and all the capital that\u2019s going into the market as far as -- do you envision that each center is going to focus on a different shopper point or is it simply because of the traffic the sharper rings are very tied to each center and therefore there is not as much competition as all these different entities reinvest in their assets?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","So let's first of all keep it mind, that there are four, or five or six major retail centers in Southern California that are under significant either redevelopment or about be redeveloped. They are generally all are in extremely good locations and they are unbelievably high barriered entry locations, they are generally all in the middle of some wonderful demographic. But of all of the names that you just mentioned, I do think that The Grove, Beverly Center, Century City, Santa Monica Place and maybe even Del Amo they are all kind of chasing the same customer and I think that therein lies the opportunity for Westside Pavilion as to distinguish itself from that and not to chase that same customer."," ","So, we have a wonderful demographic in the very-very really high dense well affluent and educated population in the immediate area of Westside and then you have the impact of the rail which is going to give access to Westside from all the way from Santa Monica to Downtown LA and we see people using the rail to go to Westside from both directions. Landmark is one of the theatres is one of the top two independent film theatre venues in the United States. So we see it as a great opportunity and as you think about the four or five developments and remember they're all redevelopments not new supply it's really generally recycling supply, remember, it's in the middle of the market that is the ninth largest economy in the world. So, it\u2019s money that is getting put into a pretty vibrant economy."," ","Q - Alexander Goldfarb"," ","And then the second question is for Tom. Tom, you spoke about some of the refinancings that you have upcoming. But just if you step back and just look at your debt schedule, you've got a meaningful amount of debt that's floating at a time when interest rates are at all-time lows -- although we all say that, and then they go lower. At the same time, your duration -- or the maturity is only about five years. So what are you thinking as you look out over the next year of activity? Where do you think that debt maturity average is going to go? On the floating rate that is out there, what are ways that you can bring that down to lock in today's rates?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Yes Alex, for one thing if you financed every asset you owned for 10 years, you know what your average maturity would be? It would be five year."," ","Q - Alexander Goldfarb"," ","Exactly."," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","So that's what we've been doing and that's pretty much a normal level that you're going to get to but the floating rate debt is temporarily high because we paid off Vintage Faire and Fresno right before year-end and we used our line so when we financed Vintage Faire on March 1st, that's going to straight to reduced floating rate debt, so that will flip right there. So, you have seen us be extremely active in the financing market, if you look at our maturity schedule it's very attractive in terms of how it's evenly layered out as you get past, you look at 2019 that's the highest level at about $700 million in maturities everything else is under that going all the way out to 2025, that's why we picked 11 years for Vintage Faire that drops it into 2026 and then the 2016 bucket, which looks somewhat high right now is going to be reduced when we refinance Washington Square we will probably go out 10 or 11 years on that and then our line of credit in 2018 causes that year to be a little bit lumpy but we're going to continue to go along when it's available and I think you're going to see the floating rate debt come down fairly significantly just as a matter of refinancing some of these assets we've been talking about."," ","Operator"," ","And we'll now go to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank."," ","Q - Vincent Chao"," ","I have a quick question going back to the bankruptcy discussion. We've been talking about normalization of bankruptcies for a little while, I mean, in getting back to a more historic level, which -- from a lower-than-average level. But I was just curious: it looks like bad debt in the guidance is about $4 million. I think, Tom, if you could correct me -- I think it's about $5.7 million or $6 million or so this year. So just curious how those two tie in since the bankruptcy outlook seems to be going up, but the bad debt is going down a little bit?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Well, bad debt for us is it's a specific calculation and some of these tenants that we're talking about potentially going out here in the first half of this year we've already reserved for them so bad debt expense for many of those tenants hit in 2014. By the time they go out it's too late I mean so you have basically reserved against that and we've averaged in 2012 for the year was $3.5 million of bad debt 2013 was $4.8 million, this year was a little bit higher 5.1 and as we go through and look at specific tenants we're very comfortable with the $4 million that we've guided to in 2015 and it's not too far off from our average over the last five years."," ","Q - Vincent Chao"," ","And then just jumping a little bit over, back to the shadow pipeline -- you guys are showing about $500 million or so at 100%, but quite a few TBDs, and quite a few of the larger projects on the TB side. I'm just curious, just as a -- I know you are not giving out the number, but just from an order of magnitude, it seems like you could fairly easily double that $500 million. And then if you throw in the fashion outlet project that may be coming down the pipe here sometime this year to be announced, and then there's Goodyear that's still out there somewhere. Just curious, is that the right way to think about just, again, order of magnitude?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Yes, other than Goodyear it is down the road significantly but definitely when we put a number on The Gallery later on this year maybe sooner rather than later on Candlestick maybe sooner rather than later at a total cost level for those two that could easily result in a doubling the shadow pipeline, yes."," ","Q - Vincent Chao"," ","Okay, thanks. And so just looking at the expected deliveries on the one that we do have some clarity on, it does seem like that just given that how they are all bunched in that 2017, \u201918 timeframe that the $250 million to $500 million could potentially go higher than that is that, am I thinking about that wrong?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","No, you are not. And you know what we are going to do a little better job over the next quarter of helping to answer that question of what the normalized development spend is per year on a five year period from this point for you. So, we\u2019ll get to you a little better answer. We\u2019re trying to get your heads up on projects as they are clear to us even though if we don\u2019t know the exact number. But I understand your need and modeling to do that we\u2019ll work on that and get you some better model numbers all of you."," ","Operator"," ","And we\u2019ll take our next question from D.J. Busch with Green Street Advisors."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","I just wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments on the equity issuance. Aside from Ontario Teachers', you have a couple other long-term JV partners in some of your best assets. Given where the equity is trading today, have you been more proactive or had discussions with some of these partners about a similar opportunity to sell their current ownership stake and take an equity position in the entire portfolio?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","No."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","Okay. And then\u2026"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Would we be willing to do that of course."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","Yes."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","But it\u2019s not, look it\u2019s their choice as to where they prefer to have their capital and what vehicle they prefer to have it in and the other folks they\u2019re very happy with the investments that they have and they\u2019d love to have more with us."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","Okay."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","But at a real estate level, not necessarily a conversion of real estate for common equity."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","And then, Tom, just one more question, if I may, on the secured market you mentioned that financing was attractive at your Investor Day and then again today. You know, the 10-Year is down over 50 basis points since then. I was wondering if you just could provide a little bit of color on -- you know, if spreads widen and pricing is similar to what it was in November, or if secured rate is falling even further down as the T has gone down?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Well they have, I mean at some point you hit some floors come in, but a recent example of Vintage Faire was very competitively bid even though we were pushing for kind of an off market term at 11 years D.J. which is not normal but a lot of CMBS bidders on that saw it was very competitive and I think rates have even come down a little bit since then we locked in about a month ago. So it\u2019s really very-very competitive out there."," ","Q - D.J. Busch"," ","So maybe not 50 basis points, but -- so the spread has widened, but not to the extent of the full decline in T?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Correct."," ","Operator"," ","And we will take our final question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley."," ","Q - Haendel St. Juste"," ","Art, your Company is in the midst of a rather heavy redevelopment phase within its lifecycle. My question here, I guess, is: as you look to manage your portfolio for cash flow optimization, what do you think the margin impact will be over the next two, three, four years as your redevelopment activity slows and as your re-merchandising efforts take hold? Your margins have been kind of low to mid 60s, excluding certain fees of late. How much upside should we be thinking about on that front?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","My guess is that there is at least as a result of the portfolio, recycling and just everything, all things considered, at least 300-400 basis points improvement available there I will tell you that as it relates to that to operating margin perhaps not a number that most people focus on in running regional shopping centers historically it is certainly a very topical number these days for a lot of self made analysts but if you force me to focus on that metrics, I would tell you that there is definitely 300-400 basis points of improvement available there. As I think about the development pipeline I would point out that some of the new shadow projects are still a couple of years down the road from being put into place and we\u2019re constantly thinking about development opportunities and redevelopment opportunities. So the whole purpose of that one of the major purposes of the portfolio management on selling assets was to enable us to have the capital to profitably move from slower growing less productive assets in to plough into proven winters. But also to have the management to focus in time to think about fewer opportunities but bigger opportunities and really to focus on great developments and we\u2019re constantly on the lookout for those there will be, there is one that there is an addition of a new specialty anchor that will be coming at quarter mid-year in the next month or two that we\u2019ll be talking about not a huge capital spend but is a redevelopment of sorts an expansion of sorts and it\u2019s just in our DNA, our history is taking great properties great real-estate and then bringing them up to their full potential, so we're constantly on the lookout for that. Does that answer your question?"," ","Q - Haendel St. Juste"," ","Yes, it certainly gives me some color, some food for thought and just one more -- if I could follow up on some of the conversation earlier about bankruptcies. I'm looking at your lower lease term fee guidance for this year, $10 million versus $11.8 million last year. It seems to imply, obviously, fewer store closures. It seems a bit counterintuitive in the environment of higher retailer bankruptcies. I'm kind of curious the thought there. Is that because your current portfolio is a bit less exposed to weaker retailers, given some of your recent asset sales? Does that explain it?"," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Haendel that number is just really an average and it's hard to predict in fact when a tenant goes bankrupt you usually don\u2019t get a lease termination payment from them. They get to walk away. That comes when you are able to negotiate with a tenant who's still in business, but they're either reducing the amount of space they're taking and are not productive in your location. So again that's based on what we have seen in the last five years it's about the average of what we have seen it's not really indicative of the bankruptcies that we've talked about because typically there you don\u2019t get anything."," ","Q - Haendel St. Juste"," ","I appreciate the time."," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Thank you all."," ","A - Tom O'Hern"," ","Art we started a little bit late so if we can take one more."," ","Operator"," ","I will take another question from Christy McElroy from Citi."," ","Q - Michael Bilerman"," ","Hey it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Art, I recognize you sort of said you had nothing to share on the Simon rumors, but it's not every day that a competitor takes a 4% stake in another company and says they may ask for a waiver to go to 15%. So I guess, just from your perspective, how should we take it that you don't want to comment on it or take any questions on it? I think the market clearly has a pretty good understanding of your Company, given the Investor Day in November, the conference call today. So I'm just curious -- why not try to make a comment about it to sort of at least tell the market where things stand?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","Because that would involve speculation on my part about speculation it involves me speculating on what somebody else is thinking and that's a relatively dangerous endeavor."," ","Q - Michael Bilerman"," ","Well I guess then\u2026"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","And if you want to ask me about any of my actions and our Company's actions or our business or our prospects for our future, I'm happy to answer that in great detail, but it's really inappropriate for me to try and talk about what somebody else is thinking or doing?"," ","Q - Michael Bilerman"," ","Well, I guess the question is whether you have been engaged at all with them in those conversations or not, right? So if they have approached you for a waiver, do you give it to them or not? So those are things that, I guess, Macerich would do in terms of reaction to it and if you have had no reaction and no discussions, then that's fine. Then I would just want to know that as -- in the marketplace. I'm not asking for what Simon is doing; I'm asking sort of how you have reacted and what you have done about it, knowing that they have taken a stake?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","We've kept our focus on our business. We are 100% focused on our business and that's where we've been spending our time that's where we're going to spend our time and look I'd love to engage and chat about speculation but given the fact that I've already indicated I'm not going to talk about it this is my answer is really just consistent with the buzz kill announcement that I gave you at the beginning of my prepared remarks."," ","Q - Michael Bilerman"," ","Maybe just generally, in terms of how the Board -- you know, this is not the first time that there has been scuttle in the marketplace. I go back to 2003, 2004, I remember covering the stock, and there was a lot of chatter in the marketplace about strategic alternatives and things like that. Maybe just help us understand from a Board perspective how the Board looks in evaluating different things in creating shareholder value?"," ","A - Art Coppola"," ","I don\u2019t know that's probably more than one question but in any of that it's into the category of something that would be speculation and just not appropriate for me to comment on. I would say that if you look at the makeup of our Board we have a terrific Board. We have a very representative Board, a very thoughtful Board, a very sophisticated Board, there are a lot of adults in the room and they're connecting themselves historically as they should in protecting shareholder value back in 2009 they didn\u2019t panic like so many other companies did in sell survival equity they were very thoughtful about thinking about shareholders and they do that every meeting and every conversation."," ","Operator"," ","Well, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Art Coppola for closing or additional remarks."," ","End of Q&A"," ","Art Coppola"," ","Thank you. Again thank you for joining us as you can tell we're very proud of our results for 2014, again while it was not a transformational year maybe it was certainly a year where a lot of benchmarks were set and our view for the future is very-very bright and very-very positive and we look forward to sharing our thoughts about our business with you in the meetings that we'll be having with you over the balance of this year so thank you again for joining us."," ","Operator"," ","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's regulation G.

With that I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O'Hern","Thanks Jean and welcome everyone. Today we are going to be discussing the first Quarter results, capital activity and our outlook for 2012.","As we expected during the quarter fundamentals continued to improve. Retail sales had a strong increase and same-Center NOI was positive for the ninth quarter in a row. The re-leasing spreads showed double digit increases. Although occupancy dropped slightly, it remained at a very healthy level of 92.1%.","Leasing volume and spreads were both good. Leases signed during the quarter amounted to 216,000 square feet. The average new starting rent was $46.06 per foot. The average re-leasing spread on a trailing 12 month basis is 15.8%.","Average rent per square foot in the entire portfolio was up 5% to 45.87% compared to March 31st, 2011. Occupancy cost as a percentage of sales dropped to 12.9% compared to 13.5% a year ago.","Looking at the results for the quarter adjusted FFO, which excludes the impact of Valley View, was $0.76 per share, up from $0.52 per share in the first quarter 2011. The operating results were good including same-center NOI growth, excluding termination revenue and SFAS 141 income was 3.4% for the quarter. Lease termination revenue was up nearly $800,000 to $2.9 million. Bad debt expenses are up somewhat at $800,000 compared to $400,000 in the first quarter of last year.","With Management company expense and REIT G&A expense were down, Management company expense was down approximately $3 million to $22.5 million, and REIT G&A was down to $4.5 million compared to $7.6 million in the first quarter of last year. That was due to the first quarter of 2011 being usually high in both of those categories as there was a full years' worth of bonuses accrued in the first quarter of 2011.","Subsequent to that, bonuses are accrued throughout the year with 25% of the estimated amount booked in each quarter. That change accounts for the drop in both categories for both REIT-G&A and Management company expense.","During the quarter, we also booked an impairment loss on Valley View. Valley View has been a hands and loans service since mid-2010. On April 23rd, last week, it was sold for approximately $33 million and concurrently with the sale, the debt and all the accrued interest was forgiven. As of quarter end, because the sale price that was expected in April was less than our carrying value of $88 million we recorded a impairment write-down of $55 million in the first quarter of '12, that hits net income but not FFO.","Then in the second quarter we turned around, on April 23rd with the asset sale, we booked a gain on extinguishment of debt of $104 million. We have not included the impairment nor the gain on extinguishment of debt in our AFFO numbers. Valley View and the attached financial highlights of this morning's press release was included in discontinued operations.","Looking at our balance sheet, our debt to market cap at quarter-end was 42.3%. Net debt to EBITDA was 7.6 times and our interest coverage ratio is a very healthy 2.57 times. Looking at recent loan activity, in March we closed on a $140 million loan on Pacific View. That was a non-encumbered asset. We put a 10-year fixed rate financing in place at 4.08%. Also in March, we paid off $438 million of the remaining convertibles debentures. Those debentures are now paid in full.","During the quarter, we also put a $140 million bank construction loan on the Fashion Outlets of Chicago. That loan is extendable for a full maturity of five years and floats at LIBOR plus 2.50. In addition we received a commitment for $220 million of fixed rate financing on the Oaks. The new loan has a fixed rate of 4.11 and a 10-year term and we expect that to close within the next week or two.","In addition we are currently getting fixed rate quotes on Chesterfield and Rimrock, two currently unencumbered assets. The proceeds from those financings are estimated to be $160 to $180 million and those proceeds will be used to reduce floating rate debt on our line of credit. We also expect a significant amount of excess loan proceeds when we refinance Queens later this year and those proceeds will also be used to reduce outstandings on our line of credit. Excluding the loans that have built-in extension options, we only have $150 million of 2012 loan maturities remaining. In terms of FFO guidance in this morning's earnings release, we maintained our adjusted FFO per share guidance, with a range of 6-314. The guidance range excludes the impact of Valley View, both the impairment, as well as the gain on extinguishment of debt.","Although we beat guidance in the first quarter, we are not prepared to increase guidance at this time. We will readdress it after the second quarter.","Looking at tenant sales, tenant sales continued to improve. Mall tenant sales per foot for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st, 2012 came in at $504\/foot. That's up 12.3% compared to portfolio mall tenant sales per foot a year ago, which was $449.","At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Art.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you Tom, and welcome to our call. As you can see from the numbers, our leasing, rents and our same center NOI have had very good growth and continued good growth here over the last 5-6 quarters. The outlook is really quite strong on the leasing front and that's really buoyed by the fact that we have strong sales increases across the board, that we have a great product offering and that our centers are faced with very little impending competition.","Our occupancy levels will continue to improve over the course of the next year or so. One of the reasons that we have not seen spikes in occupancy is that we have been a little bit stingier in terms of the rents that we are willing to accept because we are in a very strong landlord oriented market today. I foresee this being a landlords' market for quite the foreseeable future. For me, the foreseeable future is the next 3-5 years.","There's been a lot of focus lately on cost of occupancies and sales trends with tenants, and while sales have been extremely good with tenants and while I'm thrilled to see comps center sales increases across the board, to me the more important story has been what I have been saying for the past six quarters, which is that the retailers have very strong operating margins.","When you multiply strong operating margins by strong sales levels and positive comp sales results, you find yourself a retailer who has cash on their balance sheet, they're making money and they're looking to expand their footprint and their store count across the board. That makes for a very strong leasing environment. We think that's an environment that we're going to be able to tap into for years to come.","Helping us to tap into that, I'd like to welcome to our executive team, as an Executive Vice President of Leasing at Macerich, Bobby Perlmutter, he's a well-known industry veteran. I've known Bobby and Eddie and I've known Bobby for 20 years now. He's got a long history, formerly running mall operations at Heitman Financial back in the 1990s when they had investments at up to 48 malls, and more recently is the managing partner and founder of Davis Street Properties, which he recently wound down. He joined us April 23rd. I see him helping us dramatically in terms of our merchandising of our centers.","That's really the key to the future for us because now we can begin to focus more so on merchandising, being more selective on the retailers that we accept so that we can drive sales to even greater levels by bringing in the most productive retailers from that results with the greater rents. Obviously that turns into greater same center analyzed as we move forward.","On the development front, things look great right now. Tyson's Corner continues to move along on target, and progress is very good there on the leasing front. We have nothing to announce in the office leasing. We talked about that in detail in our last call, but things aren't looking very good there.","Fashion Outlets of Chicago is well over 50% signed in executed leases, and the vast majority of the space has been committed to. We're looking at a fall of next year opening, and we're very excited about that. We are currently in the pre-leasing phase of the expansion, the 150,000 square foot or so expansion of Fashion Outlets of Niagara. That's being extremely well-received by retailers, and we see that opening also within the next two years.","During the quarter at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, the much awaited Neiman Marcus store opened there. Talking to the Neiman's folks, it's probably one of the most beautiful stores that they've ever built. It's a small edited version store, which is samatic to the trends in department stores today, which is to try and build more productive stores. It's just under a 90,000 foot store.","Other retailers of the center have seen huge sales increases as coincident with the entry of Neiman Marcus to the center. Nordstrom in particular has seen great increases by the introduction of Neiman, and this just further bolsters our confidence that we need to find a way to expand Broadway Plaza.","We're in talks with the city. We're in a critical juncture there in terms of looking at different ways to expand the center. When we have more details there, we will certainly share them with you. This is a great location, a great anchor line up, and we really see it as one of our next great centers.","During the quarter, a little bit of significant note actually, is that we purchased 500 North Michigan Avenue. That's an office building complex, which is contiguous to our North Bridge Mall in Chicago, downtown Chicago. The reason that we purchased this is that it is the missing link to the ownership that we have there of the square block bounded by Michigan Avenue. On the east Rush, on the west Illinois and Grand. It's the missing piece that the original developer had not been able to assemble. By buying this office building, we currently have plans to consolidate the first five levels of office space into a new three level, iconic, probably 40 to 45,000 square foot retail store with a possibility of integrating that store into Northbridge Mall. There's furthermore, the possible addition of an additional expansion to that retail location on the first level, just to the south of the 500 Michigan Avenue location, maybe a 20,000 foot anchor store.","When you're talking about Michigan Avenue, where street level rents are approaching $400 a square foot, and it's really enjoying a transformation. We think this is going to be a very important piece to the repositioning and taking of Northbridge Mall to the next level. Northbridge is a terrific mall, it's anchored by Nordstrom, it's been rumored that that's the number one Nordstrom in terms of sales in the United States. It has huge upside and the acquisition of 500 North Michigan is going to enable us to tap into that upside.","So we are very bullish on our operating fundamentals. We are very patiently working on expanding our footprint in our core markets; New York, D.C., Chicago, and the west coast. I'd like to open it up for questions at this point in time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Christy McElroy from UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS","Hi, good morning guys. Tom, I just wanted to go back to your guidance with regard to the first quarter you guided to roughly 21% of the full year, implying a rate of $0.64 to $0.66. Can you walk us through all the different factors that cause the actual result to be much higher than you expected? What was recurring versus non-recurring, and why wouldn't that then translate into a higher full year forecast?","Thomas O'Hern","Well there are a lot of factors Christy. One in particular is that we ended up with 3 million or so of lease termination revenue, and that's a number that, frankly, every year is a guess. When we look back on history, we had forecast 12 million, but we hadn't forecast any of it coming in the first quarter. So that's a piece of it. We had slightly higher SFAS 141 income as a result of some of the acquisition activity that we've had over the last nine months. Also some straight lining of rents, as a result of tenant changes which went our way. So, there were a few pickups there that may not be recurring. Remember, when we gave guidance, we also indicated that we would have asset sales in the range of 300 - 350 million, and we factored in some dilution there. It's too early to conclude one way or another on how that will go.","We've got roughly either closed or under contract $100 million of those sales, that's another part of it. We've also got quite a bit of financing in the works right now. We'll be in a much better position at the end of next quarter to address it, than we are at the end of just one quarter.","Christy McElroy - UBS","I think you had talked about in the last call $0.08 of dilution regarding the asset sales, is that something you will revisit next quarter as far as how much dilution you'll ultimately see?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Right, we'll take a look at all the major assumptions and do an update at that point.","Christy McElroy - UBS","You've talked about encumbering some of your unencumbered assets, I think a $2 billion pool you've talked about, do you have any restrictions on your unencumbered asset base in any of the covenants on your credit line?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No, none whatsoever, there's no requirement for an unencumbered pool.","Christy McElroy - UBS","With regard to Fashion Outlets of Chicago, can you talk about how the project economics will work with AWE Talisman. Are there any fees being paid to either party? What's the total project cost and what's your share in the construction line?","Arthur Coppola","Yeah, I think we've disclosed that in the past, but I'm happy to review that again. Our ownership in the project is 60% fee simple ownership today. We will be funding the equity component of the project and the loan is about $140 million. The total cost is around $200 million. We anticipate a double digit cash-on-cash return, and we have the right on a formula basis to look at buying out the 48% interest owned by AWE Talisman after a period of time. I think three years after the grand opening. We're very, very excited about the project and it's shaping up to be a terrific project.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Rich Moore, RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning, guys.","Another mall CEO this morning Art, said that there's a department store resurgent, do you see something similar going on as well?","Arthur Coppola","To look at all of our retailers, the retail environment is very healthy and that just goes across all sectors. It even includes the national retailers whether they be department stores or specialty stores. They've quit giving merchandise away, and they quit doing it the fall of March 2009. They gave up chasing sales and started chasing operating margins. When you go back and you make a secular change to your business model and you figure out how to make money again, you're going to have a resurgent. Yeah, there very healthy, all of our retailers across the board are in very good shape.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","The addition of a Neiman Marcus, that kind of thing, or similar department stores could appear more often in your portfolio you think?","Well, it has occurred on a non-recurring, recurring basis every year that we've done business. I mean we're constantly recycling and adding and subtracting and repositioning anchor stores. I'd hate to think of how many we've done over the past 35 years but it's a very large number. I bet we've recycled 40% of our anchor space in the last 15 years alone.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","All right. Okay, good. Thank you. When you think about densification. You know, the addition of office space and multi-family space that had gotten so much attention and then kind of resurged again. I mean, do you still find that to be a good idea in general? Are you going to be doing maybe more of that going forward?","Arthur Coppola","Right now our plans are limited to Tyson's Corner. That's it for now. But we clearly, we've got a great project in the works there and we're doing it for all the right reasons. It's adding 8,000 visitors per day to the customer base who live there or work there that are currently not there. It's going to be great for the mall. We're making money on each of the components. We just think that in a transit-oriented development, which this is as the rail comes to the site, that's it's appropriate. It's going to happen all around you so you might as well be a part of that. Not just be an old suburban mall stuck into the middle of a new central business core. That's really what drives it. It's not a panacea to go mixed juice but where it's appropriate and it's really the most appropriate where you have a transit oriented development.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you Art. Then Tom, real quick on the variable rate debt. I think it's around 50% at the end of the quarter of the debt portfolio. You mentioned some of the activities you're doing that will bring that down. Does that take you, you think, overall back to maybe the 20% level? That kind of...","Thomas O'Hern","I think by the time, Rich, by the time we get to the end of the year it's going to be under 20%. Subsequent to quarter end we had $140 million of proceeds that came in on Pacific View Financing. That was used to pay down variable rate debt. The Oaks, which I mentioned, is going to go from floating rate debt to fixed. That's $220 million. The excess proceeds on Queens, Queens Financing will be fixed and that will go to pay down floating. Almost every move we make on the financing front is going to be reducing the floating rate debt.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and most of these fixed rate loans probably in the 4% plus range, 4%-5%?","Thomas O'Hern","They're in the low fours Rich. They're in the very low fours. I don't think we've even done one over 4.25% lately. It continues to be a fantastic environment to be a borrower, especially fixed and long term.","Arthur Coppola","You can break 4%, you can get into the threes depending on your term.","Thomas O'Hern","Yeah, if you went for a five or a seven year deal you'd be under 4% easily today.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Thomas O'Hern","Thanks Rich.","Operator","The next question comes from Nathan Isbee from Stifel Nicolaus.","Thomas O'Hern","Hey Nathan.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning. How are you doing? Just another thing on the balance sheet. Long term debt is readily available but at the same time you do have quite a bit of activity. You have two projects in Chicago, Tysons, and Niagara. Are the asset sales going to be enough in your mind to keep that level in check or do you foresee things coming back to the equity bargains?","Thomas O'Hern ","No, I think if you look at the asset sales Nate, and then keep in mind we are not talking about developing into a five or five in a half percent return on cost. We are developing these projects with double digit returns, the value in the end is going to be a cap rate substantially below that. In the development of that nature there is an embedded piece of equity there that is not going to stretch our ratio, so the balance sheet is in great shape. I see no need to do that with the absent of any mid-draft position activity.","Arthur Coppola","Just to further our math, over the next three years are development activity on Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Niagara and Tysons, and those are really the only three that are clearly in our open to buy pipe line. Our total share of those of that outlay of dollars is not more than $400 million. When you have a $2 billion pool of unencumbered asset, that's why we created that pool was to create the fire power to fund new developments, redevelopments, expansions, so we are in very good shape. Our development pipeline is really self funded at this point in time.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus ","Okay, thanks. Having recently visited Desert Sky, I think it's finally understanding what you are trying to do there. Let's talk a little bit about how it's evolving at Desert Sky and the other malls that you plan to replicate and what is your long term view of these assets? Would you say that they're foreign and you would like to hold on to them or is it that you trying to get them to a certain place, perhaps package them and sell them off?","Arthur Coppola ","We are just trying to maximize the productivity and the profitability of centers that have more than 50 percent of their primary trade area servicing one ethnic group and in that particular case of Desert Sky as well as four other of our properties. We find ourselves with half a dozen properties or well over half of our primary trade area is Hispanic. We feel that centers that are located with that primary customer base need to be marketed different, they need to be leased differently, and operated differently then shopping malls in different demographic profiles.","I think we are learning a lot in terms of how we go about the marketing, the leasing, and the operating centers that are primarily located in Hispanic-ally dominated trade areas. To me, I would rather figure that out than expand my business operation to South America quite frankly. When you take half of the population growth in the United States in the next 40 years, it is going to come from that segment of our population. It is the fastest growing and probably what has the highest disposable income. It's really good business sense to try to figure out a way to maximize your productivity in those markets given our base.","Again in southern California, given this is the melting pot of the world, we are constantly learning how to cater to different ethnic groups. In Cerritos we think about how can we cater best to the Asian predominance and population that we have there. In Queens we try to figure out how cater best to the 89 different language speaking groups that are in our immediate trade area. The main paradigm is being in touch with your customer, and that's just all we're trying to do at Desert Sky.","Where we go with it in terms of core and non-core is unknown. Because personally I believe in that business. I believe that there's great upside there. I believe that there is an opportunity, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. You cannot ignore as an owner the fact that 50% of the growth and population in the United States is going to be Hispanic-based in the next 40 years. You cannot ignore that. One would be foolish to ignore it.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Do you get any sense from the national retailers that they're taking a fresh look at that mall now that you've actually changed it a little bit?","Arthur Coppola ","Yes, we're actually educating them. I met with a CEO of a national retailer recently and I said, \"You know, we do really well in our Hispanic trade areas.\" He says, \"Yes, I know we do. That's our largest customer base.\" And I said, \"Your real estate and research people don't know that.\" He said, \"Yes, I know. I need to help educate them to that.\" But there's a whole bunch of retailers that do particularly well in that particular demographic segment. So yes, people like Vans, Aeropostale, Journey. There are a whole bunch of retailers that do particularly well, and we're going to populate our centers with those folks. A lot of it though is marketing. We have a whole different marketing calendar in centers like Desert Sky. It's really just being in touch with our community. That's all.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then if you just look at the Phoenix area mall in your portfolio. Where are sales today versus where they were pre-crash?","Arthur Coppola","Do you have that handy?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Yes. We have caught up with pre-crash as we've mentioned on the prior calls. Phoenix is one of our best markets in terms of sales growth, and that continued to be the case in the first quarter. The Arizona market which is predominantly Phoenix for us, the Arizona region was up 9.4%.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Do you know what that is on just a dollar basis?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Not off the top of my head, Nate.","Arthur Coppola","I'm sure it's in excess of 2007 sales levels in Arizona, because for Arizona the crash really started in late spring of '08.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","All right, thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Yes, hi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of the Michigan Avenue office building purchase. How much did it cost? When did you buy it? Anything else on economics you can give us?","Arthur Coppola","Sure, we paid $70 million for it and we bought it February 29th of this year. And we bought it at between 6% and 7% going in return. The opportunity here is really to reposition that first five levels of office building space into three levels of retail. So, we're going to increase the ceiling heights and create a really iconic retail location there. And our belief that the real opportunity here is to take a retail store of linear frontage, all the way from Grand Avenue to Illinois. And have one continuous, seamless retail store front there, on Michigan Avenue that we can offer to retailers. Our belief is that we'll get more rent out of the first 45,000 feet of this 324,000 foot office building, in net operating income than we got from the entire building when we bought the building. And then we'll have basically bought the top 15 floors, not for free, but that will be gravy. And long time, after we carve out the retail street retail component, condominimize the building and sell off the upper office levels off to a natural office user. We bought the building to get our hands on the street retail and to turn it into street retail.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay.","Arthur Coppola","That's a retail store that we're currently showing to retailers today. So it could easily be something that retailer, it's going to be an iconic retailer most likely. It's going to be a flag ship most likely, there's a lot of flag ships being created on Michigan Avenue. Burberry is building a new 5-story building, Top Shop just came, All Saints just came. There's a whole bunch of retails doing major stores on the street there. It wouldn't be out of the question for that store to be open in 18 months-2 years. But, depending on how big of an integration that we try and accomplish between that building and the mall. There's one plan that we have that actually takes that office building and has it seamlessly integrated into the mall itself, so that's a possibility.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay.","Arthur Coppola","The dollars are not that great actually because we moved very quickly on that of that acquisition. And our partner in the Alaska Permanent Fund in the mall, we've offered them the right to be our partner in it, which undoubtedly they'll take us up on. And the total redevelopment dollars to create this street front retail opportunity and repositioning is less than $25 million. So our half of that, is half of that kind of number. So it's not a huge capital event, but it's a very big repositioning event, profit event.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. And then maybe switching gear again on the asset sales going back to that. You closed at $65 million. I think Tom mentioned you have $100 million that's closed or underway so it sounds like another $35 million is in the works. I mean should we think about with the initial target being $300 million to $350 million, does it still feel like you'll end up doing that this year?","Arthur Coppola","Yes.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay. Okay. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","And the balance of that pipeline will likely close in the second quarter and we'll disclose those events as they occur.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. And last question. I mean the reported leasing spreads have been ticking up each of the past few quarters. And color or commentary in terms of what you're seeing and signing toady relative prior to the 12-month rolling levels of about 16%? Is it comparable? Is it still ticking up?","Arthur Coppola","The numbers, you always have to be careful of. The quality of leasing and the pace of the leasing and the interest levels that we've got is extremely strong. So on a color viewpoint, on a qualitative viewpoint, it's very strong. Sometimes a 12% leasing spread if it's up against some huge rents that a re experiencing, can be more impressive than a 20% leasing spread against some more modest rents. But look, over the past 18 months the leasing environment has improved dramatically. It is very strong right now and I see no reason that it's going to be anything other than very strong for the next three to five years.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And moving next we'll go to Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Arthur Coppola","Hey Craig.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Given Vornado's statement that everything is on the table, I wondered if you would say is there an interest on your part looking their mall portfolio and in particular I'm thinking of Green Acres Mall.","Arthur Coppola","Well, they have some properties that are in the markets that we have indicated that we would like to expand our presence. Clearly their in the greater New York area. It's no secret that we love doing business in the boroughs of New York. And that's a high priority for growth for our company. We talked about that actually in our shareholders letter 14 months ago that we were going to be primarily on Chicago, New York, DC, LA, and San Francisco, and Arizona for our growth opportunities. We've been delivering on our growth in those markets over the past 14 months and we see great opportunities to grow in those markets in the future and that could be part of it. Look, we have a, we love doing business in melting pots. My office, our office is here in the center of the melting pot of the world, Los Angeles. We know how to do business in melting pots and certainly centers that Vornado owns kind of fits that demographic profile.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great and do you know off hand the size of the Neiman Marcus at Broadway?","Arthur Coppola","88,000 feet.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Quentin Velleley from Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Hi, how are you?","Arthur Coppola","Hi Quentin.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Just in terms of the, going back to floating rate debt and the line of credit, which I think about $800 million drawn now that you've bought back to convert. How should we think about where that line balance is sort of going to be by the end of the year? If you put in the unencumbered assets that you're putting mortgages against at the moment, some excess proceeds in the asset sales. Will the loan sort of be down to about $300 million by the end of the year? Is that a fair assumption?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Only if Art goes out and buys something. It should be a lot lower than that Quentin. It's at $640 today because we used the cash that was on the balance sheet at quarter end [from Pacific View to pay that down. We could generate $180 million or so from Chesterfield and Rimrock refinancing. That will take it down to under $500 million. As we mentioned, we've got asset sales planned for the year. The excess proceeds there we'd use. I'd say comfortably and conservatively we'll be under $200 million by year end.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Then maybe if we just go back to 500 North Michigan, where are you holding that out on the balance sheet? Is that in CIP because I think CIP went up by about $100 million over the quarter?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No, it's not in CIP. CIP, the change in CIP is primarily for Fashion Outlets in Chicago because construction started on that.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Got it. And then with 500 North Michigan, the office tenants in there, are there development clauses in their leases? Is it a simple exercise to get them to exit the building or is there some more work that needs to go in there?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, nothing's ever simple. But it's manageable.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. Then, just lastly, in terms of Valley View, I think it was a $2.6 million negative impact on FFO in the quarter. Just for NAV purposes can you break out what the NOI was that you got for Valley View in the quarter?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","NOI has been running negative, Quentin. I think it's running roughly $500,000 negative a quarter.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hey Paul.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Do you have the rest of the regional break out for sales?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Yeah, we've got most of it here. As I said Arizona was 9.5%, Southern California was 15.9%, Northern California about 8%, central region 13.4%, and eastern region was at the low level of 7.2%. That was the range. Southern California being the high, eastern being the low and everything else in between.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Anything in particular, you have got quite a bit down there in Southern California, any particular striving at 16%?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Santa Monica Place.","Arthur Coppola","Well, that is really across the board though, you have got the Oaks' doing really well, Cerritos is on fire, we have had double-digit increases there at Cerritos, but it is really across the board.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","The thing about the spreads is you guys present your spreads quite conservatively and not everybody does it the exact same way. Do you have the GAP spreads as well?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No, we really don't look at that Paul because we are moving towards all of our leases being on CPI anyway. It would obviously expand that because of the effect of the straight lining of rents would make that spread even wider but it is not something that we track internally. We switched 8 years ago to structuring our leases with CPI increases and so straight lining of rent has been a dwindling number for us over the past 4, 5 or 6 years.","Arthur Coppola","We basically traded annual CPIs for stepped rents and had we remained with all of our leases being stepped rents, if you think about it, back in the day and probably today, the average step rents have rents going up 20% over the course of a new 10 year deal, say 10% or more during the first 5 years and another 10% somewhere else. So if we still had those types, that lease structure, I think if I do the math correctly it seems to me that our spreads would be 10% higher across the board. But we do not do that.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Do you look at it on a gross basis like some folks do too?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No, this is the minimum rent versus expiring minimum rent.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Okay. I guess that is it for me. Everything else is taken care of. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take the next question from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. First question; on the construction loan at the Chicago Outlets, we have not seen a whole lot of construction financing for large projects like this, particularly an outlet and I was just wondering what the demand was like from the lending community for that financing and whether or not you expect to see more construction financing becoming available for outlet space overall from the banks today?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well Todd, I think it is a function of the strength of the sponsor in the project.","Arthur Coppola","And the leasing status of the project. We are not going to comment on the state of outlet financing across the board. We are only going to comment on that one project.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","But it was led by two very strong banks that are part of our line group. It was a typical construction loan and they were very happy to get involved with the project. As Art said, it was over 50% pre-leased and even higher than that in terms of what has been committed so it is a good loan from the bank's standpoint and I we are happy to move forward with that.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Then based on what retailers are telling you and what you're seeing, are you still projecting sales at the outlet center to be $800 a square foot or an excess of that?","Arthur Coppola","We're not going to project that today but we think it's going to be a very, very strong center in those type of sales results as it matures are clearly, in my view, possible.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Then just as you mentioned, Queens Center is also a refinancing opportunity.","I was just wondering, that loan has a March 2013 maturity date, when is that open for prepayment?","Arthur Coppola","That opens up later this year for prepayment.","We are in conversations with the existing lender today, who's got an interest in taking a look at that early.","Its spots are by a life insurance company so we have the ability to talk to them about a blend and extend program where you extend the loan and increase the size early, without getting into the old maintenance issues.","That's the nice thing that you get when you're dealing with lenders that you can talk to, as opposed to publicly securitized debt.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Then just lastly, I was just wondering, we've heard a lot about the warmer weather both impacting expenses and also sort of tenant sales during the quarters as consumers may have been sort of out and about a little bit more.","Any evidence that the warmer winter poled fall or demand that we may see that trend sort of reverse a little bit in April or May?","Arthur Coppola","No.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank You.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co.","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Arthur Coppola","Hey Tayo.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co.","Quick question on the outlet center space.","Given all the competition and the space, wondering how you guys are assessing in an opportunity for you guys to build your portfolio.","Arthur Coppola","Sure. Yeah, when we announced that we would be entering into the outlet space, we said that we were going to only be pursuing locations that we felt had the opportunity to be dominant centers in the space.","Since we restricted ourselves to that type of quality profile, we indicated that look, if we own five or seven outlet centers after five years into this program, that would be success.","I would say that is probably still the way we view it. That if we own five or seven, or a few more strong outlet centers after our first five years of introduction into the outlet arena that I would be very happy with our status.","We're certainly in no race for size, or in no race to deliver. We think that it's a natural compliment to our core businesses, but our goal in being involved in the outlet arena is to be involved with what we view as core type of projects. We have pretty modest expectations on the outlet side. But the nice thing about a company that is big enough to matter, like we are, but still small enough to be nimble and to move the needle is that you add five strong outlet centers to a portfolio of our size, that moves the needle very considerably over a period of five years.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co.","That's helpful. Could you give us a sense of what kind of markets in general would kind of meet your definition of a market you would be interested in?","Arthur Coppola","The starting point is the markets that we currently are strongly interested in. Which is the West Coast, the East Coast, Chicago, and Arizona.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co.","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Ben Yang from KBW.","Ben Yang - KBW","Yeah, hi. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Hi.","Ben Yang - KBW","Hi, how you doing? Art, you made a comment that the development front looks great and you talk about some of your near term plans but you did not mention Phoenix. But at the same time you also talked about sales in this market coming back pretty strong. It seems like round up development here might be only a matter of time. I was hoping you could just remind us first how much land you own or control in and around Phoenix and then maybe if you had any thoughts on what this land is worth today and even how investors should think about valuing this opportunity for you guys.","Arthur Coppola","Well, we have control of land in different pockets. Sometimes we have options on land. Sometimes we own the land, like we own the land for the new mall that we'd like to build in West Phoenix in Goodyear. We own that land. It's at a fairly nominal cost there. We do not have, we have not announced an opening date for that. We own land in North Scottsdale, on Scottsdale Road in the 101. We have not announced any plans for construction there. We own land north of Tucson, between Tucson and Phoenix in Murano.","These are parts of the growth corridors in Phoenix. But until we announce that we're coming out of the ground I would not try and monetize those land positions in terms of the way you view that land. As we announce the projects the value of the land will be evident in the overall returns, the expectations that we expect to see. We own all of the land that we own free and clear. We don't owe any money against any of it, I don't think. Right, Tom? We own it all free and clear.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Correct.","Arthur Coppola","It's a non-income producing asset that we think will serve us well in the years to come. We think we own the right land in the right locations. But we are committed to the idea of only building when we think it is time to build. When you have a market like Phoenix where you control the best land you're in no rush to build something before it's time. We're not going to build projects in Phoenix before their time.","Ben Yang - KBW","Got it. I mean, it just seems like maybe a few years from now it could be the most interesting part of your story. I mean, it's 1000 acres or even more than that? Is that the opportunity that's in front of you guys, obviously several years down the road?","Arthur Coppola","It's less than 500 acres total. It's a full site in west Phoenix. It's a full site in north Scottsdale. There's other land holdings that we have that would serve smaller developments, but those are the primary sites that we've got. We control land in different ways. We have a right of first refusal on 2000 acres of land on the west side of Scottsdale Road and the 101. It's nothing to have that right of first refusal on state owned land.","Ben Yang - KBW","You said 2000 acres?","Arthur Coppola","2000 acres.","Ben Yang - KBW","Okay. That's helpful. And a final one on the balance sheet, is there any reason your average maturity on your debt hasn't really moved over the past few years? It's kind of still where it was before the crisis and much lower than what your peers are reporting. Do you guys report maturities excluding extension options or is there maybe something else kind of holding you back from pushing maturities out even further?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well that's what we're in the midst of now, and most of the debt that we put in place in 2008, was three, extendable to four, or five years. We have that group of finances that we're working through right now. I mentioned Queens is going to be financed here shortly. The Oaks is one of those loans initiated in '08, that's going to close in the next couple of weeks. You will gradually start seeing our maturities schedule lengthen over the course of the next 12 months pretty significantly.","Ben Yang - KBW","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will take the next question from Alexander Goldfarb, from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning out there, and thank you. Just Tom, along those lines, on Queen center and North Park, those are two loans that are coming up. I'm sort of curious on Queen center just given what seemed to be a bit under levered. Should we think about something in the $5, $600 million range on a refi or possibly bigger?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","I think in the range of 6 is in the ball park, Alex. You're right, it is very under leveraged today.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","What about North Park, again I would assume the same thing sort of applies there. What should we think about?","Arthur Coppola","On that one I wouldn't put anything into your modeling other than the loan will get extended at current levels.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Is there sort of an unencumbered minimum that you guys want to maintain?","Arthur Coppola","No, we just think that having an unencumbered pool is something that we'd never enjoyed until the last two or three years, and we created that pool through the liquidities events that we have had over the last two or three years. It's just a very efficient way to fund future development and redevelopment and acquisition opportunities. It doesn't cost you anything to have the pool unencumbered. Having a line of credit has a standby feature that's attended to that. We just think it's a great source of fire power for us. It's self imposed. The idea that we want to have an unencumbered goal. Four years ago, I'll bet we didn't have $200 million of unencumbered as. Today we got $2 billion.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","But Art, I'm not talking like some sort of covenant but I'm just talking some sort of an internal management. Like, \"hey, we want to have a billion. We want to have a billion and a half.\" Something like that.","Arthur Coppola","No, we don't any specific self imposed minimums. We've decided to build up a encumbered pool a year or so ago because we knew it would be a great source of capital to fund our development pipeline and so we did it.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And just final question. Tom, this is sort of going back to Christie question at the beginning, in the income statement a lot of the lines seemed to move around. Was there anything that happened from bringing on the unwind of Simon JV assets that changed any of the individual lines on the income statement.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, they went from being unconsolidated joint ventures to being consolidated entities so they moved up to the same lines that you would see for other wholly owned assets. So yeah, they all changed.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","No, I know that, but I was wondering if there was any reclassification or anything like that occurred?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","No.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thanks.","Operator","And today's last question will come from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Good morning.","Arthur Coppola","Good morning.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","I just wanted to go back to some of your comments on retailer margins Art. When you look at let's say sales for activity over the last year or so and you look at what [inaudible] there were margins, do you think today both to charge more from an occupancy cost ratio from a percentage of sales that has generated by those retailer than you were able to do so a year or two years ago?","Arthur Coppola","Yes.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","If you were to separate that from let's the $600 a foot, or $700 a foot model versus the $300 or $400 a foot. By how much would that margin end differ?","Arthur Coppola","Actually, I don't think there's a great difference. I was looking at those number yesterday and I was actually please to see that leasing spreads at our lower proxy models were as healthy as the higher productivity models in the last three to six months.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","But if you look at let's say a market ramp over the last year instead of free leasing spread, which is more over the last five to seven years, how would you gauge the improvement at the $300 or $400 foot versus $600 to $700 a foot?","Arthur Coppola","Good. I would gauge the improvement to be good. You've got retailers are willing to consider some of the lower productivity models today because of the of supply when they couple their own internal demand needs and the lack of supply available to them after they run through the top 200 models in the United States. They have no choice but to then look into lower productivity centers that are still very well anchored, very well located, and many times monopolistic in nature and so the level of appetite from retailers in those locations is good and certainly better than it was a year ago.","And I have to say Cedrik that the piece that your firm did on operating margins, I thought was one of the more thoughtful pieces that I've seen recently because you are focusing on not just sales per foot but operating margins. And so that applies to the $300 a foot centers as much as $700 a foot centers. Remember that if the retailer is making money, then he's making money in the $300 a foot center also. And that is evidencing itself in terms of the demand that we are getting and the deals that we are making in those centers.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Great. Thanks for positive feedback and thanks for the answer.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question and answer session. Id like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Arthur Coppola","All right, well thank you so much for joining us and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming industry events over the next month or so. Thank you so much.","Operator","That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"13956":["Macerich Co.

Welcome to today\u2019s Macerich Company Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder today\u2019s conference is being. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to the variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.","We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC which are posted in the Investor section of the company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Robert Perlmutter, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you, Jean. The fourth quarter reflected continued solid operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolios key operating metrics. FFO was $1.17 per share compared to $1.12 for the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year FFO per share was $4.07, which was at the midpoint of our initial guidance after factoring in the dilutions from the Capitola sale, which was not part of our original guidance.","Same-center NOI in the fourth quarter excluding straight lining rent and SFAS 141 income was up 2.1% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in this growth rate compared to earlier in 2016 as discussed on the last call was expected due to the occupancy losses from tenant bankruptcies and the tough comparison of the fourth quarter of \u201815 which grew to 6.4% clip.","Same-center NOI for the year was at 5%, which is up the top 10 of our guidance range. Gross margin on a same-center basis for the quarter were 70.5% down from 70.9% in the fourth quarter of \u201815, occupancy declines were the primary reason for that decline, full year 2016 gross margin was 69.7%, up 45 basis points from 69.25% in 2015.","The CAM expense recovery rate including joint ventures of pro rata was at 95% from 2016 and that was down from 103% in 2015. A significant factor in that decline in addition to the occupancy losses was the change in the portfolio of composition in 2015, which included the full year impact of the new Tysons Corner Hotel, Tysons Apartment Tower Tysons Office Building all of which incurred significant operating expenses and have no related recoveries.","We expect the recovery rate of 2017 to be similar to 2016. If you look at the recovery rate for 2016 without the Tysons Building it was 99.5%.","Bad debt expense for the quarter was $1.4 million, up slightly from $1 million in the fourth quarter of \u201815, lease termination fees were $4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of \u201815.","During the fourth quarter average interest rate was 3.56% down slightly from a year ago when it was 3.6%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end our balance sheet metrics included debt-to-market cap at 40.8% and interest coverage ratio of 3.8 times, which is the best in our company's history, and an average debt maturity of 6.3 years.","The financing market for us remains very good and even as rates have increased the borrowing spreads have decreased and we're still able to get 10 year fixed rate loans at less than 4%. Couple of examples of this includes on October 6th we closed on a $325 million financing of the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair, the CMBS loan on this is a 10 year fixed rate loan with an interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from this financing reached to pay down our line of credit.","In addition in February of this year we committed to a $225 million loan on Kierland Commons. That's a 10 year financing that we expect to close in March and has a coupon of 3.95%. During 2016 the company closed on $1.8 billion of fixed rate mortgages with an average loan amount of $300 million.","So the high quality assets the financings were very attractive the average term was 11.1 years and the average interest rate on that $1.8 billion of financings was 3.79%. After Kierland we do not have much in front of us in terms of loans maturing in the next two years. We have only $99 million maturing in 2017 and $400 million in 2018.","In the press release last night we issued our guidance of $3.90 to $4 a share per FFO, included the guidance is $0.08 of dilution from the January 2017 sale of Northgate Mall and Cascade Mall in an additional loan of core asset that's currently under contract. No other 2017 dispositions or acquisitions are included in guidance.","Other major assumptions include as we mentioned on the last earnings call and we have not changed that we are forecasting for 2017 a same-center NOI rate of 3.0% to 4%. This factors in on average about 100 basis of occupancy loss versus '16 and factors in the closure of both The Limited and Wet Seal as Bob will talk about in a few minutes.","Some of the factors impacting the comparison of FFO projected for 2017 compared to actual 2016 include in the case of Kings Plaza it's a great long-term move for Kings Plaza yearly termination Sears, but it did cause temporary loss of rent and other charges including non-cash items of about $0.11 a share.","The impact of long-term fixed rate financing which resulted in paying down short-term floating rate debt as well as an assumed increase in the LIBOR rate for 2017 resulted in an impact, negative impact in 2017 guidance of about $0.08 a share.","These financings continue to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our debt maturity schedule with the negative being earnings impact. We also are projecting no land sales in 2017 versus 2016, which is about a $0.03 a share negative impact.","The quarterly split we're projecting an FFO was 21% of our FFO for the year to be in the first quarter 23% in the second quarter 26% in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Leasing within the Macerich portfolio generated solid fourth quarter results capping a productive year in 2016. Our trailing 12 month leasing spreads increased to 17.7% from the third quarter rate of 16.1%. The increase in spreads was generated with above average performance at the higher productivity centers.","Average rent for lease signed during the trailing 12 month period was $56.57 per square foot, up marginally from the third quarter. During the fourth quarter a total of 962,000 square feet of leases were signed. This represented a 20% increase from the previous quarter. This increase was primarily the result of a number of large renewal packages completed in the fourth quarter. The average term for leases signed in the fourth quarter was 5.2 years.","Occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 95.4%. This represented a 10 basis point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And our temporary occupancy ended the fourth quarter at 5.2%. As we\u2019ve talked in the past occupancy at the centers continues to be impacted by bankruptcies and early lease terminations. These bankruptcies often present opportunities to secure more productive and more contemporary tenants that will generate higher sales productivity and increased revenues in the coming year. They do however cause some short-term vacancies of the properties.","Our portfolio sales ended 2016 in $630 per square foot. This represented a 0.7% decrease on a year-over-year basis. On a same center basis in 2016 sales were $650 per square foot and this represented a 1.1% increase for the year.","Fourth quarter sales were supported by a strong December when total sales increased by 1.7% and comparable sales were up 2.1%. Recently, The Limited and Wet Seal declared bankruptcy and announced they will liquidate their remaining store locations. Within our portfolio we have 15 stores with The Limited totaling 74,000 square feet, but generating only $240 per square foot in sales.","The average gross rent for these 15 stores was $65.04 per square foot. Their store locations are in some of our best quality centers. To-date we've completed deals on five of these locations totaling 25,000 square feet. We have nine stores with Wet Seal totaling 38,000 square feet and generating $250 per square foot in sales.","The average gross rent for these nine stores was $68.42 per square foot. Similar to The Limited, Wet Seal is located in number of our better quality centers having elected to keep these locations during their bankruptcy less than two years ago.","To-date, we have completed deals on two of these locations totaling 8,500 square feet. As a side note, in 2012 we had 32 stores with Wet Seal, combined we have released 33,500 square feet or approximately 30% of these spaces. The blended in place rents were $70.95 per square foot gross. The new starting rents are equal to $81.01 per square foot gross. This is a 14.2% increase.","So let me conclude we are very pleased with the composition of our shopping center portfolio. We believe these centers represent important locations for retailers seeking a national brick and motor platform, including locations in many important gateway cities.","We see further opportunities in leasing by; one, continuing to attract new mall based retailers; two, maintaining and expanding our most successful mall tenants; three, consolidating retailers and use its historically located near, but outside the mall; and lastly by securing new food entertainment, health and mixed use opportunities.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks Bob. Thanks Tom. As you can see from our report, all over operating fundamentals remain extremely solid, as they have over the past year and our outlook on all of our fundamentals for the upcoming year remain extremely solid. With the past year as I think about what we've accomplished, we've come a very long way, the game plan that we outlined going back about a year to 15 months ago has been executed with major part of that game plan being very large joint ventures that we completed with the subsequent, very efficient buyback of stock in the beginning part of 2016.","In my comments I\u2019d like to talk about a couple of disconnects that I see that had been brought up to me from investors in particular over the past couple of months. One of them relates to the disconnect that some investors have and that we have on the future prospects for re-leasing spreads is the mark-to-market positive.","Are we going to be able to maintain positive re-leasing spreads, and the other one relates to what\u2019s happening with private market valuation, but first of all let me focus on re-leasing spreads. As you know over the past 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years that we've been a public company, we have reported our re-leasing spreads every quarter and every quarter they\u2019re in the mid-teens in a positive way.","And people legitimately can ask the question that would be essentially a hypothesis, which is that well, we hear from certain retailers that mall traffic is down. We therefore expect that comp sales are going to not be robust and if that\u2019s the case then at some point in time re-leasing spreads have to come down to a much more moderate or even flat level. And that line of thinking would be valid except for the assumptions that are in the question are not valid. First of all traffic is not down in well located centers. In fact we have many cases where it's up significantly.","Secondly the whole thesis that comp sales themselves should be a leading indicator of re-leasing spreads is not bounded on firm ground and let me give you some numbers. As you know we're the only mall company that publishes our sales per foot by property and have done so basically over the past seven years. So you get seven years of history. If you take a look at the seven years of history that we've reported to you on our portfolio you're going to see that only on a comp center basis and I'm only talking comp centers meaning the centers that we owned in 2009 that we still own in 2016.","Looking at that alone that portfolio of comp centers has gone up in sales per foot 37% over the past seven years, which doesn't rain true to the comp sales increases that we report every quarter and every year. The CAGR growth in terms of sales per foot productivity on a comp center basis and then on a total center basis in our portfolio has been roughly 5%, 6% a year and certainly if we've been reporting comp sales increases of 5% a year would all be ambulant.","The reason and the second number I want to share with you is that if you go back and you look at our ABRs our Average Base Rentals that were in place seven years ago, they were $40.67 a year and at the end of '16 it was $54.87. So let's just take a look at that, sales per foot over the past seven years in our portfolio on a comp center basis have gone up 37%. That translates to average base rents going up 35%.","So the old saying that rent is a function of sales seems to be pretty correlated here. But how is it that those sales per foot went up in total when in fact on a comp basis if you take a look at every tenant that was in business back in '09 it didn't go up on that level.","And the answer is simple, remember earlier in the year we talked about the opportunity for re-leasing spreads that is generated by constantly individual and taking the tenants that are your bottom 35% to 40% producers and replacing them with tenants that can do better than the mall average. And that is exactly what we have done and that is exactly what other folks that own great centers like we own are able to do.","And this is why we have been able to produce these re-leasing spreads that for the past year again are in the mid-teens. And as we even look at the mark-to-markets and we look at bankrupt tenants, we continue to see that kind of opportunity going forward.","So I'm happy to talk you further if you would like on the re-leasing spreads that there is absolute foundation for the opportunity for these spreads to continue. And by the way, even though our sales productivity has gone up 35% in seven years and our base rents have gone up 37% in five years. Our cost of occupancy as a percentage of sales is actually gone down from 14.2% to 13.4% in the last seven years. So that again gives us room for growth.","The second disconnect that I want to talk about the people seem to be and this is really frankly quite shocking to me. This seems to be focused on - there seems to be a perception that private market valuations of class A Fortress [ph] regional malls have somehow changed in a negative way in the last few months. And I can tell you that that disconnect of absolutely not founded in fact.","We have gone and talked to folks that we recently transacted with on major joint ventures and said to them so on an anecdotal basis would you have capital, would you be interested in doing a deal at those kind of cap rates and those kind of multiples today just as you did a year ago? And the answer comes back a resounding yes.","You look at the absolute - we have an absolute pause on where the values are on Class A regional malls and you look at that and you talk to folks and the believe that values have come down just doesn\u2019t right true. Now, one of the reasons that people believe that values may have come down is because of the prospect of rising interest rate.","And I can tell you that other than shocking increases in interest rate, an interest rate that go up for reason that are not - that reflect something bad in the economy that there is very little correlation certainly between interest rate and cap rates for Class A regional malls.","In my own experience so long is interest rates the long-term interest rate still remain below the cap rates that tend not to have much impact on the cap rates. And you have to think about also well look what is that is causing describing interest rates to go up.","And I believe there is a general perception that one of the reasons that the fed and other are raising rates and they believe rates are going to go up is that they believe that inflation, which has been non-exist for the past 10 years my begin to come back into the picture. And I can assure you that inflation is the friend of a regional shopping center owner.","And the final thing just if you want to think about it from a micro view point, over a very long period of time, I saw steady I wish I could reference it for you, but it measure rent growth for all the different product types on a global basis and the two product types that over a past 30 to 40 years showed the strongest rent growth was high street retail and Class A fortress malls.","And when you think about that and you think about Class A fortress malls in particular in the United States the pool of assets that is available for folks to invest in is not increasing and the ownership is consolidated in the hands of the people that are not going to sell them.","And yet the capital that's available and that has an appetite to invest in them just grows over periods of time, it remains constant and the pool of capital that would be interested in tapping into co-investing with owners like ourselves and are peers that only Class A regional malls gets deeper every day for many, many different reasons.","I now want to move over to just comment on dispositions. So the past 14 months with the sale of Panorama and Capitola and recently Northgate and Cascade we\u2019ve sold another four malls we\u2019ve generated $368 million of proceeds from them those malls have sales of roughly $3.60 a foot.","You look back over the past five years that means roughly 20 malls that we\u2019ve sold that we\u2019re generating sales of roughly $3.35 a foot in total and helped us to generate proceeds of $1.8 billion. And we absolutely believe that what we have been doing and that we are doing in terms of pruning our portfolio and in many times putting the properties in to the hands of a buyers that can focus on it in a more entrepreneurial way then we have. That doing all of this has been very prudent.","But look it doesn\u2019t come without an impact on earnings that\u2019s obvious, if you take a look at $1.8 billion of dispositions over the past five years then you assume an average cap rate of 7%, 7.5% whatever number you want to put on that and you assume that the money in the mean team goes to pay down debt or gets reinvested. Over a period of five years that adds up to $0.50, $0.60 a share of dilution in earnings any way you slice, but it positions the company for above average same center growth which we achieved very good growth in 2016. Look we\u2019re trying to be realistic about our growth prospects for 2017, but it has positioned our portfolio and our balance sheet for a very, very bright future.","And if I think about dispositions, that brings me to the issue of department stores. In the recent store closing announcements from Macy\u2019s and Sears we were fortunate to basically not have any surprises, we have one location which was [indiscernible] which we knew about that was going to be sold by Macy\u2019s and I believe that has been done. But the department stores need to take a page out of the book that folks like we have where we are pruning assets that are not core to our fundamental business. And then we are taking that money and we are reinvesting that into our core business and that\u2019s what the department stores need to do and hopefully that\u2019s what they will do.","So we expect more closings over a period over time and we do see it as an opportunity for a net positive for the retailer, if they redeploy that money into their core business and certainly from our view point, we see this a net positive as we get back supply of space that we can utilize to bring in either other department stores or other uses that can generate traffic that will increase the overall sales productivity of the center and obviously result in ever increasing re-leasing spreads and same center growth.","So with that I\u2019d like to welcome the call and open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We ask that you limit yourself to two questions and then if you have any additional questions you may re-queue that way everyone have an opportunity to signal for a question. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Todd.","Todd Thomas","Hi, good morning. So first question for Bob, regarding the outlook for store closures and bankruptcies, how is it played out so far relative to your expectations? And then any changes to your outlook around retailer bankruptcies and closures in \u201817, just relative to what you were thinking or seeing over the last few months?","Robert Perlmutter","I don\u2019t think we've seen any change in our thinking, the two bankruptcies that occurred so far again we're not surprising especially Wet Seal who had been through bankruptcy about 18 months ago, when you look at their sales productivity, it was clear that they were candidates. I think if anything, the nature is changing a little bit in the sense that these changes are a little bit smaller than some of the change that we saw in 2016 in terms of their store plates.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then the 100 basis points of occupancy loss that Tom mentioned that\u2019s embedded in guidance, how much of that\u2019s already baked in versus what speculative and then for the Wet Seal and Limited stores that you\u2019ve already re-leased, can you speak to some of the retailers that have taken some of that space?","Robert Perlmutter","I\u2019d prefer not to talk about the retailers, but generally what we find in terms of replacement tenants obviously, if we can bring tenants and we do bring tenants at our close to the mall average in many cases where they\u2019re doubling or 2.5 times the sales volume, which obviously leads to additional rents.","So where we're seeing the tenants demand is from those that are doing well that want to expand their store, in certain cases they\u2019re new to the centers, in certain cases they\u2019re foreign retailers. But as I mentioned Limited and Wet Seal were generally in our better quality centers, which allows us to replace some with the better quality tenant.","In terms of the occupancy, how much is they baked in there is really two pieces; one is the residual piece from 2016, which carries over into 2017 as well as some estimates for 2017 bankruptcies both those that are known and those that we\u2019re concerned about.","Todd Thomas","And how much of the \u201816 occupancy losses is being carried over?","Robert Perlmutter","I would say it\u2019s probably, evenly split if I had to make an estimate.","Tom O'Hern","That\u2019s right. Most of the \u201816 is front end weighted into \u201817 and the estimates for \u201817 are other than what\u2019s known already such as the Limited and Wet Seal is more towards the back half of the year.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Art Coppola","Hey, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, Art, good morning out there. Two questions, first let me start, well actually let me just ask on the redevelopment, there is a Tysons and Scottsdale were pulled out of the supplemental those have been outlined with timing and with dollar amount. In addition, you guys have the Scottsdale press release of phase one luxury to be then - to followed by Mixed-Use sort of all of Tysons, all of Broadway Plaza. So can you just give us an update of these two projects and if it's a change in the retail environment maybe a change in financing environment or what caused the project to be pulled out?","Tom O'Hern","That's completely driven me Alexander. And when we first put those in we knew that we still had to get certain entitlements especially related to Scottsdale sales. And when I was looking at the expected delivery date it\u2019s just was clear to me that look, 2018 to 2019 is just not realistic on these two it would have to be in the ground for 2018 to be realistic. And given that we're still bidding and ramping up in the next couple of months our approvals with Scottsdale we need to get those approvals, which I'm highly optimistic that we will get them.","And then when they - both of them will undoubtedly be coming back into the pipeline, but instead of having to be determined or some uncertainty around the delivery date we will have a much harder delivery date, as well as a refined scope on each of the projects and refined ROIs on each of the project.","So they'll both come back, but the passage of time had caused the information to get stale. And instead of trying to footnote changes to each of them I just personally decided that I was going to pulled them out until they're ready to get baked into black and white so that we can give you hard delivery date the next or.","Alexander Goldfarb","So Art on the luxury part of phase I at Scottsdale is that also on hold.","Art Coppola","No I'm sorry, I was only talking about the mixed used portion.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes I mean Alex this is Bob Perlmutter. We feel very strongly there is three very important opportunities at Scottsdale, which as you know is one of our largest and most important centers. The first is the opportunity to expand and elevate the luxury, which we begun that process. And we think we have a very strong luxury base, but we think we have the opportunity to really extend it and present it at a much more contemporary manner than we\u2019ve done it today.","Secondly we have a great opportunity to expand the entertainment and restaurant piece. We added a Harkins Theater it's very successful, Phoenix is an excellent restaurant market, we need to improve our presentation at the center and that's a wonderful time with the luxury.","And then the last piece which we are committed to is the mix use, which is principally office and residential. And this is a site that can justify densification. And in fact the Phoenix office market has while we don't have a big presence we do have multiple buildings there that have actually shown some fairly significant rental rate growth over the last couple of years and have been a good contributor to the shopping centers.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Bob and if I continue with you, as you guys look and other mall owners have talked about I mean you guys have said some of your malls and other power center type tenants. Can you just walk us through obviously the mall guys offered much more substantial TIs than the power centers tenants would typically get from tower center or shopping center landlords. But at the same time their occupancy cost is higher their rents higher et cetera.","So when you talk to shopping center power center tenants do they view a one-to-one increase to their sales are going to go up one-for-one for their cost of occupancy or they're prepared for higher occupancy cost and maybe and not have as big of a sales cost. Just trying to understand how they think about the economics when they're deciding if they want to relocate to a mall or not?","Robert Perlmutter","And it's an interesting question, because as you know many of these tenants have located in the shadow of the mall. So they recognize the regional draw that the mall provides. But historically much of their store expansion was outside the mall, but near the mall. I think with the opening of some of these department stores what we're finding is that we now have the real estate to bring these tenants in. And clearly it's a higher occupancy cost than outside the mall, but it's also more traffic and more sales generation.","So DX as you mentioned is I think is a really good example where three or four years ago the majority of their program was probably being done outside of the mall. And today that's probably the inverse, because they see the attributes of the mall like many retailers, which is the scale of the center, the foot traffic that's generated and most importantly the regional draw that the mall creates.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thanks Bobby.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Hi. Couple of questions, first Tom I was wondering can you comment on the straight line in the FAS 141 guidance for 2017 and as we look forward to 2018, do you think we have any material frequency gain versus this year?","Tom O'Hern","Mike, it would really depend on what kind of portfolio moves we make department stores included a big chunk of the reduction in SFAS 141 revenue between what we incurred in \u201816 and what we are forecasting for \u201817 related to the Sears and Kings Plaza and again we don\u2019t intend to focus as much on the non-cash items and in fact we exclude them from our view of same center growth they do have an impact.","So, it\u2019s a little hard to predict that one it depends on how many more big box deals we proactively do this year that could create some differences in this SFAS 141 and straight-line rents. But for now I guess for modeling purposes I would use what we forecast here and we\u2019ll try to address there is changes as we have transactions during the year.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. And then just thinking about new development, can you comment on the Carson [ph] City outside what\u2019s just the view on the side what the processes on your end there?","Art Coppola","We still have aspirations to do something there and when we have something more to report, we\u2019ll report on it.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo Securities.","Art Coppola","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Donnelly","Hey guys. Actually one for Tom, are you able to maybe walk us through some of the key drivers that bridges from your 2016 NOI to your 2017 NOI. I\u2019m just specifically thinking about maybe change in year-end documents fee and like leasing spreads or contractual bumps you see and maybe some assumptions around what you are doing for the Sears stores?","Tom O'Hern","Well, a lot of that Jeff is in the same center assumption, which we got it to in the third quarter call of three to four obviously that's less than we run at in both \u201815 and \u201816 when we were in 5s and 6s is in terms of same center NOI growth. And that encompasses the decrease in occupancy, which we see that exist today what we are seeing through the balance of the year.","So that is factored in obviously positives there of fixed rents bumps as well as CPI bumps and getting the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and deals that were done in 2016 that flow through. But some of the negative that I mentioned a little early they are fairly significant that people may not have focused on we did a lot of financing in many cases we went from floating rate debt to fix rate debt, which can be - even though we are getting some very attractive long-term rates that can still be a 100 to 150 basis points negative compared to the floaters.","And even after the sale of Northgate and Cascade using those proceeds to pay down floating rate debt we still have above $1 billion $1.1 billion of floaters and in our opinion LIBOR is going to continue to go up this year. And we\u2019ve factored that into the guidance and in fact all those refinancing as well as higher LIBOR ends up being about $0.07 to $0.08 negative deferential compared to what we saw in 2016.","We also expect not to see the same kind of gain on land sale that we saw in 2016, which was about $4 million and those are the major pieces obviously Kings Plaza, which we talked about it\u2019s a relatively unique event where we have a department store that's paying you that much rent obviously we think it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to improve the quality of Kings Plaza, but when you combine the loss rent and charges, as well as the write-off of SFAS 141 it\u2019s $0.11 negative in 2017 compared to 2016. So those are the big pieces.","Jeff Donnelly","That's helpful. And maybe if I can sneak in with a second question, sort of a two part, one just Art since you had mentioned that about traffic trends are you guys able to provide maybe some data on just in 2016 how traffic varied from your sort of highest tier assets to your lowest tier assets? I\u2019m just curious how that correlates with sales growth?","And then secondarily maybe this is for Bob, just retailers are getting more discriminating around their store counts we\u2019re hearing that landlords with multiple malls and given metro are effectively having a kind of pick a winner and a looser in those markets by refocusing tenants on one property versus the other and focusing capital the same way. I\u2019m just curious how do you guys managed that dynamic in your markets because they are so costlier in some cases sort of in like a Phoenix just curious how you handle that?","Art Coppola","Sure, well on the traffic issue we don\u2019t have absolute traffic counters at our malls right now across the board we have different measuring points. Sometimes where we have controlled parking, that's a good proxy or measuring point, and we do have traffic counters in different ways at different malls that we are primarily using frankly more to not measure whether people are coming but how are they moving inside of the property to help us in the leasing process.","So as we think about traffic I guess the global statement I would give is that it's a fact that people are doing more research before they come and shop. So and they're spending more per visit which would tend to make you believe that on average that visits should go down. But anecdotally and where we actually have evidence we're not seeing traffic decreases.","I mean we have some centers at Santa Monica place where the traffic is up ridiculous amount, I think it's up 40% in the last six months. But we know why I mean it was because some mass transit has come recently. We have centers like Cerritos where Bobby what do we think that the traffic is up at that center?","It's doubled it's close to 20% at least, and it's generating itself and that's primarily I think driven by the theaters and decks that we added there. So I can tell you that I'm certain that our traffic is not down significantly, if anything it's probably flat. And as I think about it from a high productivity to a low productivity, I don't have any anecdotal evidence for you on that. I would just intuitively say that you would assume that at the high traffic centers traffic is going to tend to remain strong if not get better and if centers that are in a decline you would assume that the traffic is diminishing.","But to me the real issue is why is traffic going down if it were going down. And the answer is that we don't think traffic is going down. And secondly it's not reflected in sales, I already gave you the numbers that on a comp center basis our sales per foot over the past seven years has gone up 37% in our total sales in those same comp centers has gone up almost 40%.","So honestly when I think about traffic, our sales numbers which we reports to you center-by-center you can go back and look at our supplements and you can look at every property that we own for the last seven years, and you're going to see an upward trend.","So for all of these people that are not owners that are out there either claiming that traffic is down or retailers who are blaming traffic for the fact that they don't have the merchandise in their store that people want to buy just wrong. And that doesn't mean that we don't think about traffic in a very intelligent way. And we're really beginning to refine the way that we think about traffic, we're putting in camera monitors and sensors that measure gender, customer engagement as how people move throughout the mall, which stores do they cross shop all with the view not to report to Wall Street on this, but to enhance our leasing tools to bring in even better tenants and to have at least smarter about how we locate a center.","Robert Perlmutter","So Jeff you're going to test my memory with what the second part of your question, but I think you were asking about as retailers rationalize their store fleet in markets what the impact and how do we try to manage it?","Jeff Donnelly","Yes particularly in the market where you have multiple malls.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes so the - and Phoenix is a really good example of that. And candidly we try to use it to our benefit in terms of being able to not be in competitive situations with other malls, but control the discussions with the retail and say here is how we want you or here is the best way to cover the market. And we\u2019re much more effective obviously when we can control the dominant locations when the dominant locations are split between multiple owners and the owners compete.","We have a similar circumstance in Southern California with Lake Wood and Stone Wood in Los Cerritos where those three centers basically are the only opportunity for retailers in that portion of the LA market, and we try to coordinate the discussions whether it\u2019s certain retailers belonging in certain centers, whether it\u2019s in the case of Phoenix trying to help retailers with store rationalization that includes, closing stores that are outside the mall because one of the things that will result from fewer stores in each market is the regional draw will become more important just by definition and we believe that lead them to the enclosed malls as oppose to the non-mall locations.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll now go to Paul Morgan with Canaccord.","Art Coppola","Hey, Paul.","Paul Morgan","Hi, thanks. Appreciate the color on Wet Seal and the spreads there and I mean looks like I got the math right, but they look like their occupancy cost was 25% or something like that and we brought in people had a positive spread and assuming closer to your portfolio average at a much lower occupancy cost.","But I\u2019m kind of wondering lot of apparel retailers have had a tough past year how deep is that pool of change where there really unsustainable occupancy cost and kind of how does that balance against sort of where you\u2019re seeing demand from the people who can generate sales that are at or above your average?","Robert Perlmutter","Well, let me - I think your math is correct. The occupancy costs were 27% or 28%. But again both of these changes were changes that had struggled for a number of years. So it\u2019s not that there was a change in the nature of the business that caused the bankruptcy, it was really an erosion over a period of years, and what we find is in particular if you\u2019re focusing on apparel, the market has matured and it\u2019s moved away from smaller specialty stores that primarily trade-on on foot traffic into large formatted retailer.","So people talk about the apparel sector shrinking within the malls and that\u2019s probably true, if you look at smaller size stores, but when you look at the aggregate numbers it include people like Zara and H&M, you find it\u2019s partly a transfer of the customer\u2019s preference. And so a chain like Limited or a chain Wet Seal, it\u2019s been in decline for a number of years, they really struggled with competition and it wasn\u2019t a single event that caused it.","Obviously the replacement tenants are on the other side of the business model, their business is strong, they want to grow their store fleet and one of the reasons we've been able to generate a good amount of activity right away is these stores were located in good centers, in good locations which retailers do have opens to buy-end.","Paul Morgan","Okay, thanks. And then just kind of similar, but on the department store side, first is does the $0.11 that I understood from the Sears at Kings with is that the full amount that you recognized in \u201816 that will be zero in \u201817, is that the way to think about it?","Tom O'Hern","That\u2019s correct Paul, including non-cash items.","Paul Morgan","Yes, okay. And obviously that I mean, it look like that made of one box was sort of a third of this year\u2019s rent to you, just looking at your top tenant list, so it\u2019s not a typical situation there, but with all the focus on kind of accelerating anchor closings and maybe particularly at Sears over the coming year or two, I mean how should we kind of think about exposure there in terms of materiality because having an impact on year-over-year growth, the timing and how quick - how - what you think you can absorb on an annual basis in terms of box closings, how deep is your demand pool for that?","Art Coppola","I\u2019ll answer that. First of all I want to remind you all that we voluntarily allowed Sears to close at Kings Plaza and to pay us a termination payment had we not allow that to happen they would still be sitting there operating and paying rent. We did that knowing that it was going to be very expensive from an earnings viewpoint, because it gave us the opportunity to take basically 300,000 feet in a terrific mall, where we've make huge headways and to completely reinvent it. And we have a really exciting merchandising plan that is in play at Kings Plaza.","We've already announced that Primark is coming in and going to build the flagship store there and we think they are really perfect for the market. And we have five or six other major users that we are in various stages of conversations with to take up pieces of the remaining space that was previously occupied by Sears. And I'm absolutely confident that when we announce the final line of merchants that's going to replace there, and more importantly when we actually get them open for business you\u2019re going to look back on that and say wow what a transformation, what a success that was.","Moving away from King's Plaza as I've indicated in the recent closings from the Macy's and Sears and we had one that we anticipated and that's what we got. When I look at the portfolio that we have both from the ones that you might suspect might be closing stores or even if you just take a look at the overall picture.","We are in a very good position to take and have the ability to recycle anchor boxes in our portfolio. Our portfolio as well as the entire U.S. mall industry is both concentrated in square footage that is dedicated to the department stores compared to what's needed and compared to what the global standards and benchmarks are.","The whole reason to bring these department stores into these centers 50 years ago was to create traffic and that was the traffic that they would bring that gave us the ability to lease the small shop space. So as these department stores rationalize their store fleet, which I would maintain that if they do it in a smart way that they could do what we\u2019ve done, which is basically to prove our portfolio and redeploy that money into their core portfolio and end up with a stronger business.","But as I think about it, it is definitely for us an opportunity going forward. And I think we're in a terrific position to capitalize on that opportunity. And I do think that as certain anchors go away we will bring in non-traditional types of traffic generators. So whether it would be restaurants or theaters or sporting goods operators, grocery stores, entertainment complexes. Things that generate traffic that take advantage of the regional and in many cases the super-regional location.","Again one of my peers has been very good about bringing home the point that if you ask a whole bunch of retailers in the world that traditionally don't go to malls. If they want to come to a mall the answer is they're going to come back and say no I don't want to go to a mall I don't go to malls.","And then if you ask them a different questions say look, do you want to do business in this particular city, and he say okay, yes. If you want to do business in this particular city would you like to be located in the single best location from a viewpoint of Ontario car traffic transportation infrastructure and co-tenancy in the entire market, and the answer would always be yes.","And so look that is the challenge if you will at bringing in some of these non-traditional retailers into the malls. But it\u2019s something that clearly our peers and we are going to be focused on. And again let\u2019s just simply bring this more in line with global merchandising models.","Paul Morgan","Okay thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Art Coppola","Hey, Steve.","Steve Sakwa","Hi, how are you? Couple of questions, maybe start off with Bob. The 5.3 years that you mentioned is the average lease term. I guess I would have maybe thought it's a bit longer. Has that number sort of been trending lower has that number changed meaningful over the last say year or two? And secondly, what percentage of your overall annual leasing would be captured in your re-leasing spreads?","Robert Perlmutter","So to answer the first question the fourth quarter average lease term was lower. The previous quarter I believe it was seven years. And as I mentioned in my comments, we had a fairly significant group of package renewals and many of those leases were shorter in nature either at our request or the tenant\u2019s desire. But it was really impacted by some of these package renewals. So I don't think we're seen anything trend changes as much as just a package in the quarter that was different than the historical package.","And then secondly we captured pretty much everything in our spreads under 10,000 square feet. So that's my gut is somewhere between - it's probably about in terms of total aggregate volume 35% plus or minus. The rest would be stores over 10,000 square feet.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess Tom I just want to make sure I understand the disclosure you've got on Page 30 in the development pipeline, when you talk about things in the 4% yield on that project. So basically you are saying you lost $10 million in rents you're going to spend $100 million to redevelop that and you're basically going to get back effectively $15 million so kind of the four incremental over the 11. Is the way to think about that?","Tom O'Hern","Steve the $10 million was rent and charges. So about half of that was property taxes, CAM charges things like that. So it's not the full tenants it's more like 5 or 6 is the part that actually hits NOI.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. But I guess I'm just trying to think through the overall return. I mean it sounds you gave up rent to $5 million to $6 million you're now spending 100. Is that $5 million to $6 million may then go to $10 million. I guess I'm just trying to think how you assess these boxes taking them box and what kind of is appropriate return to get on that incremental capital?","Art Coppola","I'll answer what's an appropriate return. Look if we - and I know that I maybe in minority here. But I will say that if let's assume that and I'll pick a round number of 4 to 5 type of cap rate 20 to 25 type of multiple is the way investors view the value of our malls. If we can remerchandise a department store location across the board, and now I'm not talking about one location I'm talking about many locations.","And we can generate returns that are in that mid-single digit category. And in depth with retailers that are more complementary and generate more traffic for the benefit of everybody which creates higher productivity, higher rents and higher EBITDA I'm going to do it every day of the week.","So I'm not the guy that's going to sit here and tell you that remerchandising department store boxes is going to generate the same types of returns that one can generate on ground up development opportunities around massive new expansion opportunities. From our money I'm very happy to receive a mid-digit return on new capital if I see dramatically improve the quality of the anchor coming with the new idea that something that generates a lot more business and prolongs the sustainability and the energy of the center in question. I know that maybe in a minority on that, but that's the way I feel as to what is an acceptable return. Is it appropriate I don't know, is it acceptable absolutely all day along.","Steve Sakwa","Okay thanks. If I could just maybe ask more follow-up to Bob, just in terms of all the space that maybe you're taking back from some of these bankrupt tenants. And you think about the different categories that you could re-lease to. I'm just curious how much of it is sort of apparel driven and how much would be sort of food, entertainment other uses that are either new to the mall or just kind of expanding the mall offering?","Robert Perlmutter","I'm not sure that I could give you a good answer in terms of changes in categories. I mean we have seen our food grow over the last 10 years, I think it's about 10%. We have seen the apparel stores migrate to larger boxes from smaller boxes. We have seen certain categories like health and beauty, athletic, footwear many specialty retailers expand.","So I'm not sure that I have a really good formula to tell you what's changing. I will tell you there is retailers in all the categories who are expanding and there is retailers in all the categories who are stable and there is retailers in all the categories that are contracting.","Art Coppola","So I would just to that Steve you have I believe a research partner that has provided some previous commentary on this. Look the traditional department store over the years was let\u2019s say radical 95% apparel, one way or other softer.","As those people shrink the apparel that used to be sold within the four walls of that box is definitely going to go down dramatically and we are definitely going to replace what was predominantly an apparel reseller and I want to use that in the same context that a retail analyst would use it, with uses that are not apparel but generate a lot more traffic and generate higher returns for us. It\u2019s just the evolution of the business model and it\u2019s a good evolution, so definitely lots of apparel.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks guys.","Art Coppola","Thank you. All right well listen thank you very much for joining us on the call and we look forward to seeing you all in the near future and thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone for joining us today on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing; and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom OHern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with past practice, we\u2019ll be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me, or John Perry or Jean Wood.","It was another very strong quarter. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results of all the major portfolio transformations that we\u2019ve been through the past two years including the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of the capital in a more productive faster-growing assets.","Leasing spreads were good again this quarter. We signed 321,000 square feet of leases, positive re-leasing spread of 21% over the trailing 12 months, mall occupancy at a high level at 95.4% which was up 30 basis points, compared to March 31 of last year.","And looking at the temporary occupancy, we continue to reduce that that was 5.2% compared to 5.5% at March 31 of last year. We\u2019ll continue to focus on that area which we continue to see the potential to grow NOI as a result of converting that temporary occupancy to permanent occupancy. Average mall base rents increased to 54.19% that was up 10% from a year ago.","FFO for the quarter was $0.79 compared to $0.81 for the prior year, reflected in there was $2.2 million of gain on early extinguishment of debt on Lakewood going the other direction, was $13.6 million of expenses related to an unsolicited takeover attempt. Excluding the gain on extinguishment, as well as the expenses, FFO came in at $0.86 share for the quarter ahead of both our guidance and the consensus estimates.","Impacting the quarter with same center NOI growth had a sector leading 5%, compared to last year. This increase was driven by increased occupancy policy releasing spreads, annual rate increases and aggressive operating cost management.","The gross margin improved to 66.6% that was up from 64.9% a year ago and also driven by occupancy gains, the strongly leasing environment, including second half of last year, rent bumps, as well as expense reductions in the first quarter of this year. Bad debt expense was up slightly $4.6 million, compared to $800,000 last year in the first quarter, much of that was driven by RadioShack and Wet Seal.","The average interest rate continue to go down was 3.5% at quarter-end, compared to 4.1% at March 31 of 2014. The balance sheet is in great shape, we have the strongest balance sheet that we\u2019ve had in the history of our company. At quarter end the various balance sheet metrics for debt-to-market cap 33%, interest coverage ratio at 3.5 times, debt to EBITDA on a forward basis 7.2 times, average debt maturity 5.4 years, floating rate debt that as a percentage of total debt was 19%, that is somewhat artificially high, as we paid off Lakewood during the quarter. We will be refinancing that with a permanent loan, we\u2019ve agreed to $410 million loan, 11 years, $343 million. Fixed rate and that\u2019s going to be funded this quarter in the proceeds of used to pay down the line of credit. In addition we are in the market to put a lot of long-term fixed rate loan on the unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. Those proceeds will be in the neighborhood of $320 million to $340 million and those proceeds will also be used primarily to pay down our line of credit.","In a press release this morning, based on the strong first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we\u2019ve marked our FFO guidance range up to $3.83 to $3.93, also embedded in that increase was an increase in our assumption of same-center NOI growth which we bunked 25 basis points to a range 4.5% to 5% on average for the year.","We did that tenant sales growth during the quarter, the average portfolio sales per foot for the trailing 12 months was $607.00 that compared to $565.00, a year ago. If you look at it on a same center basis, excluding dispositions that happened over the course of last 12 months, the same-center sales were $604 and that compared to $579 on the same-center basis for an increase of 4.3%. Strongest regions for us were again California and Arizona, which were both of strong.","This point I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss only single environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks Tom. The first quarter lease activity was solid generating above average leasing spreads on good velocity. We continue to see retailers invest our capital into the following venues: a) mall locations, outlet centers, flagship locations and omnichannel retail initiatives. The quality of the Macerich portfolio was consistent with the retailer objectives, which is demonstrated in above-average operating metrics. Areas of strength within the portfolio included: one, large format retailers and anchor retailers. During Q1 over 400,000 square feet of new leases were executed with retailers over 10,000 square feet. Some of the notable deals completed during the first quarter included Century 21 and Green Acres Mall and Restoration Hardware Gallery, who will construct 50,000 square foot building at The Village at Corte Madera, which is the Company\u2019s hometown.","Secondly, we are seeing the expansion of core brands from retailers with larger store fleets, throughout the portfolio retailer such as L Brands, Foot Locker, luxottica, Kay Jewelers, support our expanding their square footages and developing new format. Within our portfolio, these core tenants represented significant amount of the square footage and the strength of their business benefits our centers.","Thirdly, there is continued growth from foreign based retailers. Demand for space within the center is high as the U.S. markets are viewed favorably with good growth prospects in the coming years. Most of the attention falls on the fast fashion retailers, which include H&M or UNIQLO.","Within our portfolio, we have been active with all three, including two new deals signed during Q1 with Zara [ph], as Broadway Plaza and the Oaks. While much of the attention is rightly focused on these three players, we also see activity from foreign-based retailers including Adidas, Kooples, Garage, Lululemon, Espresso, KIKO, Gerry Weber, Joe Malone, Michael Hill and importantly [indiscernible].","Next while more limited in their store openings, we see demand from emerging specialty brands on either a standalone basis or within the umbrella of larger retail companies. Examples of larger retail companies developing new brands, which generate store expansions, include Lululemon, development with Aviva; Gap's expansion of Athleta; Ann Taylor's development of Lou & Grey; H&M's development of & Other Stories; and Macy's purchase of Bluemercury.","New standalone concepts that we have completed deals with include Kitinase who have signed on to the Broadway Plaza expansion, Soft Surroundings, who signed three leases during the quarter; Yellow box the recently opened at Kierland Commons; Jonathan Adler, who recently opened at Santa Monica Place; and Kendall Scott, who have come into La Encantada.","Finally, we continue to experience growth in the fast casual and full service restaurant categories. During the first quarter, we signed leases with [indiscernible] passions going Queens Center bringing our portfolio total to four units. We also signed deals with Cheesecake Factory at the Los Cerritos in Santa Monica both properties are adding state-of-the-art theaters. We also continue to expand our presence with more traditional players like Chipotle, Starbucks and Teavana.","Regarding 2014 bankruptcies, we\u2019ve made great progress with re-leasing of Coldwater Creek, Juicy and Love Culture. Within our portfolio, there were a combined 27 locations containing approximately 170,000 square feet. To date, deals have been completed on approximately 80% of the spaces. While impacting our occupancy in the short term we have significantly improved the quality of the tenancy and the productivity from these spaces. New tenants signed for these locations are illustrative of who is active in the marketplace. Deals completed include Anthropologie, Hanna Andersson, Vera Bradley, Pandora, Michael Kors, Soft Surroundings, Aviva, St. John's, Uniqlo, Kiehl's and H&M.","Bankruptcies during the first quarter included Wet Seal, RadioShack, Cache, Deb Shops and Body Shop. In total, these store closures included 52 locations with approximately 113,000 square feet. This impacted the portfolio occupancy by about 50 basis points in Q1. Looking forward we believe there are opportunities to increase revenues by one, increasing our total occupancy while continuing to reduce temporary tenant occupancy levels. Two, significantly increasing the revenue generation and presentation quality within the common areas. And three, maximizing our leasing spreads based on the continued improvement of the portfolio quality.","In summary, we believe our portfolio is well-positioned in the current retail environment with many must-have locations for retailers in both traditional mall and outlet center format.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Bobby and Tom. As you can tell, we have a terrific quarter and our outlook for the future, the balance of this year on the operating front is extremely strong. While the focus today on our call is on the business and operating and financial results, I would like to make a few brief comments with respect to recent developments. We would then like to keep the remainder of the call focused on our strong earnings performance and guidance. We would appreciate it if you could please keep your questions during the Q&A session focused on our results and outlook.","First, I want to highlight that we always seek to maintain open communication with our shareholders and we value their viewpoints. Over the past two months together with our lead director, Fred Hubbell, we have spent a significant amount of time speaking and listening to the majority of our top 30 shareholders. One of the consistent comments from these meetings is that our shareholders want us to remain focused on the business to ensure that we continue driving outsized returns. This is our top priority and I can tell you that our entire organization is engaged and energized with a singular focus on performance and shareholder returns.","You will see that as Tom and I continue to share with you the results during the balance of this call and discuss with you a number of our new and recent initiatives. In addition, our shareholders have also expressed their viewpoints on governance including the difficult decisions that we made in light of the takeover attempt. The board did not take these or make these decisions lightly. The board only implemented governance changes because it believed they were essential to protecting shareholder value. We continue to solicit shareholder feedback on this topic and intend to announce several changes in the near future that we believe will further demonstrate the board\u2019s ongoing commitment to sound corporate governance. Again, these will be announced in the near future, we are not prepared to get into the details on them today.","I also want to briefly address the nominations that we have received and related litigation. As the litigation is pending we will not be commenting further on it today. In summary and as noted in our preliminary proxy, we notify the New York Stock Exchange that the record date for 2015 annual meeting would March 20 of 2015. Land and buildings was not a shareholder on March 22. It acquired 1,100 shares after the record date on March 25 and March 26 and submitted its nominations on March 31. We advised them privately that because they were not a stockholder of record on March 20, but their submission was defective. The rules to nominate candidates are the same for all stockholders and this matter is now pending before the court.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to picking up on the results of our quarter and our prognosis for the balance of the year. As you can see from the number that Tom shared with you that you have read and the color that Bobby just gave to you, we had a terrific quarter and we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth and value creation at Macerich over the balance of this year and into the future. We believe that the company has had an important inflection point with outsized growth coming over the next several years, as that we reap the benefits of the significant investments we have made in portfolio management and the transformation of our portfolio. A particular note, it is nice to see that our average sales per foot today, on our entire portfolio is an excess on $600 a square foot.","We believe that our focus on the following five major initiatives will play an important role and our ability to continue to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. Five initiatives are to continue to drive same-center NOI growth at above average rates, to improve our operating margins and have margin expansion. Portfolio management is number three. I'm going to be talking about number four, the Sears joint venture that was just announced this morning Sear, and number five, our ongoing developments.","In terms of same center NOI growth due to the pruning of our portfolio and the reinvestment of that capital into our highly productive core portfolio, we see the opportunity for superior same-center NOI growth, both this year and of the years to come. Our targeted same-center NOI growth is now for this year, budgeted and guided to be 4.5% to 5% represents a significant acceleration for past years.","Number two, another major initiative that frankly is the result of a wake up call on this topic is operating margin expansion. In addition to the same-center NOI growth that we anticipate, we also see the opportunity to increase our operating margins, both this year and next. We believe that in the very foreseeable future which I'm looking out over 24 months that we have the opportunity to increase our operating margins by at least 400 basis points. Primarily this will be down through a combination of efficiency project, as well as enhancing the common areas of our malls, to improve the customer experience and increase our incremental revenues from that area.","Three, portfolio management and capital recycling, we are currently taking in-balance and sending out balance through examine opportunities to monetize assets within our portfolio, both through joint ventures, as well as through dispositions and to re-deploy those proceeds into the most profitable vehicle available to us at that point in time. We think that through asset monetization and portfolio management, that that will help many of you to help through get better transparency and improve your view of the NAV of the company. We believe that it will validate the view of the NAV of the company that management has and that our Board concluded.","Number four, the Sears joint venture, this was just concluded late last night. In that transaction, we entered into a transaction very similar to the ones that Sears entered into with two of our other peers. We are entering into a joint venture for the redevelopment of nine Sears locations that are presently owned and controlled by Sears. This is a fifty-fifty joint venture and gives us the right to recapture 50% of the GLA that Sears occupies and to redeploy that.","We are investing $150 million into this joint venture and anticipate just north of a 6% return on our investment in the beginning year with opportunities to profitably reinvest into this joint ventures we identify recycling and redevelopment opportunities at these nine locations. I would point out with the nine locations that we entered into a joint venture with Sears at average sales per square foot at the mall itself $680 a square foot. The locations are Arrowhead and Chandler in Phoenix; Stan Bury in Connecticut, Deptford, New Jersey, Freehold, New Jersey; Los Cerritos in Southern California; South Plains in Lubbock; Vintage Fair Modesto and Washington Square in the Greater Portland markets.","In addition, concurrently with that transaction we are also entered into an agreement with Seers that gives us the right to recapture 300,000 square foot store at Kings Plaza with 180 days prior notice. That really will jump start the next phase of the Kings Plaza redevelopment, we are just finishing up remodeling and remerchandising the mall. And we are in talks today for the addition of two to three new anchors and our junior anchors to redeploy that Seers square footage. We see great opportunities there.","Moving into the development area, I'm not going to go through each of our development pipeline activities, because I want to leave plenty of time for questions. I will just comment upon one in particular and that is Tysons Corner. It is now coming to completion in terms of the densification project. Our board had a meeting at Tysons Corner last week and I would encourage you all to get an opportunity the next time you are in the marketplace to take a look at what we have accomplished there.","Our office complex is now over 85% leased, the hotel is open. The residential tower is having, the tenants being to move in this weekend. The tower is already 25% pre-leased which is significantly above what our residential fee developer had projected, at rents that are above our pro forma and are the top of the market in the marketplace.","So in summary, we are extremely bullish on our prospects. We think that we have a very clear plan to continue to deliver shareholder value and we look forward to discussing that plan and delivering on that plan over the months to come.","Again, as a reminder, our call today is to discuss our results for the quarter recently ended. We are happy to address any questions about financial and operating results, redevelopment initiatives, pipeline and outlook, but we will not be commenting further on the other matters that I discussed earlier about governments and other litigation.","Thank you in advantage for your cooperation, and operator we would like to now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first with Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Art Coppola","Good morning Mike.","Mike Mueller","Yes hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin expansion opportunities you mentioned, CAM efficiencies and just being able to generate more revenues there?","Art Coppola","Yes, so again like I mentioned we have to wake up call obviously in November when this topic was first broad to the conversation in conjunction with the unsolicited takeover attemp. And we did a big soul-searching and said either ways that we can improve our margins. We have some systemic issues with some of our margins, where we do business in major urban marketplaces, we are at the cross of doing business is extremely high primarily from real estate taxes and infrastructure costs. And those margins will always be different than a suburban location. But the revenues in the sales make up forced to the bottom line is the profitability of the mall and the urban malls generate a huge NOI\u2019s, even though the margins on balance may not look as attractive as a suburban mall.","But having said that, we did some of the conclusion, that we could in fact through a combination of initiatives they are dozens, and dozens and dozens of initiatives that add up to getting to the ability to increase our margins by 400 basis points. Some of them are cost saving initiatives some of them are revenue generating initiatives in a multitude of different areas. But I think that clearly there is an opportunity, which we have been working on anyway through the middle of last year and into the end of last year into elevating the common area experience of in our malls, which includes many different initiatives to improve the customer experience, things like eliminating customer service booths and going to either a virtual concierge or roving concierge and then replacing service booths with revenue generating retailers. And through a combination of really expense reductions and common area revenue enhancements, we clearly see that over the next 24 months there is about 400 basis point of operating margin expansion available to us. I would say that about a 100 basis points of that is pretty well baked into our guidance for this year, but there is still lots of upside to be derived in that arena.","Art Coppola","Okay, thank you.","Jean Wood","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Art Coppola","Good morning Jeff.","Craig Schmidt","Hi, actually it is Craig Schmidt, I am here on behalf of Jeff.","Art Coppola","Hey, Craig.","Craig Schmidt","Art, can you share with us some of the results of the valuation work done by East Hill and how they viewed your ability to create via [ph] value going forward?","Art Coppola","What\u2019s the second part of your question\u2026","Craig Schmidt","Just maybe what they did in that work that might impact how you see creating value going forward?","Art Coppola","Well, they didn't have to do anything other than take a look at the portfolio as a static portfolio simply looking at the income the way that any buyer would look at the income which is on a forward 12-month period of time. They didn't have to project that into the future, any of the development activity that will be generating huge value. And simply based upon that work, they were able to share results with the Board and opinions that indicated the offer that have been put on the table was simply not adequate.","Craig Schmidt","And just on the Sears JV, how did you select the nine centers to go in? It seemed like you have a greater proportion of high productivity malls in your store count.","Art Coppola","Well, we have been communicating with Sears on this matter since December 10. Actually we first approached Sears with the idea of doing a joint venture on their real estate as opposed to them trying to monetize it or build up a development department themselves back in a personal meeting I had with Eddie Lambert on December 10. I guess you could say unfortunately I got little distracted over the coming months, from being able to finish our joint venture but I guess, we kind of planted the seed with Eddie and others helped to cultivate the tree and now we are kind of picking the apples off the tree.","So we identified the nine locations that we thought had the most upside in terms of what we could really demonstrate to each other in terms of value. We agreed on those nine locations and then collateral to that conversation, we talked about several leased locations and one in particular that we had an immediate need for and appetite for that they were willing to cooperate with us with us on, was Kings Plaza.","So you are right, if you look at the way Greenstreet has their database, all of the nine locations that we did joint ventures on were A+ to A- type of malls but more importantly since we disclose sales per square foot by property versus others, you can see and know that our nine locations do $680 a square foot which if you compare that to the database that Greenstreet has on the other transactions, is a significant notch above in quality.","So again I mean look, we are very happy to do this with Sears. We think it is a very positive step in terms of helping them rationalize and we think there's a lot of upside for the Company and it is immediately accretive to this year's earnings.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thanks Craig.","Operator","And we will go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Sullivan","Yes, good morning. A question, a further question on the operating margin commentary, you had said, Art, that about 100 basis points of the 400 basis points is already baked into the 2015 guidance. Just to make sure we understand this, this 4% increase in operating margins by our calculation is something that could work out to be as high as $0.40 a share when fully achieved. And going back to the November presentation and in Tom O\u2019Hern\u2019s part of a presentation, he had talked about same property NOI growth going forward over the next five years in a range of 3%, 3.25% to 5.25%. Am I correct in understanding that the incremental margin or the margin gain here is incremental to that guidance?","Tom OHern","Jim, as Art said, 1% had already been factored into our forecast for 2015 at the time we made that presentation certainly a portion of it is in there, but with this new focus we would have much more of the bias today towards upper half of that range we gave in November than we did then. But yes, 75% of the margin expansion really was not identified at our Investor Day on November 18.","Jim Sullivan","And therefore putting a number on that, that sounds like to me it is about an incremental $0.30 a share?","Art Coppola","I'm not sure, we think about more in dollars, and I think it\u2019s a little bit less than $30.","Tom OHern","Yes, that\u2019s sounds little high to me, Jim.","Art Coppola","We think it will take a bit more of the total in the $35 million to $40 million of Code. And 75% of that is to be reaped over and above what\u2019s in our current guidance for this year.","Jim Sullivan","So that sounds like $0.17 to $0.18? Okay.","Art Coppola","I think you do the math on that per share. Thank you, Jim","Jim Sullivan","Okay.","Operator","And we will go next to Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Good morning.","Ki Bin Kim","Good morning. So part of that 400 basis points of operating margin you are talking about right now, how much of that has to do maybe with contemplating going from CPI-based leases to fixed CAM because I would imagine in a low-inflation environment that might make a big difference?","Art Coppola","None.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And in terms of quality\u2026","Art Coppola","But, and that could drive that I suppose if I would have think about it, but none. That\u2019s not in our thinking there.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. So in terms of the Sears JV, it seems like the current structure that 50% of the space can be taken back and leased out or for better purposes but is that just kind of laid out current structure but eventually if you can make more money on it, it can be higher than 50%?","Art Coppola","Yes. It could be agreed upon by the parties, yes.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, yes. Okay, sounds good. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to George Auerbach with Credit Suisse.","Art Coppola","Good morning, George.","George Auerbach","Good morning, guys. Art, you mentioned continuing to try to pare back the portfolio and look at dispositions. Do you have any assets on the market today and I guess more broadly, what would you expect disposition volume to be over the next call it 12 months?","Art Coppola","So I would encourage you not to think in terms of dispositions even though that could be part of our plan to monetize assets. So I think of it in terms of asset monetization and portfolio management. Dispositions could be a part of that. Dispositions could also be none of that but we do believe and secondly, there are no properties on the market. We are having strategic conversations with the logical buyers of 100% assets so those would be disposition conversations.","But more philosophical and kind of identifying what their appetite is, size, geography things of that nature. We are also talking to a number of very significant core type of investors on the possibility of doing some joint ventures. And this is really on the joint venture side of it, a lot of that is driven by an appetite I think to help all of you that are on this call to update your thinking on NAVs and we do believe that we would have a great use of proceeds for that capital if and when we do it but I think look, there is definitely an appetite for - I think somebody wrote this morning show me the money - to show you the money, to monetize some assets, to demonstrate values.","And so we had a number of inbound indications of interest and we have reached out to a couple of our core investors that we currently do business with and I think there is going to be an opportunity here to really validate our view on the value of our portfolio while creating significant liquidity for the Company, achieving portfolio management, by hopefully also recycling out of some lower growth assets into higher growth. And then the ultimate redeployment of that capital which we anticipate could be quite significant will be determined to be whatever is the smartest use of that capital at the point in time that the monetization has been accomplished. It\u2019s definitely in our play book for this year.","George Auerbach","I guess just on the sources and uses then, do you envision yourself being net acquirers of third-party assets just given that you can't really shield the gains from these sales? I know you have use of proceeds in development but with the gains, do you envision yourselves sort of growing the asset count?","Art Coppola","At this point in time it will be whatever we see is the most profitable re-deployment of the capital at that point in time.","George Auerbach","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, good morning. I guess my question is this. If $95.50 [ph] substantially undervalued the company and you're going to be potentially selling your JV assets, why not use a decent amount of that capital to be recycled into buying back your stock I guess in a balanced way with your capital needs in terms of development, redevelopment.?","Art Coppola","That could be one of the most profitable vehicles to redeploy the proceeds at some point in the future.","Ross Nussbaum","And do you have, remind me, do you have an existing buyback plan in place or is that something that you have got to do?","Art Coppola","We do not have one in place today. No.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. And just as a follow-up, I think your March 31 release also talked about selectively expanding the outlet program. Can you give us a sense of what is in the pipeline over the next couple of years in terms of new outlet development beyond San Francisco?","Art Coppola","Given that, that it\u2019s really selective it\u2019s really just more of an avenue that we intend to continue to pursue. I think the possibility of expanding Fashion Outlets of Chicago is","in our future. We just completed the expansion of Fashion Outlets of Niagara. I think that the Candlestick Fashion Outlets at San Francisco we are already pre-leasing it, that is going to be terrific. We\u2019re well underway in terms of the re-branding of our project with Penn REIT in Philadelphia.","So we have got a lot on our plate and a lot to execute on that are going to be very meaningful. Having said that, we are definitely trying to source opportunities that are of that quality going forward but given that we have such a high bar in terms of what we are seeking to achieve, this could it for now. We\u2019ve always said that we see us having a handful of these assets and but that we want them to be dominant. If we\u2019re able to uncover further opportunities then that would be great.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will go Haendel St Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St Juste","Good morning guys - good morning out there.","Art Coppola","[Indiscernible]","Haendel St Juste","So, Art, can you talk about the tenor of your conversations you are having with tenants and how that might have changed over the past year or so as your portfolio quality has improved? Your leasing spreads remained here in the low 20s for the past couple of years despite selling a number of lower tier malls. So curious on perhaps maybe you can give some color on how that looks for maybe some of your top tier versus maybe some of your mid-tier malls. And then how we should think about that going forward? And I ask because obviously your portfolio quality has improved. You have some of the best dirt and best locations out there but your pricing power doesn't appear to have taken as much hold perhaps as I would have thought or seen and especially as you jettison some of your lower quality assets.","Art Coppola","Well, I'm going to ask about Bob Perlmutter to give you color. I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily say that our pricing power hasn\u2019t been revealed because I think that our releasing spreads have been up the top in our sector, they are certainly up there. But look, our leasing conversations are back and forth and we seek to make deals with tenants that we think are the right merchants for our malls. Sometimes we don\u2019t go for just the highest rent, sometimes we go for the right merchant and so I\u2019m going to ask Bob to talk though and give you more color on what we see here.","Robert Perlmutter","I think what we have seen from a spread, you are right, the percentage increase has been relatively consistent and at the higher end of the range but obviously we are finding some much higher rents and much higher average rents was in the center as the portfolio improves. We see pricing power improving because we are out of a situation of reverse leverage where the tenants know that they have an equal seat at the table with the desire to keep stores open at lesser quality centers. So we feel like we have been able to accomplish a similar percentage increase on a higher rental rate which is an indication that the strategy of pruning the portfolio is the right one.","Haendel St Juste","Can you give any incremental color on how perhaps those spreads differ between some of your higher productivity and more mid-productivity mall?","Bob Perlmutter","Clearly be higher productivity malls as a general rule are generating higher levels of spreads but the spreads are positive generally throughout the entire portfolio.","Haendel St Juste","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Christy McElroy with Citi.","Art Coppola","Good morning.","Christy McElroy","Good morning, everyone.","Tom OHern","Good morning.","Christy McElroy","Good morning.","John Perry","Morning.","Christy McElroy","Just following up on your comments just further on monetized assets, you mentioned that the monetizations would provide clarity on NAV. I'm wondering if you can share with us the Board's of view of the current NAV of the Company?","John Perry","The Board's view is that it was substantially above the offer that was on the table.","Michael Bilerman","Hi Art it\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. Good morning. Just a question I remember at the Investor Day when you did the deal with Cadillac and they took stock in the enterprise, in the Company. You had said that the that the desire was for them go up to 15% and that they wanted to go up to 15%. I'm just curious why hasn\u2019t happened yet and is there any reason why it hasn\u2019t happened?","Art Coppola","Well there was an announcement today after we did that deal with them that kind of put them into a difficult position in terms of being able to buy stock. But what we did is what they asked for a waiver to go up to 2014 and change. We gave them a waiver and I can\u2019t there have been probably periods of time that they may have been precluded from buying stock during the recent events that you could imagine that could be part of the case.","So going forward, I have no idea what they are going to do. They have the right to buy shares to go up to a certain number. It\u2019s really their choice, and they will make that decision on their own.","Michael Bilerman","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler ONeil.","Art Coppola","Good morning Alexander.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey morning out there, Just a question here going back to the margin. First, is 400 basis points, is that the most that you think you can improve, or you think you can improve it further? And what are the hindrances sort of in the near-term over the next 24 months; what would be the hindrances to you hitting that 400 basis points? I understand obviously 100 is already in the bag, but what is the hindrance to getting that other 300?","Tom OHern","The only hindrance would be our imagination. But you having said that look we\u2019ve got a big wakeup call on this. We sat down and we said can we do things better and smarter here and through multiple, multiple thoughts we came to the conclusion that we can. To me now 400 is not the end game, it is just what I can feel comfortable saying that I see us being able to accomplish in this - on just one metrics over the next 24 months. I could tell you that with my operating team the significantly higher number just in terms of revenue generation that I see that we can achieve over the next 2 years to 5 years and I\u2019m sure that they will accomplish it.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And just a follow-up question. On the Sears [indiscernible] the other two peers made a $33 million investment in Seritage. Do you guys make the same or was that not in the release or you guys didn't have to do that?","Art Coppola","We did not have to do that.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola ","I am not saying - it very well could be a great investment, but it might be but it was not part of our deal.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thanks.","Art Coppola ","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Hi, thanks.","Tom OHern","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Sakwa","Hi, good morning. Two questions, one, I noticed that the property management company loss widened between 1Q 2014 and 1Q 2015 by about $6 million. I'm just wondering were there any sort of - I won't say accounting changes - but were there any differences that you guys did? Was there anything because of the joint venture that might have changed classifications? What sort of explains that $6 million swing?","Tom OHern","Well, it is primarily timing. First quarter is the bonus payment and a lot of the bonus payments are tied to total shareholder return and 2014 was a very good year. So bonuses were bigger for the management team than they were the prior year. That\u2019s the biggest difference there.","Steve Sakwa","So that large swing of $6 million is largely bonus payments?","Tom OHern","It\u2019s not the whole thing, it is about 60% of it and then there is a variety of other things in there. It will even out over the course of the year. That is just a one quarter anomaly.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess, Art, just going back to the asset sales and sort of trying to I guess put some markers on the board, can you just sort of maybe talk about the potential timing of those? Are those transactions that may take place in the next three months, by the end of the year or over the next 12 months? Just help us sort of frame out the timing of when these transactions may actually transpire.","Art Coppola","This year, if I gave you a date you could imagine that would put me at a disadvantage in negotiating with the counterparty, but definitely this year. And the conversations are active, but nothing is on the market.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess just the last question as you think about kind of renovations and expansions\u2026","Art Coppola","This is definitely your bonus question, Steve.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, I\u2019ll make it quick. Just in terms of renovations and expansions, you've got a large sort of shadow pipeline of A projects. But are you thinking about that pipeline differently today as we move into the cycle or five, six years in? Are you doing things differently, are you kind of derisking? What\u2019s kind of changed in your thought process?","Art Coppola","Well, good question. I'm glad you asked it. So the - I think that we have made a decision a few years ago, but clearly it is validated today that the best possible place we can put our money is into proven winners. So our focus is going to be on the redevelopment and expansion of proven winners and I think by doing that you derisk the investment, so definitely proven winners is supposed to ground-up.","And I think that as you think about the pipeline, the announcement with Sears that really opens up a whole new avenue of opportunities to reposition nine of the centers that we own here, so we\u2019re very pleased with that. And I think there will be other rationalizations that we will - now that we\u2019ve have been successful on this one, that we will enter into with Sears, so proven winners. I think by doing that you derisk the investment and pre-leasing obviously. Thanks, Steve. Next question.","Operator","We will take a follow-up from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It is Michael Bilerman. Just in terms of the fashion outlets and marquis, the project you did with [indiscernible] are the supplementals you did 100 to 125 - which was the incremental spend above and beyond the 106.8 that you put in. How should we think about the blended return on the entire capital stack that you expect?","Art Coppola","Michael, The way to look at the 106 is we currently are going to be getting even after a lot of the retail has been stripped out of there - there is going to be our share of the NOI is about $4 million. There is an office building there that continues to operate Century 21 continues to operate and that was all part of the 106. So if you take the 106 at a $4 million or so $4.5 million, you can factor that in and do the math. It probably takes it down to around an 8 or 8.5, But that will","Tom OHern","But that would be an interrupted NOI.","Art Coppola","That is still just an estimate, Mike. As we get deeper into it, we will refine, refine, refine that estimate and then it could change.","Christy McElroy","And then I just wanted to come back to the NAV and the Street sell side NAVs are anywhere from 75 to 80. So there is clearly a disconnect between that and whatever the unsolicited bid was and what room it had in it. I am curious what you could share with us and I know you are going to go through these joint venture conversations and special sale discussions but in the volume of work that Estill and Goldman and J.P. Morgan and Deutsche that you spent $13 million on, I'm sure that there's a lot of good nuggets of information that is in there that potentially could shed light and help us help investors narrow that gap.","And so I'm curious if there is anything else that you could do to shed more light other than - because I think selling happened just in the mall may be giving you upside, right? You don't want to do that either and you\u2019ve talked about that in the past so I'm just curious is there anything else you can sort of divulge or present to the Street?","Art Coppola","Sure. I feel like we already have but I also feel like people haven't heard us. We gave out a number that is not a GAAP number, not an FFO number, but is a number that is what a buyer and a seller would normally focus upon if you were buying or selling this collection of assets and that number was $1.43 billion that Estill did present and we presented to our Board. Estill said look, if we were selling these assets, this is the forward 12-month cash flow that we would expect the buyer to pay for. So if you take that real estate income which again that\u2019s a disclosure that you are not going to find it in our supplement, it is not a GAAP number, it\u2019s a number people would use in the buying or selling of properties.","And then you can apply different cap rates to that number. If you want to apply the cap rate that are unsolicited buyer, bidder apply to our historical NOI of a 4-cap rate, you do the math and that takes you up between $112 and $115 a share. If you want to take a 4.5-cap rate, it takes you to around $95 a share. And then look, one thing I do know is that everybody has an opinion on cap rates and they are entitled to that opinion. So I think the most important number that we have shared that I'm not sure that people have really, really focused on is the number that a buyer and a seller would expect to use in transacting on this portfolio and then you apply whatever cap rate to that, that you want.","Michael Bilerman","Right, and then there is the whole issue of control premium, the development, the redevelopment and all the sorts of things that would roll into perception of value as well.","Art Coppola","I would leave you to go ahead and decide what control premium you would add to that, what development value you would add to that. Again I would reiterate that Estill did not have to try and get into projecting out developments that are down the road. This was very much an as is static type of number and our development pipeline would be incremental to that and people would value that but obviously that is more speculative in variance.","Michael Bilerman","Thanks Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take follow-up from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.","Jim Sullivan","Thanks. Yes, I have a question on Santa Monica Place, Art. Looking over the productivity and the occupancy changes that you break out in the sup, clearly over the last year Santa Monica Place has improved the productivity kind of more than the portfolio average and it has had a nice gain in occupancy. I know you have the theater planned I think in fourth quarter of this year. I just wonder the third floor has always been kind of the problem at that center. It is where you have had the biggest kind of changeover in terms of tenants and still seems to be a work in progress. I wonder if you could just tell us in anticipation of the theater growing in, what the prospects are and whether you have been able to tie up any leases for that space that has been problematic already?","Art Coppola","Yes, big question. I\u2019m going to ask Bob Perlmutter to address that because my blood pressure goes up when you ask me about Santa Monica Place.","Bob Perlmutter","Jim, this is Bob Perlmutter. As you pointed out, the third floor has clearly experienced the most turnover at the center. Not surprising given its orientation toward restaurants which are not always as predictable as apparel or other types of retail. The key change is the theater and the theater impacts we believe not only this particular center but the entire market which is devoid of a first class theater presentation. Getting them up on the third floor will be the key to build momentum around them. Probably the most important impact we have seen is Cheesecake Factory which as you know also requires a lot of volume and a lot of bodies going through their space.","They have signed a lease for 12,000 feet, they are under construction. They will open at the same time as the theater. And from that, we are able to build both traditional restaurant uses which we will probably announce a couple more before the end of the year as well as another entertainment use up there that we hope to announce before the end of the year.","Art Coppola","And just to add to that, we did take a chance six years ago with some less creditworthy restaurant type of concept. So the Cheesecake Factory obviously is a credit, so then and the other entertainment use that Bob is referring to I think has significant credit also.","Bob Perlmutter","And obviously Cheesecake is pretty discerning in their real estate decisions and they told us they only have one other location that is on the third floor of a shopping center. So obviously they see great potential both in the Santa Monica market as well as with the theater there.","Jim Sullivan","One other food type question while we are on it, I wonder if you could share with us regarding the Eataly lease in Chicago, do you have percentage rent on that?","Art Coppola","We do.","Jim Sullivan","Good. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Linda Tsai with Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Your sales productivity at $607 per square foot is better than your peers and keeps growing. Do you have any view of what sales per square foot could look like in two to three years? Like is this something you spend time forecasting?","Art Coppola","I could predict sales, weather or interest rates I think I do something other than - I think my golf game would get better. I will tell you and not to make light of your question. The tactical moves that we make towards improving our sales is the constant and vigilant process of weeding out the bottom one-third of our portfolio that tends to do sales volumes at significantly lower than our averages.","So I have thrown out numbers before and I'm not fresh on them today. But if our portfolio is doing $607 a foot that\u2019s probably the result of one-third of our tenants doing $300 a foot and one-third of them doing $600 a foot and another one-third of them doing$1000 a foot. But a lot of what we do every day is we don't wait for the leases to expire and we are constantly in the process of trying to recycle unproductive tenants out and bring in tenants that we believe will do better than the mall average.","That is how we get our sales to go up. [indiscernible] We don't try influence consumer spending necessarily other than by giving them the merchandise that they want. We cannot influence people\u2019s disposable income but we can influence the productivity by always trying to bring in winners that can produce volumes that are above the mall average. I\u2019m sorry - I cut you off on the balance of your question.","Linda Tsai","I was just asking like with more asset sales, could that potentially hasten the process of increasing sales per square foot faster?","Art Coppola","Sure, that happens but that is not the goal of - the goal of asset dispositions is not to manipulate the average sales per foot. The goal of the asset dispositions is to identify and look it is largely done but is to identify low growth businesses and to redeploy that capital in the high growth businesses.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you very much and we all appreciate you joining us on our call. We appreciate your input and we are all available to you any time that you want to talk further about anything that we talked about today. So thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation."],"13971":["Macerich Co.

Today's conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Jean Wood","Thank you, Amy. Welcome everyone to the second quarter 2019 earnings call. During the course of this call, we will be making certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC which are posted in the Investor section of the Company's website at macerich.com.","Joining us today, are Tom O\u2019Hern, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Kingsmore, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean, and thank all of you for joining us today. It was a good quarter with solid operating metrics. Sales per foot were up 12% to $76 per square foot as our 13th consecutive quarter of sales growth. On an NOI weighted basis, sales were up 11% to almost $900 per foot. Occupancy was strong at 94%. Average rents were up 4%. ","We had a very good leasing volume quarter, looking at the year-to-date numbers, we are up almost 30% compared to last year. It is a good and improving leasing environment far better than the headlines would lead you to believe. FFO per share was $0.88 exceeding consensus in our guidance. ","Last week, we declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to shareholders of record on August 19th and payable September 6th. We had a few questions about our plan for the dividend given the current high dividend yield. I would like to make it very clear, we have no intention of cutting our dividend. ","Today we are fortunate to have an unprecedented number of new retailers and non-traditional users for space in our town centers. That includes Coworking where we have recent or in-process deals with Industrious we work in spaces. ","There is significant demand from these names and others for locations in A quality town centers . Industrious who recently opened its Scottsdale Fashion Square enjoyed the best opening occupancy level in their history proof that Coworking can thrive in a mall setting. ","We have growing demand from fitness and health users, particularly the high-end operators such as Equinox and Lifetime, both of which we have done recent deals with. Digitally native brands continue to be active. The brands as they refer to themselves as continue to migrate to A quality mall space. The generation of Peloton, UNTUCKit, Bonobos, and Warby Parker had a greater demand today than ever for brick-and-mortar. The new generation of digital brands such as Morphe, Casper, and Indochino, continue to increase their mall presence and have significant open to buys for brick-and-mortar.","Entertainment users continue to expand. Demand for quality space comes from tenants like Round One, Pinstripes, The Void, REC Room, as well as increasing demand for presence in our centers by theater operators including Harkins, AMC and Alamo Drafthouse. ","Hotels continue to seek space on the permanent river centers. That's evidenced by the recent signing of a deal with Caesars Republic at Scottsdale Fashion Square and in fact, last we approved three hotel ground lease deals at Marriott, a Hotel Indigo and a Hyatt. ","Our redevelopment pipeline is progressing very well including our prospects for the replacement of the Sears stores that we have been able to recapture. ","We now have control of ten Sears locations, seven of which are in a 50:50 joint venture with Seritage and that includes Los Cerritos, Washington Square, Vintage Faire, Chandler, Arrowhead, Deptford and South Plains Mall, plus we have two locations that are holding on.","Details of our Sears redevelopment plans are more fully described on Page 32 of our supplement. We have characterized these Sears redevelopments into two major categories. The first category is retail redevelopment and that represents an adaptive reuse of the existing Sears boxes with primarily retail uses.","We estimate redevelopment cost of approximately $80 million to $95 million for these projects with deals ranging from 8% to 9%. ","The second category is mixed use densification, which will result in a demolition of the Sears box and redistribution of that GLA with new construction across the Sears parcel with a variety of different non-traditional mall uses. We estimate the cost for those projects to be between $100 million to $120 million with yields ranging between 8.5% and 10%. ","This grouping includes Washington Square and Los Cerritos, both projects that are currently going through the entitlement process. Those are both great assets and ranking our top-10. Washington Square will feature a street scape entertainment district with a theater, large format entertainment, dining, select retail or hotel in potentially Coworking.","Los Cerritos will feature multi-family, a ground leased hotel, dining and retail elements, all interconnected by Town Square. The pre-leasing for the Sears pipeline of project is very strong. We will continue to announce anchors and significant tenants for these projects over the coming quarters. ","The array of uses will provide a very diverse cash flow and will significantly exceed the productivity and traffic generation from the former Sears boxes.","Looking at the balance of our redevelopment pipeline, at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Apple Industrious are thriving in the form of Barney's box. That's generated a tremendous amount of retail interest and customer energy. The newly renovated re-tenanted luxury wing continues to add exciting new brands as the year progresses. ","By the end of the first quarter 2020, our diverse roster of high-end restaurants will be fully opened and we anticipate Equinox and Caesars Republic to open in the first half of 2021. As a result of Scottsdale\u2019s multi-faceted redevelopment, we continue to see extremely strong sales growth and customer traffic. Comp sales are up 21% and foot traffic is up 7%, all year-to-date. ","Leasing demand continues to surpass our initial expectations. The redevelopment has thus far resulted in signed deals for 36 new or renovated stores that includes 21 new tenants, and 15 remodeled or relocated stores. ","New tenants to the property of digitally native brands such as UNTUCKit, Peloton, Indochino, Casper, Tommy John, Ring and Morphe and an array of luxury retailers such as Cartier, Gucci, St. John, Jimmy Choo, IWC and Saint Laurent. We also have a flagship lululemon and Wonderspaces. ","At the Fashion District of Philadelphia, tenant construction is progressing within the four-level retail and entertainment hub standing over 800,000 square feet in the heart of Philadelphia. ","The project will provide the city with its most concentrated critical mass of retail, taking advantage of mass transit that feeds directly into the concourse level of the project and the billions of commercial investment that has already occurred and is planned for future development in the City Center. ","We have signed commitments with tenant for 90% of the leasable space, including Century 21,","Burlington, H&M, Nike, Forever 21, AMC, Round One, City Winery and Wonderspaces. The project will open in phases with the holiday occupancy expected to be approximately 70% and stabilized occupancy anticipated in 2020 \u2013 late 2020.","At the Los Angeles Premium Outlets site, the Carson Reclamation Authority continues its horizontal site work to support the project. Our 50-50 joint venture with Simon Property Group expects to commence vertical construction of Phase one in early 2020 with the planned opening in 2021. ","As I have mentioned before, we remain firm in our belief that in the long run our high-quality assets, primarily situated in dense urban markets, will thrive as the retail landscape continues to evolve.","This belief is supported by recently completed or in-process projects like Kings Plaza and Scottsdale Fashion Square. At these properties, we continue to benefit from the retailer demand across the entire property as a result of our redevelopment investments.","We will undoubtedly realize similar benefits at many of our Sears projects and this is a specially pronounced at those projects where we are adding densification in a center place to the Sears parcel. We view these as great opportunities and we will continue to deploy capital in a prudent manner to capitalize on these opportunities. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Scott to discuss the results for the quarter. ","Scott Kingsmore ","Thank you, Tom. The second quarter reflected good financial results exceeding expectations. Here are some highlights for the quarter. FFO was $0.88 per share, which was $0.02 ahead of both our guidance and consensus estimates of $0.86 per share. ","This compares favorably to FFO for the second quarter of 2018, which was $0.83 per share. The primary elements of the $0.05 improvement during the second quarter were the one-time activism costs incurred in the second quarter of 2018 totaling $0.13, offset by $0.04 of dilution from greater leasing expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2019 due to the new lease accounting standard, as well as $0.03 of dilution from increased interest expense given a higher interest rate environment in the second quarter of 2019 relative to the second quarter of 2018. ","Year-to-date, FFO exceeds consensus by $0.03 per share. Same-center net operating income growth was up 0.9% for the quarter and is up1.3% to-date, which does exceed our 0.5% to 1% same-center NOI guidance for 2019. ","Margins continue to show significant improvement. The EBIT margin for the quarter improved by 118 basis points to 65.25%. Year-to-date EBITDA margins were up nearly 130 basis points through June 30 versus the first six months of 2018. This is a function of the entire team's relentless focus to produce efficiencies, both from an operating perspective and at a corporate level. ","With respect to 2019 earnings guidance, at this time, we are reaffirming our guidance for both FFO per share diluted and for same-center net operating income and we direct you to the Company's Form 8-K supplemental financial information for more details of the Company's guidance assumptions. ","Regarding our financing activity, the following summarizes the current status of our 2009 plans. In June, we closed a $220 million, 10 year fixed rate financing on SanTan Village in Gilbert, Arizona, at a fixed rate of 4.3%. ","The transaction produced $85 million of incremental proceeds of Macerich\u2019s share. Also in June, we closed a $256 million, five-year fixed rate financing on Chandler Fashion Center in Chandler Arizona, at a fixed rate of 4.1% yielding $28 million of incremental proceeds of Macerich\u2019s share. ","Our joint venture in One West Side is negotiating terms on a bank construction loan which is expected to have very attractive economics and terms and is expected to finance the partnership's remaining incremental cost to deliver the redevelopment of this creative office campus to Google. ","Our joint ventures in both the residential tower at Tysons Corner, known as Tysons Vita and the new office tower, known as Tysons Tower, are negotiating terms for a 10-year, fixed rate loans on both of these assets, both of which are currently unencumbered. ","Fixed interest rates on these two separate deals are expected at the very attractive levels in the mid-3% range and combined incremental proceeds of the company\u2019s share should exceed $140 million and both loans are expected to close near the end of this third quarter. ","We are currently at market to source financing opportunities on the recently redeveloped Kings Plaza in Brooklyn with consumer traffic trending up and sales up 7% year-to-date to 737 per square foot, Kings Plaza is reaping the benefits of our recent redevelopment investments and we do anticipate a very positive market reception for financing this property. We expect the deal the close within the fourth quarter. ","Collectively, these financings represent a nine asset financing plan for 2019 which is progressing quite well and that when complete, we expect to exceed $2 billion in volume and to generate over $600 million on liquidity to the company. ","Looking forward, over the next several years, we do anticipate incremental financing proceeds of $250 million to $400 million per year. Today we have over $700 million of capacity on our revolving line of credit, which is $1.5 billion in total and expandable up to $2 billion. This is more than enough liquidity to fund our ongoing development and redevelopment pipeline. ","Now I will turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment. ","Doug Healey","Thanks, Scott. In the second quarter, sales and occupancy remained strong and the leasing momentum continued. Portfolio sales ended the second quarter at $776 per square foot, which represented a 12.1% increase from $692 per square foot on a year-over-year basis. Economic sales per square foot which are weighted based on NOI were $896 per square foot and that\u2019s up 11.3% from $805 per square foot a year ago. ","Quarter end occupancy was 94.1%, that\u2019s down 0.2% from the end of the second quarter 2018 and down 0.6% from the end of the first quarter 2019. Trailing 12 month leasing spreads were 9.4%, compared to a 11.1% at December 31, 2018. Average rent for the portfolio was $61.17, and that\u2019s up 4% from $58.84 one year ago. ","Consistent with the first quarter, leasing volumes remained extremely strong in the second quarter. During the second quarter, 208 leases were signed for a total of 729,000 square feet bringing the year-to-date total to 1.6 million square feet. This represents 42% more leases and 29% more square feet than at this point last year. ","The large format space remains active. We signed an 85,000 square foot lease with Lifetime Fitness at The Oaks, we signed ALDI in 22,000 square feet at Green Acres Commons, Round 1 Bowling in 66,000 square feet at Freehold Raceway Mall and Industrious in 31,000 square feet at Country Club Plaza. ","And so, this is our third deal with Industrious they are currently open at Scottsdale Fashion Square and under construction at Broadway Plaza. ","We remain bullish on Coworking concept and believe the number and the demographic of their member base is extremely complementary and accretive to our town centers. We also signed multiple deals with the digital emerging brands including Warby Parker at Corte Madera, J. McLaughlin at Biltmore and Indochino at Broadway Plaza and Scottsdale Fashion Square. ","In the food and beverage category, we signed leases with Shake Shack at San Tan and Green Acres, Hook & Reel at Green Acres and Goddess and the Baker at North Bridge. We also signed a nice six store package with A&F\u2019s emerging brand Abercrombie Kids, where we captured six of their 15 2019 open-to-buys.","Lastly, in terms of executing leases, it was another great quarter for the Fashion District of Philadelphia. We signed 14 leases totaling 63,000 square feet including Aeropostale, American Eagle, Eddie Bauer, Express, GameStop, Pandora and Wonderspaces. We opened 64 new tenants in the second quarter totaling a 154,000 square feet. ","In the experiential category, in addition to Crayola at Chandler and Wonderspaces at Scottsdale both of whom opened in the second quarter, we are very pleased to welcome the Cayton Children's Museum to Santa Monica Place. It opened in 20,000 square feet on June 30 to enormous fanfare as it\u2019s the only one of its kind in all of Los Angeles. ","The Cayton Children's Museum is a state-of-the-art museum that has several interactive exhibits which are continuously refreshed and changed out. It also has party facilities, child care camps and many other amenities that will make it an integral part of our community. ","We love the customer bring it to Santa Monica Place and have already seen the positive impact it has had on traffic and food sales. The museum anticipates in excess of 300,000 visitors a year. ","Now turning to the leasing environment, despite what the media might report, the leasing environment remains dynamic. A great indication of this is that, year-to-date our bankruptcy closings have totaled 2% of our total occupancy. ","However, as I have already stated, our total occupancy is only down 0.2% from Q2 2018. Now without a strong leasing environment, there is no doubt we would have seen greater occupancy loss as a result of these bankruptcy closings. ","And never has the breadth of uses in categories been so great. As our malls and shopping centers continue to morph into town centers they are becoming everything for everybody. And this is because our shoppers changing. The next generation wants it all and they want it all in one place.","Therefore, we no longer focus only on traditional retailers. Now it\u2019s all about uses and categories. It\u2019s about large format uses like Dick's Sporting Goods and T.J. Maxx and Target. It's about restaurants like Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack and True Food Kitchen. It's about fitness like Lifetime, Equinox and 24 Hour. ","It\u2019s about theaters and entertainment like Harkins, Cinemark, Dave & Buster's, Round One and REC Room. It\u2019s about experiential like Candytopia, Crayola and Wonderspaces. And it\u2019s about digital like Casper, Morphe and Madison Reed. And it\u2019s about Coworking like Industrious, WeWork and Spaces. ","But this is by way of example only, this what\u2019s goes on. But these are all categories and users that are active and we are working with each and every one of them. My point is, as we continue to weed out the underperforming and irrelevant retailers, we no longer have to rely on backfilling with traditional retail-only. The market won\u2019t tolerate it and candidly our shopper wants more. ","Our ability to recapture space especially in our best-in-class centers is going to be critical as we look to accommodate all of these users and all of these categories. So whoever is looking at our industry should be looking at us through this lens. This is an exciting transformation that will result in world-class town centers that will soon be \u2013 to everybody. ","So in conclusion, our leasing metrics including sales, occupancy and spreads remains solid. Leasing volumes are strong. We continue to lease space to new, exciting and cutting-edge retailers. Categories and users continue to expand and we continue to merchandise our properties with offerings that are among the best in the industry. ","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jim Sullivan with BTIG. ","Jim Sullivan ","Thank you. Tom, and Doug, I guess, for this first question, the temporary tenancy number rose back in the first quarter. You detailed that in the call. And I wonder if you could just update us on what percentage of the occupancy is temporary as of the end of the second quarter and how you expect that number to change in the coming quarters?","Scott Kingsmore","Hey, Jim. This is Scott. Good morning. Yes, the current temp occupancy remains elevated relative to historical expectations where it\u2019s 6.5% temp occupied today. I would expect that perhaps to tick up another 10, 20 basis points or so until the end of the year as we continue to backfill the bankruptcy closures that we saw from the first half of the year. ","But just to point out, and I think I have emphasized this in multiple meetings, we do view that as a great opportunity going forward to convert short-term uses into longer-term higher rent paying tenants at full market rents. ","We should see significantly elevated rents and I think that will be an important critical operating cash flow tailwind for us over the next couple of years. But in summation, I do expect it to tick up, but just a bit more for the balance of the year, Jim. ","Jim Sullivan ","I just have a one follow-up and your last comment kind of provides a good segue for that. Again, in the last quarter, it was indicated that same-property NOI growth for 2020 no firm numbers were provided. ","However, I think the comment was that the expectation at the end of the first quarter in this respect is that, same-property NOI growth should return to more historic levels which had been 3% plus in 2020. And 90 days on here, I am just curious if management is still confident in that assessment?","Scott Kingsmore","I\u2019d say that\u2019s true, Jim. As we go through the balance of this year, we have some tough comps on a same-center basis in the third and fourth quarter. But as we are moving through the backfilling the bankruptcies, we are most all the way through there. We think we are going to pick up some momentum as we finish up the year. ","Jim Sullivan ","Good. Thank you. ","Operator","With Evercore ISI, we\u2019ll hear from Samir Khanal","Samir Khanal ","Hi, good morning. As we think about the leasing environment and then you guys have had a very good job from the volume standpoint. As we think about your watch list and sort of your tenant restructuring is going on. ","I mean, I guess, how much more is left there that we would say would be sort of bad news or concern here? Everybody talks about 100 basis points of credit loss reserve that\u2019s been used and if you kind of think through the next two to three years, is that kind of the new normal or does that come down?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, Samir. This is Scott. Good morning. We \u2013 if I look at our opening commentary when we issued guidance, we did have roughly 100 basis points of cushion in our numbers. As I look forward, for the balance of the year, we do feel like we\u2019ve got adequate reserves embedded within our guidance for the balance of the year just to point that out. ","And that\u2019s for every tenant that\u2019s in front of us, large and small and otherwise. We do see our watch list at a much significantly reduced level from we were a few years ago. So, it\u2019s hard to say, but as we stand here today, given the perspective we have, it does seem like, it\u2019s going to be a lessening environment versus what it\u2019s been historically. ","Again, none of these bankruptcies are a surprise to us. The brands that have failed or brands that had too much debt on their balance sheet or were long underperformers within our portfolio. So none of this has been a surprise, but we do see the list shrinking. But I think the fundamental point is we do see 2019 not being negatively impacted from what we see today relative to our guidance. ","Samir Khanal ","Okay. And I guess, just as a follow-up, can you walk us, I guess, Scott, can you walk us through your NOI guidance? I mean, you are tracking ahead of schedule. You kept the guidance the same, It implies a deceleration in the second half. You've talked about a strong leasing environment and I am just trying to see how much of it is you just being conservative versus sort of real concerns kind of from a tenant fall out perspective in the second half. ","Scott Kingsmore","Sure, Samir. Naturally, with the heavy volume of bankruptcies we\u2019ve seen over 400,000 square feet close within the first half of the year. And so, those closures are naturally going to have a drag on the second half and so we do have that embedded within our thinking. When we frame the impact of the bankruptcies, just to kind of put this in perspective, year-to-date, we\u2019ve seen elevated bad debts. ","You guys recognize that we did increase our bad debt assumption within our guidance. We are seeing elevated bad debts of roughly $1 million per quarter as a result of write-offs or prepetition rents from rejected leases of bankrupt tenants. ","In addition, we have seen lots of rental income from those bankrupt tenants and we expect that to continue during the second half of the year. If I were to look at the impact of bankruptcy as a whole on 2019, both between bad debts, as well as reduced rental income, I would frame the impact of roughly 175 to 200 basis points of impact on the same-center NOI for 2019. ","So, that\u2019s really what our perspective bankruptcies have had the impact. That will give you an idea of what the sense of the impact is in terms of order of magnitude and we do expect that will have an impact on the second half. ","Samir Khanal ","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Todd Thomas ","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Samir\u2019s question. How much Sears rent did you collect in the quarter that needs to come out for \u2013 of the 3Q runrate? And were there other tenants that moved out to that you collected rent from in the second quarter that would have an impact going forward? ","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, sure. I don\u2019t have that number quantified. Sears, we did collect roughly month-and-a-half of rent that will be going away. That does not impact center, recall we were clear that we did pull the Sears impact out of same-center just as we will pull the redevelopment returns once we do restore the income that will be pulled out of same-center. ","For the most part, most of the bankruptcy closures were done by the end of the first quarter. There were some that\u2019s filled in April, but I think for the most part, we\u2019ve seen the impact as of the end of the first quarter. ","There is a little bit trickling in. I don\u2019t see a huge impact though from either one of those and also bear in mind from Sears, you\u2019ve got the offsetting impact of placing the developments or the cost into development which you\u2019ve got the non-cash benefit of capitalized interest put all that into the mix, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material impact. ","Todd Thomas ","Okay, right. And then, Scott, and maybe, Tom you can chime in here as well. But you outlined the refinancing plans in detail which was helpful. But can you comment on the potential to raise capital at some point, maybe later this year from the sale of one or more assets either outrider in a joint venture format? Just any current thoughts on that process which you sort of talked about previously?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, Todd. We are currently active in discussions regarding several joint venture transactions that would generate a significant amount of capital. We continue to negotiate those and at this point, nothing more specific to report. But we will keep you posted as we move forward with those.","Todd Thomas ","Okay, in terms of timing, is it something that that might take place in 2019? Or do you think that this ends up being a 2020 transaction?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, ideally, these are multiple negotiations on multiple properties and given that this would probably generate a significant amount of capital gain, ideally we\u2019d like to close a part of these transactions in late 2019 and the balance carrying over to the beginning of 2020. ","Todd Thomas ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Barclays, we will hear from Linda Tsai. ","Linda Tsai","Hi, in terms of the impact of closures on same-store for 2019, you said it was a 175 to 200 BPS. For context, could you remind us what the impact was in 2018 and also 2017, which was a bigger year in terms of closures?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, Linda, in 2017, we had total square footage of 970,000 square feet. So almost twice of what it was today. And then it abated a little bit in 2018 for the year excluding the department stores that was 565,000 and that compares to where we are today at 512,000 square feet and about 80% of those leases were rejected. So, it has tapered off compared to 2017. ","Linda Tsai","But in terms of like a basis point impact on the same-store?","Scott Kingsmore","If I were to look at 2018, generally, a lot of that square footage that Tom just rattled off was anchors. So it was Sears, it was Bonton, there was less on the small shop area. So it\u2019s probably less of the same-center impact in 2018 than it was in 2019, which was predominantly small shop square footage. ","So, same-center was heavily impacted. I don\u2019t have a figure for you off-hand. Linda, we can take that offline if you like. But I don\u2019t have a figure. But again, in terms of order of magnitude, I think 2017 was much more heavily impacted in terms of same-center NOI than 2018. ","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And in terms of the increase in bad debt from $0.03 to $0.05, does this include Forever 21 and Barney\u2019s?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","No, this really is a function of writing our prepetition rents for the brands that have closed already. So it\u2019s the things remembered in Payless and Charlotte Russe and all the Gymboree brands as well as a random scattering of others. There is nothing to do with the other retailers that you mentioned. ","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then just one last one, in terms of temporary occupancy, you said it was 6.5% where do you think it will be at year end and at what point would you expect it to come down?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, again, I think it will tick up a bit towards the end of the year as I mentioned to Mr. Sullivan. I would expect that however to really start coming down over the next couple of years, it\u2019s natural to assume that as we get 400,000 square feet back, that we are going out of a combination of permanent replacements, as well as opportunistic temporary replacements for that space. ","And so, I do think we\u2019ll see a significant conversion to longer-term higher rent paying uses in 2020 and 2021 and we\u2019ll see the operating impact \u2013 positive operating impact of that activity. So, again, a tick up towards the end of the year and then I would certainly see that dropping as we move forward. ","Linda Tsai","Thank you. ","Operator","From Bank of America we will hear from Craig Schmidt. ","Craig Schmidt ","I was looking in the sales per square foot chart and at listed centers and redevelopment of Paradise Valley. What is the redevelopment that you are doing at Paradise Valley?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, Paradise Valley, we\u2019ve got the potential to do mixed use, entertainment. The department stores are fairly productive there. But there is \u2013 it\u2019s very well located and there is a significant amount of demand for other uses. So that will probably be a combination of things. It won\u2019t be more retail, it\u2019d be less retail more around mixed use. ","Craig Schmidt ","Okay, great. I guess, in a similar vein, vein, the Sears that you recaptured at Towne Mall, with the lower sales per square foot productivity, would you expect that repurpose to be non-retail?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","It could be. We are still working on that one, Craig. For example at Wilton, which kind of falls in the same category, we\u2019ve got a hospital that\u2019s going to take that space and put in a medical office and a clinic and I would expect something similar to be the ultimate outcome at Towne. ","Craig Schmidt ","Great. Thank you. ","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Thanks, Craig. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Hey, good morning out there. Just two questions. First, Tom, on the JV front, to the earlier question, you said that it would generate large capital gains. So, just trying to think, I know you reaffirm the commitment to the dividend which we appreciate, but if you sell joint venture stakes, presumably earnings come down which I would think would affect the dividend. ","But if selling stakes in the malls is going to result in capital gains that may have to be distributed, why do that if you have the $250 million to $400 million a year incremental refinancing that from \u2013 as you refinance your malls, why wouldn\u2019t that be preferable to selling stakes in mall if it could pressure the dividend, but you may have to special dividend out?","Scott Kingsmore","Well, if the goal is to generate liquidity, we wouldn\u2019t get in a situation where we sold something that would trigger a special dividend. So, that\u2019s one reason you straddle the year-end with a transaction. So part of it will fall into the 2020 dividend and part of it would fall into 2019. From our standpoint, we\u2019ve got plenty of liquidity. ","But if we can achieve some favorable pricing on some of these transactions we are in discussions on then, it\u2019s a good way to generate some additional equity. And so that\u2019s what we are pursuing. But I do not think, no matter what we would do, it wouldn\u2019t result in a special dividend. It just might mean that the entirety of our current dividend is taxable. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, but I guess, also what you are saying is that, any JV would not impact the current dividend payout.","Scott Kingsmore","Well, if it\u2019s a $3 dividend today and on a normal circumstance is about 60% to 65% and that\u2019s ordinary income and that would mean that the other 35% or 40% is either going to be two things, it\u2019s going to be return of capital or it\u2019s going to be capital gain. So, if we execute on these JVs that other 40% of the current dividend would be a capital gain, not return to capital.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Right. But I guess, what I am saying is, if you JV something, you don\u2019t have the earnings moves out, but so FFO would go down. Wouldn\u2019t that necessitate resizing of the common dividend or not necessarily?","Scott Kingsmore","No, it would have no effect on the dividend. And it depends on the asset, a low cap rate asset isn\u2019t going to be dilutive to FFO. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay. And then, just second is for Scott, and maybe on mixing up my terms, so I apologize. You budget every year a 100 basis points for bad debt, but you said you are running 175 to 200 basis points. Am I mixing different parts of it or is it just that you are running ahead but because of all the leasings, you are still within the overall 100?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, so, just to clarify, coming into the year, we had a basket of reserves to account for all the bankruptcies that are in front of us. As the years progressed, our bad debts have been elevated by about 50 basis points versus what we anticipated. And frankly the bankruptcies were heavier than we anticipated too, Alexander. ","And that\u2019s really driven by the pace of closures roughly 80% of the over 500,000 square feet that did file ultimately closed. So, that was significantly in excess of what we thought. So, I guess, cutting through it, the impact was greater than what we anticipated. Yet, we are still affirming guidance. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","From Citi, we will hear from Christy McElroy.","Christy McElroy ","Hi, thanks good morning. Just following up on the Sears boxes, previously, you had talked about four of the wholly-owned that has closed that you thought you\u2019d get back, but I think you only got three. What happened to that other one that closed? ","And I am realizing that you pulled the boxes out of the same-store pool. But can you quantify the sort of residual \u2013 any residual co-tenancy impacts from these closures that could hit in Q3?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. There is one Sears that closed, Christy, that the lease has not been rejected yet. So we don\u2019t control that one yet. So that was the difference. And that on co-tenancy, it\u2019s very immaterial. ","Doug Healey","Yes, correct. I don\u2019t expect any co-tenancy impact from the closure of those boxes. ","Christy McElroy ","Okay. And then, with regard to the new disclosure on the Sears boxes in the redevelopment, thank you for that. Are the projected yield based on the incremental spend from here or is it incorporating also the full cost of the $150 million when you entered the Seritage JV and I am just sort of trying to do the math, if you start capitalizing the interest on that $150 million now, when the project start to come online, you will have the \u2013 you will get the benefit of the NOI. ","But it will also be partially offset by sort of that full impact of the expensing the interest previously capitalized both on the original cost and the incremental spend. ","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, Christy. Hi, it\u2019s Scott. The deals are based on incremental cost from here on out. They do not include the basis and just bear in mind that the basis for those nine Seritage boxes includes all nine centers. There were seven centers that we have under redevelopment, two that are going forward stores for Sears in which we have already repurposed half of the box. ","And so, you can really kind of a portion out the $150 million of total basis on a pro rata basis, 7 over 9 to figure out what\u2019s going to be capitalized and what\u2019s not.","Christy McElroy ","Okay. So how much of the $150 million is it sort of just doing the math of 7 out of the 9?","Scott Kingsmore","It\u2019s about a $115 million, $120 million off-hand. ","Christy McElroy ","Okay. Thank you. ","Scott Kingsmore","You bet. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. ","Shivani Sood","Hi, good afternoon. Just following up earlier on the earlier question on Forever 21 and Barney\u2019s and apologies if I missed this earlier. But is there any update you can share there from a store closure perspective or initial expectations with regards to Forever 21 specifically?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, we\u2019ve had multiple discussions with Forever 21 and their advisors. And at this point, we don\u2019t believe that any concessions that we are going to be making will be material. And we\u2019ve got 30 stores for them that\u2019s possible if a few might close. ","But it won\u2019t be significant to our overall rent and our guidance for 2019. Those discussions are underway. It\u2019s a little early to conclude anything yet, but based on what we\u2019ve heard from them we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be material. ","Shivani Sood","Okay. ","Tom O\u2019Hern ","And as the Barney\u2019s we have only two locations in the portfolio. So it\u2019s also not material. ","Shivani Sood","Excellent. And then, Doug you had mentioned the strong leasing demand and velocity in the quarter. Can you give us an idea of how much of the 2019 aspirations have been addressed and as you are looking to 2020 or 2021, has anything changed with how the Macerich team is looking to defensively get ahead of potential watch lists and on the renewal list?","Doug Healey","Yes, I would say, in terms of 2019, virtually all of the lease expirations have been addressed in one form or another. We either have signed leases or we are at lease. In terms of 2020, we are probably between 40% and 50% committed at this point. So, we are pretty far out ahead of 2020. ","Shivani Sood","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we will next hear from Nick Yulico with Deutsche Bank.","Nick Yulico ","Hi, Tom, I appreciate all the commentary about the dividend and how the company has no intention to cut the dividend, but if you look at your dividend yield today it\u2019s high and investors seem to be pricing your stock as if there is some risk of the dividend cut. So, what do you the market is missing about your ability over the next year or two to create better cushion on the current dividend?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, Nick, as I said, our AFFO covers the dividend. We are expecting accelerating same-center NOI growth going forward. And I also mentioned that given the JV transactions we are considering we probably will be generating some additional taxable income. So, we have no intention to cut the dividend and frankly if we do those JVs there is no room to cut. So, we are comfortable with where the dividend is today. ","Nick Yulico ","Thank you. Can you just remind us where you are at in terms of your taxable income versus your dividend?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, I mentioned that to Alex a minute ago. In a typical year, 60% or so of the dividend is ordinary income. And then the balance is either going to be return of capital or it\u2019s going to be capital gain. And in this particular year, given the transactions we are considering its most likely going to be capital gain not return of capital, which means the entire $3 dividend today would be taxable. ","Nick Yulico ","All right. That\u2019s helpful and just to be clear, I mean, when you are talking about the additional financings that you could do to raise funds over the next couple of years, does the JV sale \u2013 if that happens that allow you to not have to lever up so much?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, it depends on how you use those proceeds. Those proceeds could be used to delever. I mean, typically when we finance an asset, we finance it to a 55% to 60% loan-to-value and we\u2019ve always done that for the past 25 years as a public company and that\u2019s the way we would continue to finance our properties. ","These are mostly deals that are done with life companies. And so it\u2019s institutional underwriting and I don\u2019t think it would change our approach to financing whether we do the JVs or not. ","Nick Yulico ","Hey guys, I am just wondering how it\u2019s going to work from a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint if presumably a lot of this funding is going towards redevelopment of Sears or other situations where you not getting the EBITDA benefit right away. I mean, it seems like your debt-to-EBITDA there is some risk that your debt-to-EBITDA goes up over the next year.","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, if we do the JVs, Nick, we paid our debt, debt-to-EBITDA is going to go down. ","Nick Yulico "," But if you don\u2019t do them \u2013 if you don\u2019t pursue the JVs, should we assume that you are willing to take your debt-to-EBITDA up as a company?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Well, we look at a lot of things when it relates to the balance sheet. It\u2019s not just one metric. For example, if you look at the interest coverage ratio, it\u2019s a very healthy 3.3 times. If you look at the maturity schedule it\u2019s layered out very nicely at 5.2. If you were to use a more traditional leverage metric like loan-to-value, even using the consensus estimate for NAV, that would put loan-to-value at about 45% and that\u2019s not a level we are uncomfortable with. ","Nick Yulico ","All right. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate.","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Okay.","Operator","Next up is Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. ","Caitlin Burrows ","Hi there. I guess, I was just wondering on the redevelopment cost for the ten Sears boxes that you recaptured in the quarter, $250 million to $300 million, which I think was the cost anticipated as of last quarter for Sears redevelopment but that was for a larger set of stores, if that is the case I was wondering what changed about the redevelopment plans to bring the cost up and what\u2019s the status of the remaining six stores that were previously listed as in the shadow redevelopment pipeline? ","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, Caitlin, hi, it\u2019s Scott here. We have place \u2013 we don\u2019t have a place holder earmarked for future phases and I think our initial commentary starting last fall was $250 million to $300 million over several years. I don\u2019t think that thinking has necessarily changed. In terms of the projects that are in front of us between the two categories, both adaptive reuse as well as mixed use densification. ","That totals roughly, what do have, 180 to 205 and the balance really is future phases what you are probably going to be centered on some of the mixed use projects like Los Cerritos in the Washington Square. ","So, again, market-driven, we would anticipate that potentially we\u2019ll be spending some more money to densify those assets. Bear in mind also that we may be considering joint ventures with mixed use experts. So, it\u2019s really hard to pinpoint with clarity exactly how that\u2019s going to unfold. But $250 million to $300 million still seems right over several years in the context of what I just mentioned. ","Caitlin Burrows ","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s all. Thanks. ","Operator","With Green Street Advisors, we will hear from Vince Tibone.","Vince Tibone","Hey, good morning. Could you guys help me understand the components of same-property NOI growth in the second quarter? I mean, occupancy was down only modestly, base rent was up about 4%, spreads are good. I am just trying to get a sense of why same-property was only up 90 BPS. Can you help me bridge the gap there?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, I think the biggest impact is the closures, Vince. We have the impact on the closures from bankruptcies again 400,000 square feet, the lion share of which was already closed by the end of the first quarter is really what weighting us down from the same-center standpoint and just pointing back to the comments I made previously, bad debts are elevated. They were elevated by $1 million a quarter. That\u2019s a 50 basis point impact on each quarter. So that\u2019s part of it. ","And then you\u2019ve got the loss rental income associated with those as well, which is dragging us down. So, in aggregate, I mentioned it\u2019s a bracketed 175 to 200 basis point weight on the year. And I think that\u2019s what we saw in the second quarter as well. ","Vince Tibone","But didn\u2019t that flow through to occupancy or is it kind of \u2013 is it the temp tenancy that's up or maybe rent relief packages weighing down, I guess, I am still having trouble understanding, because everything should flow through occupancy eventually, correct and that was only down 20 basis points. ","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Yes, but Vince, you are correct. Temporary occupancy is part of it. Temporary occupancy is up almost a 0.5% over a year ago and typically on a temporary lease, we are going to get, if we are fortunate half the rent you would get on permanent lease. So that\u2019s why the big push to convert temporary to permanent. But that had bearing on the quarter as well. ","Vince Tibone","And then are you able to quantify rent relief impact in the quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","I don\u2019t think there was a significant amount of rent relief in the quarter. I mean, most of the bankruptcies filings or closures they weren\u2019t restructuring. ","Vince Tibone","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. ","Michael Mueller ","Yes, hi. Can you give us a sense as to how much lower debt-to-EBITDA could go because of the JV sales because would you be looking to something, say, a point or more?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Mike, I think that the range of equity we were talking about was in the range of $500 million to $600 million and that would move it down, probably 75 basis points to 100 depending on the amount of leverage on the individual asset, as well as the amount of equity we generate. ","Michael Mueller ","Got it. Okay. Thank you. ","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Thanks. ","Operator","From BMO Capital Markets, we\u2019ll hear from Jeremy Metz.","Jeremy Metz ","Hey, Tom, as you kind of think about the capital needs here, and leverage, and obviously talked about the joint venture, but where it is monetizing even more of the potential mix use optionality that you have in the portfolio fall into that playbook. You obviously have some great unused dirt. You mentioned signing a couple of hotel deals. So, is that a lever you are looking at and considering hitting even more?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","We always consider it. From our standpoint, on the hotel deals, it makes more sense for us to do ground lease deals, but we could also sell the land potentially. But those are all things we would consider, Jeremy.","Jeremy Metz ","All right. Doug, you mentioned the 2% bankruptcy impact and the minimal impact that ultimately had to occupancy. How much is actually getting that bankrupt space back in release? Or it\u2019s just other vacancy leasing up? For example, Queens going from 92% in the first quarter and 99% and that\u2019s just more leasing up space there versus replacing bankruptcies.","Doug Healey","Yes., just to put it in perspective, year-to-date, we\u2019ve had 13 bankruptcies totaling about 512,000 square feet. 82% of that or about 415,000 square feet was rejected and closed and as of today, we are about 54%, 55% committed in terms of leased. ","Jeremy Metz ","Thanks. ","Operator","And with Morgan Stanley, we will hear from Rich Hill. ","Richard Hill","Hey, good afternoon guys. Want to just quickly talk about the management fees. It looks like you\u2019ve done \u2013 you continue to do a pretty good job of bringing those down. How do you think we should think about those going forward? Is this sort of the steady state do you \u2013 there is more room to optimize that?","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Rich, we\u2019ve gone through some significant cuts both in terms of G&A as well as management company expenses. I think second quarter is probably a pretty good runrate for the year. ","Richard Hill","Got it. Thank you. ","Tom O\u2019Hern ","And that would be true not just management expenses, but also G&A, I think second quarter it\u2019s a good runrate. ","Richard Hill","Got it. Thank you. And then, if I am looking at other rental income for both consolidated and JV assets, it looks like that was down. Is there anything specific that drove the other rental income down? I guess, that\u2019s actually other rental income just for the consolidated assets. But is there anything that that drove that and is that sort of declines something we should think about or is it more one-off?","Scott Kingsmore","Are you referring to leasing revenue, Rich? Or are you referring to other income? I am not clear.","Richard Hill","No, I am referring to other rental income. I am sorry, I misspoke when I was referring to JV and consolidated. So, just focusing on other rental income and the consolidated properties?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes, I kind of look at it overall and it\u2019s fairly consistent when you look at the whole portfolio at share. And in fact, I think if you look the whole portfolio and share it\u2019s probably ticking up just to touch our business development. ","We do have a disclosure that shows business development income and that\u2019s up by about $1 million as a function of advertising and vending and parking revenue. And a lot of sundry sources. So, on an overall basis, not just consolidated, but on an overall basis, we see that actually elevated slightly. So, and I think that\u2019s just a function of our continued focus on driving ancillary revenue. ","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. Tom O\u2019Hern, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. ","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Amy. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing and speaking with many of you over the coming months and hope everybody has a great summer. Thank you. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

The second quarter reflected continued solid operating results as evidenced by most of our portfolio\u2019s key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $0.98 per share compared to $1.02 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. This was above our guidance range and above consensus and this was primarily due to the timing of lease termination revenues. Same-center growth and net operating income, excluding straight line rents and SFAS 141 income was up 3.3% for the quarter. Lease termination fees for the quarter were $9.1 million that compared to $5.9 million in the second quarter of last year. The largest term fees came in from Bebe at $3 million and Sperry at $2 million.","Year-to-date, lease term revenue is about $12 million, including our guidance assumptions, we revised that up to $17 million for the year but that\u2019s still less than we saw in 2016 when we had actual term \u2013 lease term revenue of about $21 million. The gross operating margin for the quarter was 70.4%, up slightly compared to 70.3% in the second quarter last year. Bad debt expense for the quarter was $2.5 million, up somewhat from the $1.7 million we incurred in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, bad debt expense is about $4.2 million and accordingly, we have increased our guidance for bad debt for the year to $6.5 million, up from $5 million.","Here in the second quarter, average interest rate was 3.6% and that compared to 3.52% a year ago. Bringing out the balance sheet, the balance sheet continues to be in good shape. At quarter end, debt-to-market cap was 46%. Interest coverage ratio was a very healthy 3.3x. The average debt maturity, just under 6 years, which is very strong and should improve over the course of the year as we finish financings in the second half of the year. Forward debt-to-EBITDA, 7.8x and our floating rate debt was at 17% of our total debt but this \u2013 based on our financing activities in the second half, this should go down to close to 10% by year end.","We plan to be very active in the financing market in the second half of the year. Rates are still very low and strong malls and financing market is good \u2013 the financing market is good for strong malls. The following financings planned on two unencumbered assets, Green Acres and Broadway Plaza and we also plan to refinance in the second half of the year, Freehold malls and Santa Monica Place. Total excess proceeds we expect to see from those 4 transactions is about $600 million. In addition, we are going to be at least considering financing some of our unencumbered assets in the second half of the year. Those assets could amount to as much as an additional $300 million of excess proceeds. So all-in-all, it could be close to $900 million and it\u2019s anticipated this time that most of the excess proceeds if not all, will be used to pay down or pay off our line of credit.","We were also active during the quarter on our share buyback program. We purchased an additional $40 million worth of stock, at an average price just over $59. Year-to-date, our buybacks have totaled $181.7 million and close to 3 million shares have been repurchased, or roughly 2% of our shares outstanding. In our earnings release yesterday, we reaffirmed our previously provided FFO guidance in the range of $3.90 to $4.00. There\u2019s more detail in the 8-K that was filed last night regarding the assumptions in addition to the 2 that I just mentioned in my earlier comments.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the leasing environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Our second quarter produced leasing results, which reflect both the current retail environment and the high-quality nature of the company\u2019s portfolio. Sales for our centers increased to $646 per square foot. The trailing 12-month leasing spreads increased to 18.5% from the first quarter rate of 17.5%. We are finding our top tier centers continue to have the greatest impact in the portfolio performance. Average rent per leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $58.08 per square foot, up from the first quarter rate of $56.93. During the second quarter, a total of 745,000 square feet of leases were signed, bringing total activity during the first two quarters to just under 1.3 million square feet.","Average term for leases signed in the second quarter was 5.9 years, which was an increase over the Q1 average of 5.2 years. Occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 94.4%. This represented a 60 basis point decrease on a year-over-year basis and a 10 basis point increase from the first quarter. Our temporary occupancy ended the second quarter at 5.7%. Portfolio sales were $646 per square foot. This represented a 3.2% increase on a year-over-year basis. On a same-center basis, sales were up 2.5% and sales weighted on an NOI basis were $754 per square foot.","Bankruptcies, to-date, there have been 12 tenant bankruptcies affecting 146 stores, containing 551,000 square feet. Of this amount, we are forecasting that 65 stores containing 228,000 square feet have or will close. While most of these closures have occurred prior to the end of the second quarter, there will be some additional store closings in the third quarter. Average sales for these stores were approximately $250 per square foot.","Merchandise mix. During our first quarter earnings call, we were asked about apparel\u2019s position within the merchandise mix of the centers. This is a common question we receive from the investment community. Specifically, there is a general belief that the square footage dedicated to apparel has declined and will continue to decline further in the coming years, causing additional vacancy and pressure on rents. While there are clearly significant changes in the apparel formats presented in the shopping center, the category remains a significant contributor to not only the existing tenant base, but also in regards to our annual leasing activity. While the industry uses different definitions for apparel, when we speak of the category, we include athleisure, children, unisex, men\u2019s, women\u2019s and intimates.","In 2011, apparel represented 40.2% of the non-anchor area. At the end of 2016, apparel declined to 37.8%. The real change that occurred during this period was the format being presented and the impact caused by the fast fashion retailers. During this 5-year period, the square footage occupied by apparel stores under 10,000 feet decreased by 12%. Almost half of this decline is attributed to the bankruptcies incurred since 2014. The dislocation in apparel brands has been the transition from smaller traffic-based stores to larger brand dominant presentations. To us, this makes sense as building a retailer\u2019s brand with larger presentations in dominant centers fuels online and off-price distribution points.","During the same 5-year period, there were other changes in the merchandise mix at the properties. We believe this represents the changing preferences of our consumers. Not surprisingly, square footage represented by restaurants increased by 7%, theaters grew by 17% and home furnishings expanded by 14%. Our conclusion is the shopping center tenant base is transitioning from smaller, weaker apparel formats, who historically were dependent on foot traffic into larger, more dominant global branded retailers. This competitive change, combined with online commerce is causing dislocation in the marketplace.","Longer term, we see the apparel category evolving, led by retailers presenting larger formats with stronger brand identity and better financial resources. This should bring more stability into the apparel tenant base. Since many of the larger format retailers are expanding from smaller store fleets, we continue to believe the new store activity will be disproportionately higher in the better quality centers. These changes in the existing tenant base, combined with growth in digitally native retailers and the introduction of new uses catering to changing lifestyle desires of our customers, will provide the support in the near-term to maintain our high occupancy levels.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Bobby and thanks, Tom. As you can see from our numbers, we continue to put up very strong operating results, which is a testimony to the great business that we have and the great locations that we have. Since our last call, there has been a daily, if not sometimes hourly, the rise of headlines predicting the death of great retail locations, the death of the mall is a common one and the death of brick-and-mortar based retailers. And from that, that is very painful to look at that. And I do share the pain of many when you look at those headlines, especially when you have conviction that they are not accurate. But I have absolutely no empathy for the shorts in the social media that are motivated for their own reasons to help to create this fake news in this barrage of headlines that incorrectly states where the retail business is and where the retail business is heading. It is very painful obviously for many of us and many of you as shareholders, to see the dramatic differentials that have been created between the true value of our businesses and the value that the markets attribute to them. And we feel that pain every year, given that senior management at Macerich, over half of our compensation is directly tied to the performance of our shares. But again, I have no empathy for the incorrect conclusions that the mall is dead and that it is in late innings or demising.","Since that is my conclusion, let\u2019s go ahead and just revisit what our model is and what are the dynamics of the future of our model. Our portfolio is comprised of owning the single best retail location in some of the best gateway markets in the United States. Our properties are, in fact, the last mile of retail distribution in some of the most densely populated and affluent markets in the U.S. The value of this model, I think to some degree, was enhanced and validated through the announcement in the last quarter that Amazon is going to stake a claim to that last mile with their purchase of Whole Foods. We own the number one gathering place for town square in each of these great markets. Rents and demand for our centers have been strong.","Let\u2019s look at the dynamics of supply and demand that dictate rents for any form of real estate. On the supply side, it is true that there will be virtually no new malls or significant retail centers built in any of the gateway markets that we own. It is however also true that over the past 15 years, there has been a new form of supply distribution channel that has emerged and that comes in the form of e-commerce. In spite of that supply and that opportunity for distribution in commerce to take place away from our great retail centers, over the past 15 years, we have generated ever-increasing rents, ever-increasing sales productivity and maintained very high occupancies, all while enhancing the merchandise mix and the attractiveness of our properties. So on the supply side, it\u2019s constrained from a brick-and-mortar viewpoint and even with the emergence of the e-commerce channel, our properties have performed very well, because they are in the last mile in the middle of great markets.","Now, let\u2019s look at the demand side and really again, rents are a function and occupancies are a function of supply and demand. It\u2019s true that we are in a season of restructurings of some of the legacy retail brands and the demise of some of these retail brands. This is normal. This happens and has happened in the history of retail for hundreds, if not 2,000 years. Why have these brands had to restructure or why have they faded away? In some cases, it was too much debt. In some cases, it was a failure for them to become omni-channel. In other cases, it was simply boredom with the shopper, who no longer felt that the brand stand \u2013 stood for anything and that again is normal. It doesn\u2019t take e-commerce to kill these brands. Let\u2019s not forget that brands such as Montgomery Ward, Woolworths and you know all of the names, they all died in the past because of boredom and that was well before the years of e-commerce, as you look at it.","In terms of where is demand coming for our properties going forward? There is obviously food that is an ongoing and terrific addition to our centers, experiential retail that is coming to our centers and that we will be adding dramatically to our centers. The real source of demand going forward for us is going to come from vertically integrated digitally born brands. The same e-commerce channel that many are afraid is going to kill brick-and-mortar today, is currently incubating and creating the great brands of tomorrow. Brands like UNTUCKit, Ministry of Supply, b8ta, INDOCHINO, Athleta, Blue Nile, Bonobos, Warby Parker, Monica + Andy, Interior Define, Allbirds, Madison Reed the list goes on and on.","The digital commerce, while it has hastened in some degrees, the demise of irrelevant brands that have lost their way with the shopper, is most importantly incubating the creation of new businesses. The cloud, if you will, is making the birth of new brands far more efficient than the old model where people had to create an idea and then go out and take the risk of testing that idea with a series of brick-and-mortar. While we are on a sea of tough headlines, our view of the future for our great gathering places located in the last mile in dense demographic markets is very bright.","Digital commerce is not a threat to our model. It is a great friend to our model. And again, as I indicated, while it may hasten the demise of boring retailers, that is far overpowered by the creation of new brands of vertically integrated digitally-born brands. These are brands that create a sense of community and loyalty in the digital world, before they decide to open their first store and when they do begin to round out their omni-channel strategy, they\u2019re able to attract shoppers that are already following their brand and that come and visit their brand with a sense of purpose and intent.","With that, I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Great. Good afternoon and good morning to you. I guess, just focusing on Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, I guess, it opens next year, 2018. I just wonder, how will that rollout will it have the grand opening where everything opens or is there going to be opening gradually throughout 2018?","Art Coppola","We haven\u2019t announced the hard opening date. That\u2019s really more of a placeholder at this point in time. Usually with the opening of any center, in terms of the local markets, that\u2019s done generally about 6 months before the hard opening date. So that\u2019s to be determined at this point in time, Craig.","Craig Schmidt","And would you say just given some of your comments that the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia will have obviously a food component, but also a strong experiential component?","Art Coppola","It will, yes.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, great. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Hey, Art.","Art Coppola","Your voice has dropped, Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, thank you. I can channel Christy, if you would like. So I had a question about Ontario Teachers, just from the standpoint of \u2013 I assume as a board member and your largest shareholder, have been very supportive of your actions to do share repurchase. Last summer, last August, you gave them the waiver to go up 20%. They are basically at 15% at the time, I think in part driven by the desire as you were buying back shares to allow them to move up gradually. But also you had expressed at the time that they themselves had expressed the desire to accumulate more stock, given where they had been buying it previously. But since then, they haven\u2019t bought any shares, the last \u2013 they did the big $500 million purchase in May \u201815 at a price of like $78 adjusted for the few specials, but nothing since. And so maybe you can just take us \u2013 and they are big owners in Canada of retail, so they understand the retail environment. So we are just trying to keep together why haven\u2019t they taken advantage of the market like you have to go up to the right that you gave them to, up to 20%?","Art Coppola","Well, to some degree, as the company is buying back shares obviously they are indirectly taking advantage of that also in terms of their own ownership increasing. Look, I can\u2019t speak for them. I am not going to speak for them. They are a big believer in the company, a big supporter of the company. By coincidence, we are actually in Toronto today. We move our board meetings around and periodically, we have one here and we will be seeing those folks later on today and tomorrow at our board meetings. They are a big supporter of the company, big believer in the strategy. What they do or don\u2019t do in the open markets, I don\u2019t think reflects anything around their sentiment.","Michael Bilerman","But are they precluded at all from having bought any shares, just for your largest shareholder to have so much knowledge and where the value of the shares are today, almost 20% below where they originally weighted average bought their stock, it\u2019s just something is missing from that equation, especially because when you talked about the waiver last summer, you said in part it was driven by their desire to want to move up similar to the year prior?","Art Coppola","Well, again, I think we can look at the glass being half-empty or half-full. I would say the other flipside of that is that throughout all of this, they have maintained their ownership in the company and have decided not to sell any shares, because they believe in its future. And I don\u2019t want to be argumentative with you, Michael, but I also don\u2019t want to speak for somebody that I can\u2019t speak for.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning up there. So, my question is you guys had spoken previously about funding stock buybacks with dispositions. I didn\u2019t see any dispos this quarter, so sort of a two-part, is one, what you guys have the guidance for stock buybacks and two, Art, what the appetite is out there today for B malls, where cap rates are and what you think transaction market could be for selling assets and if that will be used going forward to fund buybacks versus using refinancing proceeds?","Art Coppola","Well, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t see us funding buybacks with debt, period. And the buybacks \u2013 generally, we have said that for this tranche of the $500 million authorization, we anticipate that, that will be match-funded, not perfectly, but you know, over a short period of \u2013 window of time through these dispositions of non-core assets. Now, we did sell two non-core assets earlier this year that generated roughly the proceeds that were used for the purchase of shares. I do anticipate other non-core assets maybe sold over the course of this year and into next year. The buyer \u2013 there was news in the Chicago Press that we may have been selling an office building that we own there that\u2019s contiguous to North Bridge mall. We choose not to comment on acquisitions or dispositions until they are closed, but given that the buyer went out and leaked that information, I guess, I will confirm that we are under contract to sell along the 500 North Michigan and that again, would be something that could be used to fund stock buybacks. We are not currently entertaining the idea of selling what you would call B malls. We do have non-core assets, whether they be land or other types of assets, community centers that we will go to use to fund stock buybacks and that\u2019s what we really see as the source going forward.","Alexander Goldfarb","But Art, is the lack of B mall sales, is that because that market has changed from where it was maybe 6 months ago?","Art Coppola","I am not even paying attention to it. That\u2019s why.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan","Thank you. Two questions. First of all, Tom, you had talked about the financing plans for the balance of the year. I wonder if you could just kind of update us. I think you characterized the market as good, but if you could talk a little bit about loan-to-value ratios, whether they are continuing to be stable to what they have been in the past and whether all of this public negative narrative is having any impact on how lenders approach the market?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Jim, a lot of what we have done and will do in the second half of the year is life company financing. Their underwriting has typically been fairly conservative, but I haven\u2019t really seen that change dramatically. They realized the quality of the tenants and the quality of the real estate in A quality malls and they have for many years. So, they continue to be very focused on getting transactions done on A quality regional malls. So, we expect that to continue. The spreads have not widened. I mean, we are still looking at quotes for 10-year deals under 4%. And typically, our borrowing level is 50% to 60% loan-to-value and we have not seen that change. We haven\u2019t seen any restrictions push down its limits on the amount of proceeds, because that\u2019s how we really target anyway and we are going to continue to stay in that range. And there may or may not be a strong market in CMBS, but we do typically get quotes on everything we do there and the market does seem to be there as well for A quality regional malls.","Art Coppola","And I would just add to that, Jim. Look, the life companies have been students of this business for a long period of time, and for the 40 some years that I have been doing this and they have revered and held great regional malls as being one of the top two asset classes that they want to invest their debt capital in to fund their businesses and their obligations. And that has not changed and I don\u2019t know if we have mentioned it, but we have one property that \u2013 a good mall, solid citizen for us that when we recently exposed it to the debt markets, a couple of life companies stepped up and offered us debt at a level in excess of $400 million. What we will actually take in proceeds will be determined by being somewhat rate sensitive also. So, these are big checks and bit votes of confidence from people that don\u2019t have an equity upside and have all the downside if you think about that they are worried about the business model and they are sitting there very comfortable writing very large checks that are supported by the assets that are in the heart of this portfolio.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, thanks for that. Second question for me regarding Scottsdale Fashion Square, I believe you are in the process of trying to get permission for kind of the second phase of an expansion, densification of that site and I believe that included a building height of up to 150 feet. I wonder if you could share with us what alternatives you are thinking about here for Phase 2?","Art Coppola","Well, I think one of our core competencies, Jim, is getting entitlements in communities and given that we are usually the largest and most important taxpayer in business in every one of the communities that we do business in, we have really good relationships with local governments. And when we look at the \u2013 we have excess land around a 2 million square foot retail center, we come to the conclusion that, look, we have enough retail and when we have had the opportunity to add more retail there, it tends to be more experiential. So, when we recently expanded Scottsdale, we added a big theater complex as well as a big sporting goods and then we still have a ton of vacant land that we have recycled and recaptured. It is now no longer contiguous to just the typical suburban mall, it is contiguous to what has become the urban core frankly of the entire state of Arizona. So, the demand for density, either from residential, hotel, or office, each of which we think enhances a sense of place around our retail centers, similar to what we did at Tysons Corner, is very high. So, the first step is simply to get your entitlements and the fact that we have asked for that level of entitlement I think reflects the fact that there is demand to fill a building that would occupy that size. After we get the entitlement, then we will go ahead and proceed and put further color and definition over what the uses will be. So, that\u2019s pretty much where we are at. It\u2019s a great location and one of the attributes of these centers is, especially as time has gone on, is that the opportunity to densify them is there, there is great value to be achieved from that and we have had a great experience in seeing that happen at other properties.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, good. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi.","Art Coppola","Hey, Mike.","Michael Mueller","I was wondering, are you expecting any material impact on Danbury from the Norwalk development or are you thinking it\u2019s just too far away?","Art Coppola","I am not going to comment on that. We are getting strong retailer demand at the same time that they are likely doing their leasing. So the retailers are voting with their signatures that they want to be at Danbury. We have a significant number of additional uses and retailers \u2013 all retail uses, I guess, I would say that we are talking to about adding them to Danbury. So look, Danbury is a great center. It puts up great rents, it puts up great sales productivity. And anytime you have new supply come in to a market, you\u2019re going to have some that impact. I think the people that study where the sales will come from and talking to the department stores that are going to go there and you think about where the transfer is going to come from, while Danbury undoubtedly, will feel some of that, I think there are certain other centers that are not owned by us that might feel more of it and certain other markets that might feel more of it.","Michael Mueller","Okay. And then looking at the redevelopment page, what are the triggers that you are looking for to move forward with something in Paradise Valley and Westside?","Art Coppola","Each of them, I think are going to be triggered by recapturing a department store location and once that\u2019s done at each of them, you can kind of kick into the next gear. So we will be reporting on that. And look, we are not in the mood to overpay for the department store locations say a Paradise Valley, for example. In the meantime, we are essentially land banking the property. It\u2019s generating cash and \u2013 but at this point in time, I would see each of them, frankly as non-core retail assets, but both are great real estate in great markets.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take the next question from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Hey, Todd.","Art Coppola","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","Todd Thomas","Just a question on operations, I think there was an expectation that occupancy might have fallen in the quarter, it was actually up slightly sequentially and the company historically has taken a little bit of a harder stance in negotiations with retailers than many peers. Can you just speak to whether you are approaching discussions with retailers any differently than you have in the past, whether that strategy around balancing occupancy and rent has changed at all and just given the current environment?","Robert Perlmutter","Todd, this is Bob Perlmutter. I think our approach is really unchanged. Again, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we believe we are very high-quality centers. We believe in looking at the centers on a long-term basis, not on a short-term basis. We don\u2019t believe investing in retailers unless we think they will be successful long-term. So one of the comments that I noted is when you are looking at these occupancies, recognize that there is some store closures related to bankruptcies and terminations that are still going to hit in the latter half of the year, which will impact the occupancy. And the other point is that temporary occupancy went up slightly in the quarter as well. So part of that is a change of mix where, again we are not rushing to fill these in spaces unless we think we have the right tenant at the right economics.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Do you think you can sustain or grow occupancy into the second half of the year given those additional closures that you are anticipating or do you think you will take a step back and what about leasing spreads in the coming quarters?","Art Coppola","As we have said before, we think the leasing spreads have been pretty stable. And looking forward, we think they will remain stable. In terms of occupancy, my guidance is that the occupancies maybe flat or down slightly depending on the bankruptcy and closures.","Todd Thomas","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. Tom, just a question on the guidance, the 3% to 4% same-store, I am just curious it does seem like there is a headwind from a lease termination perspective given your updated guidance in sort of the first half, back half kind of numbers. I know not all of that flows through same-store, but I was just curious, what are the major offsets to that headwind other than obviously the leasing environment?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, we include lease term fees in our same-center, Vince, so I would call it a tailwind, not a headwind. We do think we are going to get some more of that flow through in the third and fourth quarters as evidenced by our increase in guidance. And that\u2019s just part of the process that we go through. It\u2019s not a terribly unusual year for us. 2016, we had $21 million of lease term fees. It fluctuates anywhere from $12 million to $22 million, $23 million, so we are kind of in the middle of that. And the one thing we do have \u2013 the second half of the year, we are not going up against these tougher comps as we were in the first half of the year. That being said, we do have some space to lease, there is a little bit of pressure on the occupancy level, but all those things kind of balance out to where we are today and not inconsistent with the guidance we gave in the beginning of the year.","Vincent Chao","And maybe I need to follow-up offline, I am just looking at the first half lease terminations, I think were $12 million, at least about $5 million in the back half. I think last year, you had about $12 million in the back half?","Tom O\u2019Hern","That\u2019s right, last year was more back end weighted, that\u2019s correct.","Vincent Chao","Right. So wouldn\u2019t that be a drag on same-store NOI this year in the back half?","Tom O\u2019Hern","On the second half, sure, but this is what helps accelerate us in the first half, but we are also going against weaker comps in the third and fourth quarter. We had a growth rate in the first quarter last year, 7.5%, we had a growth rate of 6.5% in the second and the growth rate slowed in the second half of 2016. So, we are going against easier comps.","Vincent Chao","Okay, okay. And just maybe a different topic, I thought I heard in the discussion around which formats are sort of growing and obviously apparel has been shrinking a little bit, theaters was I think in there up 17%, I don\u2019t want to over-read let\u2019s say any one data point, but AMC had a pretty weak quarter. I was just curious how you\u2019re feeling about theaters in general? If you\u2019re willing to invest in theaters at this point or is that something that\u2019s less desirable at this point?","Art Coppola","Look, adding great multiplex theaters to our properties, has been \u2013 has resulted in great results for us across the board. I don\u2019t regret adding a first-class multiplex to any one of the properties that we\u2019ve ever done it to. One of the things that\u2019s driving very dramatic growth at Cerritos in the sales productivity has to be the new multiplex that replaced the smaller format that we put into place, and we\u2019ve got demand from theaters at other locations when we recapture, either, say, Sears locations through our \u2013 where we have the rights to recapture, we have a number of those locations that have demand for theaters. Will we be prudent, in terms of how we make those theater deals and not invest too heavily in the building and maybe lean more heavily towards the idea of ground leases or modest \u2013 the lack of or modest investment. I\u2019d say, yes. But you know, we\u2019ve been very happy with the traffic that comes from theaters and what it does for the properties in some of our great centers. Now having said that there are other uses that also draw big traffic and we\u2019re currently in deep conversations around adding, in the beginning, two Lifetime Fitness Centers to our portfolio at 1 in Arizona, and 1 in the Bay Area. And the reason that we\u2019re attracted to that is first of all, don\u2019t get confused by the word fitness. When I say Lifetime Fitness, it\u2019s really a club and it\u2019s a club around health and beauty and it\u2019s a place to be. And it draws a great customer in terms of the demographic of the members that they bring, frankly, the disposable income of many of their members is actually higher than our shopping base and it brings an element of traffic to the property that could easily generate hundreds of new trips \u2013 hundreds of trips per day to our property. And generally, the nice thing is during hours that are not necessarily peak shopping hours, so it\u2019s a very complementary, and it\u2019s a traffic generator. So, look, I put theaters into the category of being a traffic generator, and they generate a lot of traffic and we get cross shopping that obviously enhances the food and other uses as a result of that. I would look at the addition of Lifetime to these first couple of properties and I believe others with us, to be in the same category. And there will be other categories that we will use to generate traffic. There are a number of new experiential type of retailers that want to be in our centers, including virtual and augmented reality retailers, or uses that would like to be in our centers. The great thing about them is they generate traffic. It\u2019s something you can\u2019t do at home. You have to come to the property, and you can only do it \u2013 and by doing it there, it\u2019s a better experience and people want it and it gives people a reason to gather and that\u2019s what we own, are gathering places.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, everyone. I will stick with that topic in the prepared remarks about the \u2013 seems like you are calling for the tenant base to turn a little bit as the new concepts come in, I am wondering if you had a time horizon on when everything will be back to normal levels as far as tenant turnover?","Art Coppola","No. But I do have a baseball analogy for you. Late innings through the ideas that are dead and no longer of interest, it is the top of the first inning for the vertically integrated digitally born brands that are in our \u2013 that are coming to our centers but more importantly, that are going to come to our centers. It\u2019s a new world and the new world is so much more efficient than the old world. It\u2019s like when the cloud came into being and it made it easier for technology and other businesses to be able to form, because they didn\u2019t have to all build their own infrastructure. Well the cloud, which really enables e-commerce, creates a breeding ground for brands. And again, I want to emphasize the word brand. Look, retailers that are resellers of other people\u2019s merchandise tend to be at risk from commodity pricing that can occur at, let\u2019s say, Amazon or Walmart, but brands that stand for their own and brands that create their own sense of social community and loyalty and, in some cases, subscription. Those create a following that when they open a store and trust me, every one of them intends to open brick-and-mortar locations because every one of them knows what that does in terms of enhancing the overall experience. And they know that their shopper \u2013 consumer wants it. When that happens, it brings shoppers that come with intent. So it\u2019s not like the old days when a store or somebody would dream up a new retail idea and then go roll it out and hope the people came. These are brands that have already got a proven sense of loyalty and community around them so that when they open, it\u2019s a pretty sure thing that they\u2019re going to be very successful, they\u2019re going to drive traffic and that it\u2019s going to enhance their overall omni-channel strategy. So we\u2019re on top of the first inning of the new brands coming to these retail locations. And when they come to brick-and-mortar, when you talk to them, and I spent a lot of time with them, in the beginning, I said \u2013 I wondered how they would react about saying I\u2019d like you to come and be in our mall. And I didn\u2019t get any resistance. And for those that would say, I don\u2019t want to be in a mall. Then the next question I would ask is I\u2019ll say, alright, fine. Do you want to be in this city? Yes, okay. Now do you want to be the best location in the city by a landlord that will support your business with parking, clean common areas, control the co-tenancy around you and market your business along with the others, would you like to be in that environment instead of a standalone facility with no support from anybody? And again, the answer is yes. So we are in the early days, but as this hand plays out, I am absolutely certain that it will create the next generation of great retailers and most importantly, it is a far more efficient way for retailers to be born.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And real quick on the omni-channel, do you see more of these omni-channel retailers offering goods cheaper if you pick up in store, I mean obviously sell some of the last mile distribution, but also you get that incremental spend. I am just curious why more people do not offer discounts when you pick up in the store?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t have an answer for you on that, I am sorry.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","Yes, good morning out there. So, a few for you here, Art. First, I guess, can you talk about the decision to switch the focus of Fashion Outlets in Philly to more of a full-priced focus versus prior plans that were a bit more outlet in nature? And can you talk a bit about any expected impact perhaps on returns?","Art Coppola","What was the second half of that question?","Haendel St. Juste","Returns. Any impact on the returns?","Art Coppola","Any impact on our returns, the return, rate of return. I am sorry, I was having trouble hearing what you said. It\u2019s simply a question of demand. We unexpectedly \u2013 as we are marketing it to the outlet community, found traditional retailers say, wait a minute, I want to be there too. And it\u2019s just a function of demand. And they were willing to step up and pay the appropriate rent and it\u2019s a quality problem. There are some of these retailers, frankly, that are saying to us, we think this is the wave of the future because you\u2019re going to have a mix of some full priced, some outlets, some entertainment, some experiential, who knows. But the quality side of the answer \u2013 of the problem would also be that the full-priced tenants that are going to be put in there, which is unusual, is just a function of demand and they are pushing aside the other uses for being there by stepping up to the plate and paying more and offering to put in great locations, which is what we want.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Alright. I also noticed you were pushing back expected delivery of your Fashion Outlets in San Francisco back 2 years? Curious what\u2019s causing the delay? Is it market project specific or maybe is there anything to read into perhaps how you are thinking about outlet developments?","Art Coppola","No, no, no, we covered this on the last call which maybe \u2013 you weren\u2019t a part of. And we explained in great detail what was going on there, but it\u2019s simply a function that we are part of a master plan community and have a partner that is the master planner and \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual when you are master planning hundreds and hundreds of acres in the heart of San Francisco that things could get pushed aside and infrastructure delivery and things like that.","Haendel St. Juste","That\u2019s right. Alright. So, one last one, if I may. One of your non-mall retail peers this morning announced a JV with a platform with extensive ties to the Latino community to focus on that underserved community. So I was curious given your portfolio footprint having a lot of West and Southwest is that something you have actively considered or are actively considering?","Art Coppola","We are very sophisticated in our knowledge of trading in Latino markets. I think having a strategy of focusing on properties that are located within Latino markets is a brilliant strategy. We actually had a program a number of years ago with its own marketing team and its own management team and its own leasing team that was called Vanguardia that was focused primarily on that, and it resulted in very good operating results. But right or wrong, while we were generating nice cash returns for whatever reason, the sales productivity, including the fact that there are certain cash transactions involved in those centers also, that we were reporting, didn\u2019t really \u2013 was not being appreciated enough by the Street. So we thought about enhancing our presence in that business line and just rightly or wrongly decided against it and actually started exiting some of those properties. So, Panorama Mall, for example, that we sold was in a very dense Hispanic Latino market. I think that\u2019s a great strategy. Look, it\u2019s the first or second largest demographic that\u2019s growing in the United States. It\u2019s a great shopper and I applaud the strategy. It\u2019s just \u2013 we did it and we\u2019ve had some very good success with it and we know how to market to that ethnic base and we\u2019ve done very well with it, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s not our core business, we said look, is that our core business or is Tyson, the Queen\u2019s, Brooklyn, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Santa Monica Place, or is that our core business? And that\u2019s where we focused.","Haendel St. Juste","Alright.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning, guys. First question, just digging into the numbers a little bit, I see other rental income looked like it declined to $12.984 million in 2Q from $13.873 million at the prior quarter, that\u2019s despite lease termination fees increasing pretty significantly as you noted. So maybe you can give some color as to what declined over the quarter to offset that lease termination income?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. Rich, lease term revenue is not in other income, it\u2019s in rental income. So it\u2019s not in there. Other income is things like advertising income, sponsorship income, parking income, things like that. So, it\u2019s a relatively minor decline in that category can be lumpy, but lease term revenue is in rental income.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick [indiscernible] with UBS.","Greg McGinniss","Hi. This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. So curious about your tenant watch list, how has that changed since the beginning the year and what\u2019s your expectation in 2018?","Robert Perlmutter","This is Bob Perlmutter. Obviously, a number of the bankruptcies that occurred in \u201817 were on that watch list. The watch list is clearly at a higher than it\u2019s been than it\u2019s been 3 or 4 or 5 years ago. So there\u2019s still a number of people on the watch list \u2013 it\u2019s still fundamentally the same reasons they\u2019re on the watch list whether it\u2019s poor financial and capital structure, whether it\u2019s, as Art mentioned, boring concepts that aren\u2019t keeping up with their competitors. What we\u2019re finding is in the most recent set of bankruptcies that occurred in the second quarter, most are being restructured, so they\u2019re getting their capital structure right, which is good, which lessens the impact. So we still feel like there\u2019s a lot out there. We don\u2019t necessarily feel that it\u2019s growing but we don\u2019t necessarily feel that it\u2019s going away. And I think over the next 6 to 12 months, we\u2019ll have more clarity on that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning out there. Any update in regards to the Seritage JV?","Art Coppola","No, we are working with our partner in terms of figuring out do we want to recapture part of the amount that we have the ability to recapture or do we want to wait to recapture the whole thing, we have got a number of development plans that were working closely with Seritage on, and we\u2019ve got some pretty exciting ideas. But as we focus on a specific plan, and we like the plan and we have made the appropriate arrangement to recapture with Sears, then they\u2019ll be announced, just like any other project but the partnership with Seritage is a hand-in-glove planning exercise. And you know, look, I\u2019ve view this type of situation as I\u2019m getting paid to dream. I\u2019m getting paid rent right now while we\u2019re coming up with great ideas to make money off of those boxes and that acreage and to also enhance the property to which they are attached.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. I would like to turn the conference back over to Art Coppola for any additional or closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Thank you very much everyone and we look forward to seeing you in the weeks and months to come and reporting to you through the balance of this year. Enjoy the balance of your summer. Thank you.","Operator","And once again, that concludes today\u2019s call.

I would like to remind you that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations.

During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Consistent with past practice, we are going to be limiting this call to one hour. If we happen to run out of time and you still have questions, please don't hesitate to give me or call or John or Jean.","The third quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolios' key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $1.04 per share, up from $1.01 in the third quarter of last year. Same-center NOI increased by 4.2% compared to the third quarter of 2015 which was a very tough comp quarter that was up 7%. This was positively impacted by $7.8 million of lease termination revenues in the third quarter. So in most cases, we were accelerating revenue we would have received in the fourth quarter and beyond into the third quarter.","Year to date, our same-center NOI growth is 6% and as we discussed on our last earnings call, most of the impact of the major tenant bankruptcies this year will be felt in the third and fourth quarter, which means lower same-center NOI growth in the third and fourth quarter than we saw in the first half of the year. Our same-center estimate for NOI for the year, the range is being tightened to 4.5% to 4.75%.","As we look forward into 2017, we are not giving full guidance for the year, but we are going to give some guidance on our expectation for same-center NOI growth. It will be down slightly from this year and we expect a range of 3% to 4% same-center growth in 2017. Keep in mind that for the first half of 2016, we had the comparative benefit of the expense cuts that were initiated in the third quarter of 2015. We will not have that comparative benefit as we compare 2017 to 2016.","Our gross operating margin on a same-center basis for the quarter improved to 69.6%. That was up from 68.5% in the third quarter of 2015 and if we compare it to the third quarter of 2014 two years ago, it's a 399 basis point improvement. Year to date, the same-center gross margin was 69.33%, up from 67.9% during the same period of last year.","Bad debt expense was a modest $300,000 for the quarter, down compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of last year. As I mentioned previously, lease termination fees were $7.8 million for the quarter. That compared with $3.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of these termination fees came from Sears at Kings Plaza where we exercised our right to terminate their lease early. This had the effect of accelerating about $2.5 million of rent that would have been paid in the fourth quarter into the third.","During the third quarter, the average interest rate was 3.48%, up slightly from a year ago when it was 3.3%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics were healthy with debt to market cap at 37%, an interest coverage ratio of over 3.5 times, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2 and the average debt maturity after the financing of Fresno Fashion Fair, which happened on October 6, is now over 6.5 years.","The financing market for high quality regional malls remains good. A couple of examples. On October 6, we closed a $325 million loan on the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. It was a CMBS loan, the first one we have done in a while, a 10-year fixed rate loan with an interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from that financing were used to pay down our line of credit which, subsequent to that pay down, is approximately $750 million outstanding.","Also on August 5, we closed on a $225 million loan on the Village at Corte Madera. That was a life insurance company loan. The term was 12-years and had a fixed interest rate of 3.5%.","I am sure you saw in this morning's press release that we tightened our previous estimate of diluted FFO per share. We narrowed the range to $4.05 to $4.10. That was down from $4.05 to $4.15. The revised FFO guidance comes primarily from reducing the midpoint of the range for the year on same-center NOI to 4.50% to 4.75%. That is down from our original guidance range of 4.50% to 5%.","The dilution from the sale of Capitola Mall, which was not included in the initial guidance, is offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt on Flagstaff, which also is not in the original guidance.","And now I would like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks Tom. Leasing activity during the third quarter was consistent with the first half of the year, producing strong re-leasing spreads and stable occupancies. Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 16.1%. This is unchanged from the second quarter. Leasing spreads were relatively consistent through all of the regions. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $56.52.","During the third quarter, a total of 803,000 square feet of leases were signed, down slightly from the previous quarter. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter increased to seven years.","Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.3%. This represents a 30 basis point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot and on a same-center basis sales were up 1.3% year over year.","I am going to talk a minute about development. The third quarter represented an important milestone for the company, as the developments at Broadway Plaza and Green Acres Commons celebrated their official grand openings. These two projects are illustrative of the company's strong development skills, taking unique retail locations and expanding their market dominance through densification. Combined, these two developments represented an investment of $263 million and will produce a blended stabilized return over 9%.","Over ten years in the making, the expansion of Broadway Plaza began in 2012 when Neiman Marcus joined existing anchors, Nordstrom and Macy's at the center. We are extremely pleased with the merchandise mix created at Broadway Plaza and more importantly, the initial sales results from the tenants. The new space is 94% leased and we anticipate all of the retailers will be open by this holiday season.","Green Acres Commons celebrated its grand opening on October 6. This two-level power center anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods is a strong addition to the Green Acres retail campus and provides a home for many big box retailers looking to tap this attractive New York market.","There were also a number of important anchor openings in the portfolio. These serve to further increase the draw from these established retail centers. At Fashion Outlets at Chicago, Nordstrom Rack opened its store on September 30. The center is now only one of two outlet venues in the U.S. that feature Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off 5th, Neiman's Last Call, Bloomingdale's Outlet and Barneys as its anchors.","Dick's Sporting Goods opened a new store at The Oaks on October 11. In addition, three restaurants were added adjacent to Dick's. And finally, J. C. Penney had a very strong grand opening at Inland Center on October 21. The reception from the community was outstanding.","I am going to take a minute to talk about tenant bankruptcies. There has been significant attention surrounding the health of certain specialty store tenants. You will recall, we entered 2016 cautious in our expectations regarding tenant bankruptcy. During the third quarter, the three most prominent bankruptcies of 2016 were resolved, albeit in very different fashions.","First, the bankruptcy of Sports Authority resulted in the liquidation of the entire chain. Almost all the stores were closed, except for a small number of leases purchased by other retailers. Second, PacSun completed their restructuring with a major creditor maintaining control of the company. PacSun emerged from bankruptcy in September with a restructured balance sheet and most of its store fleet intact. Finally, Aeropostale will emerge under the control of a consortium of buyers. It is anticipated that up to 500 stores will be retained.","Most of the economic impact from these bankruptcies will be felt during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. As Art has discussed in the past, throughout the portfolio, our focus is to reduce the exposure to weaker, lower productivity tenants well before they enter the restructuring process.","For example, in 2012, Aeropostale had 45 stores in our portfolio. When they entered bankruptcy, this number had been reduced to 27. This was achieved through the disposition of lower productivity centers, replacement at lease expiration with more productive tenants and early termination when the tenants still had the financial resources to pay termination fees. We expect our exposure with Aeropostale at the end of 2016 to be 19 store locations or approximately 78,000 square feet.","Looking forward, our leasing focus in the coming year will be to repurpose under-productive anchor department stores and replace the vacancy caused by recent tenant bankruptcies and early termination agreements. We believe opportunity exists in the anchor buildings by tapping demand from the big box and large formatted specialty retailers. As discussed on the last earnings call, the opportunity to re-tenant the Sears box at Kings Plaza with retailers that include Primark and Zara represents a unique opportunity to move the center to the next level in terms of traffic, sales productivity and merchandise mix.","And with that, I will turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you Bob and thank you Tom. Welcome to our call. As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter. Our leasing spreads remained extremely strong, consistent with our belief that we have embedded growth within our portfolio.","We have culminated an 18-month period of improving operating margins and achieved our goal of improving our operating margins by 400 basis points. And as Bob pointed out, during the quarter we successfully completed on time, on budget and at the returns that were expected, the Green Acres expansion and the Broadway Plaza expansion.","The Broadway Plaza expansion is an important one to contemplate. Broadway Plaza recently celebrated its 75th year in business. 75 years. We bought Broadway Plaza about 31 years ago and at the time it had an NOI of $3 million. Upon stabilization, we anticipate that NOI to be roughly $40 million. So this is testimony that great real estate in the hands of a great management with a well-capitalized balance sheet can succeed in spite of any challenges to the retail environment and any changes to the retail environment.","Our future we see to be very strong and bright. I am pleased however in the context of concerns over the retail environment, that at this point in time with the completion of the Green Acres and the Broadway Plaza expansion, we have modest exposure in terms of our capital spend to a possible weak retail environment going forward over the near term. We only have Philadelphia and Kings Plaza in process and both of those are proceeding as planned in terms of the merchandising and the leasing.","Having said all of that, we feel the pain of our investors and those of you on this call that follow our company and our industry. Back on August 1, only a little less than three months ago, Macerich was trading at $91 a share and the RMZ was at 1,280. Today we are roughly at $72 a share, the RMZ is down to 1,105. Malls as a sector are obviously down 500 to 600 basis points more than the other sectors that comprise the RMZ.","Is it fundamentals about the mall business that has caused us to under-perform? I would say, from the viewpoint of our management, that we see our fundamentals to be at least as strong today as they were three months ago, six months ago, nine months ago. But it is hard to ignore the difference in terms of the performance of the sector.","If we are going to look at what event happened during the last three months that potentially led to and has led to this underperformance, it's hard to ignore the August 11 announcement by Macy's that they were closing 100 department stores. Many of our investors have expressed concern over this. I want to share with you our view about those store closures.","First of all, it is healthy for any retailer to prudently prune their portfolio and to weed out unproductive business units and to focus their attention on their more productive business units. That's what we do as a company. Closing stores is a prudent thing and a stronger Macy's makes for a stronger mall base. As I look at our exposure to Macy's and to these closures, it's our understanding that when those closures are announced, that we will have one store in our portfolio at that point in time that will be on the closure list and we see the closure of that store to be a positive, not a negative. It's most likely going to be a West L.A. store and it's a situation that is ready for redevelopment, as we have discussed in previous calls.","As I think further about department stores and I think bout the anxiety that people have about department stores, I also think about what has happened over the past 10 or 12 years with department stores. And one of the seminal events that happened in the department store industry was in 2005, when Macy's bought May Company and that caused a significant consolidation within the department store business. The combination of that event and the general underperformance of department stores over the last 10 or 12 years has actually been arguably a positive for mall-goers.","I know that seems strange for me to say that, but let me share with you the reason why. With the consolidation of Macy's and May Company going back 11 years ago, many of the brands that really make up the excitement within a department store began to look at the balance of power that they had in their negotiations with department stores and decided that they wanted to add another channel of distribution to their omnichannel approach and albeit 11 years ago, I doubt that word was really used that much. But many of the great brands had relied predominantly on their distribution to be wholesale distribution through the department stores.","And over a period of time, those brands have decided to open up full-priced retail stores and in many cases flagship stores and they comprise many of the best names that we have in the mall today. Names like Kiehl's, Michael Kors, Eileen Fisher, Hugo Boss, Diane von Furstenberg, AllSaints, Louis Vuitton, Tory Burch, Ted Baker, Armani, MAC Cosmetics, Burberry, True Religion, the list goes on. And we see that trend continuing, which is a trend that, as I have mentioned in the past, is a trend that you see generally in place in the global portfolios of other owners of shopping centers around the world.","So we see the store closures of Macy's to be a positive, not a negative. We see its impact on Macerich to be a positive, not a negative. And as I look at the overall health of the department store business, let's not lose sight of the fact that it was only three years ago that many folks that probably are on this call right now felt that J. C. Penney was doomed in terms of their future. And at that point in time, we were a bit of an outlier, where we said look, one name that we see out there that we think is going to be in existence as a retailer five or 10 years after 2013 is going to be J. C. Penney and there's been much written about their turnaround. I can tell you that J. C. Penney stores look better than ever and we are very happy with the new Penney's store that we just opened at Inland Center. Again, I feel your pain, I understand it, but the fundamentals that we have here remain very strong.","With that I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Christine McElroy with Citi.","Christine McElroy","Hi. Good morning to you.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Christine.","Christine McElroy","Okay. So Bob, just following up on your releasing spreads, which had been pretty consistent in the last few quarters, around that 14% to 16% level and we know that doesn't include the rent adjustments. But just looking at your average base rents, your ABR growth is pretty flattish over the last year. So realizing that those may be two different pools, but just wondering why with that strength in spreads, you are not seeing more flow through into ABR? Has that been impacted by the rent relief at all? And with your comment that the biggest impact from the three bankruptcies should be in Q4 and 2017, how should we think about that trend in ABR over the next two quarters?","Robert Perlmutter","Christine, it has been flat over sort of, if you look at the 2015 compared to the first three quarters of 2016, it is somewhat two separate pools. So we have to be careful about that. But where I think as a general rule, we continued to see strong growth in the more dominant centers, we continue to see moderate to weaker growth in the lesser productivity centers.","And in terms of the impact of the lease amendments, we did run those numbers and the impact is not really material in our numbers. And what you need to remember is, within the pool of these restructurings, some of the stores are closed which obviously don't affect the spreads. Some of the stores are assumed, which don't affect the spreads. So if you do look at your lease amendments, it's only the ones which are modifying the lease, which tend to be some percentage of the total leases, but not 100%.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then just Art, just a follow-up on your comments. Do you think that these bankruptcies and the granting of rent relief and all this negative rhetoric around it could potentially translate into tougher lease negotiations in terms of normal course leasing, just from the perception that it creates?","Art Coppola","No. Demand remains very strong from a growing list of retailers. It's part of the process every year and always has been. So no, I don't see it as having a secular impact on our position of strength in terms of lease negotiations.","Christine McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Yes. I just wanted to go back to the Aero commentary. It sounds like 19 stores, so about eight of them going away. Is that the total number? Or is there still some potential for that to change from here?","Robert Perlmutter","There's always the potential for change, but that's our best estimate right now. Those deals have been agreed to, but are not yet documented. So that's in process. Just to understand, part of the thinking on this process is, we look at what's in the long term best interest of these centers and we believe very strongly in our real estate and we don't necessarily solely focus on the short-term impact, if we think that it's the right long term decision.","Vincent Chao","Yes. Okay. And then just I guess with the stores themselves, I thought most of them were undergoing liquidation sales. I guess, is that not the case at this point?","Robert Perlmutter","No. I think you are correct. The liquidators are part of the consortium that buys it and they have them through the end of the year and then Aeropostale will take them over.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then I guess maybe any update, I guess there's is some talk of project out in Carson, California, potentially an outlet project. Any update on that front?","Art Coppola","Not since our last call. We have an agreement with the city there and we are proceeding under the terms of that agreement. When we have more to announce, we will.","Vincent Chao","Okay. I think that's it for me. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Hi. Thanks. Just first question for Bob. You noted your rather cautious view heading into 2016 and I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you feel late in the year here as we head into 2017 about the leasing environment and additional store closures or bankruptcies in the year ahead?","Robert Perlmutter","Well, as Art mentioned, I mean our viewpoint through the entire year has been relatively consistent. We do feel like many of the circumstances that caused some of these bankruptcies are still present. We don't think it's gotten necessarily worse. We don't think it's gotten materially better. So we continue to be cautious. We continue to try to be realistic and we continue to try to make the right decisions long term for these properties.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then a question maybe Art or Bob also. I was just wondering if you have a view over how the Aero process ultimately played out with the consortium that stepped in and what you are seeing with that process so far? And do you think we could see more of that going forward with other troubled retailers? And would Macerich look to potentially get involved?","Art Coppola","Well, I am not going to comment on the future, but as it relates to the process I think that I am positive on the fact that Aero has a chance to potentially live another day. They had plenty of stores that were performing very well and we will see.","Todd Thomas","Okay.","Art Coppola","So I guess I will indirectly say thank you to my friends at General Growth and Simon for being instrumental in that.","Todd Thomas","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hi guys. In terms of the margin improvements, you are about a year in, I think and a significant portion of the expense efficiencies are pretty well baked to this point. So can you just talk a little bit more about the revenue side? Where you are at today pushing some of those revenue enhancements? And how much more runway is there? Are we talking about maybe another 100 basis points of margin expansion in that 3% to 4% in 2017 same-store expectation?","Art Coppola","Sure, I am happy to take ownership of that. Look, without a lot of time to really calculate how much margin improvement we thought that we could obtain, we put out a goal of 400 basis points over a two-year period. We announced that about 18 months ago and we have achieved that in less than the two years. I don't think there's greater or that there's significantly more room for margin improvement on the expense side, but we remain diligent about expenses at all times. I do believe that there is continued improvement on the revenue side but I am not going to put a target out there that we will be held accountable for other than a promise that we will report to you as time goes on and my suspicion is that there's upside in that number.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. I appreciate that.","Art Coppola","And that's certainly our goal and we have plans and we know how we are going to get there but we will report that one as we go along.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And then just as a follow-up, just given some of the pressures we are hearing on the higher end outlet space. Has this impacted any of your thinking on a fashion outlet to San Francisco at this point or still too early?","Art Coppola","No. It has not affected our thinking. But look, as I mentioned, there are anxieties out there in general, coming from many different arenas. It's hard to ignore the headwinds that come from all kinds of different places, whether it be the strong dollar, the tourism spending, reducing, whatever the anxieties are. And so as I mentioned in my comments, I think we are pleased to have a modest capital spend in place. We are in good shape at this point in time in terms of our marketing and leasing of the two projects that we are spending money on, Kings and Philadelphia. And we have the ability on anything else that we do in the future to time the shovel in the ground to signed leases.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Art Coppola","Hi Craig.","Craig Schmidt","Hi. Thanks. Nice to hear the good news, you are only having one Macy's close out of yours. However we are starting to look like the REITs in general will not have as many closings as other private malls. But what do you think might happen to some of those lower quality private malls as they lose the Macy's and their ability to remain viable?","Art Coppola","The good news is, I don't have to spend time thinking about that and I don't have an answer for you right off the top of my head. We made a decision. The flip side of that is that, look, it's not surprising that the public companies which tend to own the better properties have lesser exposure. It's not surprising that Macerich which has been extremely diligent in pruning our portfolio has even less exposure than you would expect. Look, we see it as healthy for Macy's.","Here is the flip side to all of that, also. If Macy's had ignored the idea of pruning the portfolio, I think the louder commentary should be, why aren't they closing stores? So here they come out and they decide to be prudent and smart in running their business. And all of a sudden, I understand it. Look, it came out of left field for a lot of people, everybody thought well, God, I thought Macy's was okay. But it's good for their business and what's good for them is good for us.","And whether it be Macy's or any other anchor that we have in the portfolio that we own, we see it as opportunities generally. We see the opportunities to replace them with other uses that draw traffic and that do the job of what an anchor is supposed to do. So from my viewpoint, I don't see it as a negative at all.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then just, has there been any forward progress in terms of Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia and some of the bigger space getting taken up?","Art Coppola","Yes. And announcements will be made as leases are signed and as we deem it appropriate in terms of the marketing of the property. But we just had an all-day session with our leasing team on that project yesterday and we are in good shape at this point in time.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Art Coppola","Hi Michael.","Michael Mueller","Hi. So Tom, the 3% to 4% same-store NOI for 2017, is that being impacted significantly at all by changes in lease term expectations, compared to what you are booking in 2016?","Tom O'Hern","Well, we haven't gotten down to that level of disclosure in the guidance, but at $19 million for 2016, that's extraordinarily high for us. We have been averaging $10 million to $12 million but it's always a tradeoff when you take that termination. For example, we made the decision to terminate Sears early, because you are foregoing future minimum rent and charges. But it is factored in too, I think in general, that we will not have lease term revenue that's as high as we get this year.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. And then looking at a couple of your top centers, so Queens Center sales the past couple of years have been about $1,100 a foot. This year it looks like they are over $1,300. And then Washington Square, where they were $1,100 a foot for the past couple years, it's down to about $1,000. I was wondering is anything specifically going on with those two centers or just a little bit of color?","Robert Perlmutter","Yes. This is Bob Perlmutter. The Queens had an Apple store that annualized and was brought into the pool. So that impacted the sales per square foot. And Washington Square is a no sales tax state. So we actually had the opposite in terms of some of the commercial sales being transferred out of the retail store into other venues.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hello. Good morning out there.","Art Coppola","Hi Alexander.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi. How are you? Maybe Tom, just some quick guidance questions and then I will go to maybe Bobby. But first, in the guidance some of the changes that we noted were the impact of asset sales from last year and earlier this year, now expect to be $80 million versus $75 million and then the debt gain impact also changed, it went from, I think, a negative down 2% to positive plus 4.5%. Can you just walk us through what happened from second quarter when you provided the guidance to now what changed in that?","Tom O'Hern","Yes. And you may have missed it, Alex. I think we already talked about this earlier in the call, but there's really two things. We sold Capitola, which happened in the second quarter. Obviously, we knew about that, but we were not about to knee-jerk react and change guidance just for that one item, because we were also in negotiations with a loan servicer on Flagstaff for that asset to go back. And we knew when that ultimately happened and title was transferred, we would recognize a gain and those two were roughly offsetting. So it certainly didn't warrant us changing guidance down for Capitola and then turning around in the next quarter and moving it up for Flagstaff. So those two netted out.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Then that's helpful. And then second is, on the street retail versus the malls, here in New York you obviously got Kings and Queens that would presumably compete with some of the street retail locations. And in Chicago you have 500 North Michigan, that's omni-avenue as well as has in-line. Have you noticed a change in the way that retailers, as you talk to them, as they are viewing their street retail presence versus the mall presence? My point is, do the retailers think of those in concert? Or do they think of each as different? And the street retail is a different leasing decision than the mall retail? Or within a certain metro or sub-market, they view it together and it's just basically where they think they can get more traffic?","Robert Perlmutter","Alex, it's Bob Perlmutter. I would say they really view it different. A couple of distinctions. Kings and Queens really don't compete with the street retail in Manhattan or New York. It's a more traditional mall mix and their strength really comes from the density of the population and the lack of alternatives for these retailers. North Bridge has a little bit of both. It has both the traditional mall space as well as some street space.","Generally, there's a pretty big distinction between what the retailer is trying to achieve on the street of these flagship locations or inside the mall. So they tend to be different decisions and often the real estate decision is controlled by different people within the retailer. So there's not really a situation where somebody says, the street market is getting soft. I am going to put more resources into the mall or vice versa. They are really, in our mind, two independent decisions.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","George Hoglund","Hi. This is George, on for Tayo. Just a question on Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. Are you running into any issues on the leasing front with radius restrictions?","Robert Perlmutter","I am sure that we run into those everywhere but nothing that is getting in the way of us delivering a very good project.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thanks. That was it.","Robert Perlmutter","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity.","Paul Morgan","Hi. Good morning.","Art Coppola","Hello.","Paul Morgan","Thanks for the color on the same-store next year. I am just trying to kind of triangulate the various numbers. So if I take where your guidance is now for this year, you did about 7% in the first half of the year and 4% this quarter, so that would put you, I guess, around 1% or so in the fourth quarter? And I know that some of that's due to lease term income, it sounds like. But if the back half is in a 2% to 3% range, it sounds like there's some movement higher as you look into next year. Is there anything I am getting wrong? Or if there is movement higher, what would that be due to?","Tom O'Hern","Well I think you have got a number of things impacting the fourth quarter. We accelerated some rents, Sears for example, at Kings Plaza and we pushed that into the third quarter when it normally would have been in the fourth, which was fairly sizeable. That was about $3 million in rent that got moved.","We also were going against very tough comps in the third and fourth quarter, because we had the benefit of the expense cuts in the third and fourth quarter on a comp basis last year compared to this year and that won't be recurring. So we see next year being a fairly normal year.","We are wrestling through the final aspects of some of the bankruptcies from this year, but really, our same-center growth is driven by rent increases which in general tend to be 2.5% to 3% in a given year and generally we look at these things on an occupancy neutral basis. And so I think fourth quarter was pretty unusual and we don't think it's indicative of what next year will be like and that's why we gave the guidance for next year.","Paul Morgan","I guess it's safe to say that you don't see anybody in terms of your watch list for first quarter or post holiday bankruptcies?","Tom O'Hern","I will defer to Bob on that.","Robert Perlmutter","In terms of specific names, no. But again, we do maintain a watch list and there are certain tenants that we are looking to reduce our exposure to.","Paul Morgan","Okay. Just last question on Macy's. That's good color there too. Macy's, in addition to culling the bottom of the portfolio mentioned that they might try to, like they did this year, take a couple of opportunistic closings at malls where there's a higher and better use. And I am just wondering in your portfolio, say you have got a handful of malls where there's more than one Macy's and stronger assets, is this something you would look to potentially recapture? Is your appetite for recapturing department store space changed at all now, given your view of the leasing environment? Or is that still something you would look to do?","Art Coppola","Thanks for the question. I do think that the one store closure that we are anticipating fits exactly into that category that there's a higher and better use and a user that's willing to pay them a compelling number to convert their store to a higher and better use and they have deemed it, they look at their overall representation and deemed that to be appropriate for them. And we see it as potentially an opportunity for us.","As we look at the rest of the stores that we have with Macy's, there are opportunities in certain locations to repurpose either some of their square footage, downsize them or maybe even completely replace them with a higher and better use. We are in conversations with them. This is going to be, I think, a longer conversation.","I wouldn't predict there will be any announcements from us on any time soon, but I would predict there will be announcements that would fit the category of converting some of their square footage in a location or all of their square footage in a location to a higher and better use. That should happen some time in the future.","I also would anticipate that there will be announcements in the future of where we and Macy's have worked together to just make the overall environment more profitable and that could involve something that could be a monetization for them too.","Paul Morgan","Great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Ronald Camden","Hi. Thank you. This is Ronald Camden on Richard Hill's line. Just two quick ones for me. The first is on the financing market. I know you guys got Fresno done in the CMBS side. Just maybe give us a little color what you are seeing out there and if Eastland is still a potential financing you are trying to get done for this year.","Tom O'Hern","Well, Eastland is an unencumbered asset and it's available for financing. We haven't started that process yet, but it's certainly possible. We had good experience at Fresno. We exposed that to the CMBS market. The pricing, as you probably heard at 3.59% for a 10-year deal, was fairly competitive. I would say, it would have been very competitive with a life company quote had we gone that route. And I don't know how deep the market is. We were just really are trying to finance that one particular asset, but I will tell you it was very competitive and there was probably five or six investment banks that stepped up with some pretty competitive quotes on that 10-year fixed rate deal.","Art Coppola","The only other thing I would add to that, Tom, is look, regional malls remain one of the most attractive asset categories for lenders to place long-term fixed rate mortgages on.","Ronald Camden","Great. And then just going back to the same-store NOI. One, if I back out the lease termination fees, my quick math is showing 2.1% growth for the quarter. One, is that right? And then when you look to 2017, is it possible where it's a tale of two halves? Meaning that maybe some of the weakness you are seeing gets more impacted in the first half of the year and then you have a pick up in the second? Thank you.","Tom O'Hern","Well, there's two parts to that. Number one, I think your math is right, but I am not sure the logic is right. Lease termination revenue is part of our business. So we are making an active decision to take the cash now rather than spread it out over subsequent quarters. So although it causes lumpiness, we think it should be in the calculation of same-center NOI.","It's not like straight lining a rent in FAS 141 that are non-cash items. It's a business decision that loads to cash revenue. So that's why we factor it in. I think next year what we will see in the first half of the year is, we will be going against very tough comps in the first and second quarter, because we still had the comparative benefit in 2016 of the expense cuts. So that may cause some of what you were referring to as a tale of two halves with the same-center NOI being higher in the second half of the year than the first.","Ronald Camden","Great. Very useful. Thanks so much.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Floris Dijkum with Boenning.","Floris Dijkum","Great. Thanks guys. A quick question for Art. Maybe if you could comment on your view towards share buybacks at the moment?","Art Coppola","We have completed our program. Nothing else is on our radar screen.","Floris Dijkum","So despite the fact that I think your average share buyback was around $80, if I am not mistaken, even though the share price is lower, you wouldn't contemplate buying back more stock at the moment?","Art Coppola","It was actually $78. Look, this is something we look at periodically. At this point in time, the best use of our capital is to put it back into our business. We are pleased with the program that we did. We announced it. We executed it. We are done with it. And now the best use of our capital and attention and focus is on our core business and reinvesting in our core business.","Floris Dijkum","Great. And could you maybe also comment on your relationship with Cadillac and GIC because they are both partners and have been partners in assets and also in your stock? Does that change the dynamics at all?","Art Coppola","The relationship with each of them is very good. Different types of relationships. GIC has proven to be a very good partner. We see eye-to-eye in terms of the future of our real estate. Cadillac, obviously, we have had a longstanding relationship with them for over 20 years and they have been a great operating partner also. So even if we don't have real estate in joint venture anymore, just because of the overall broad relationship, we continue to share best practices, we continue to share cross-border movement of tenants to the north and to the south. So that's a very productive and positive relationship and The Macerich Company is better for it.","Floris Dijkum","Great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. So going to your informal same-store NOI guidance for 2017, what has to implicitly happen to, or embedded in that guidance has to happen to either lease spreads or overall tenant sales productivity to hit the low-end or high-end?","Tom O'Hern","Well, the leasing spreads are pretty much dictated. We have got three quarters of this year through and that's what pushes the revenue that you recognize from re-leasing spreads. So really, it's a function of occupancy and whether there's occupancy fluctuation, whether we are able to lease-up is some space such as the Sports Authority space we got back. We had six Sports Authorities that closed and although that doesn't show up in the occupancy stats because that's an anchor, it's nonetheless got an economic impact. So if we were to fill some of that space sooner rather than later, that would have a positive impact on that range. That's probably the biggest variable.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just the second question, I actually got it from a client of mine. Maybe it's not always about anchor store closures, but are you having any conversations with some of your anchors where they are asking to put more CapEx into a mall or resolve some things sooner than you would like, in a way for them to stay in the mall?","Art Coppola","No. I actually have to laugh a little bit because the conversation is the flip of that. It's us talking to them, because we are always ahead of them in terms of our forward thinking, in terms of keeping our malls up-to-date and reminding them of what we are doing and suggesting to them that they join forces with us and update their store, while we are updating the mall.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Christine McElroy with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. I guess it is still good morning out there.","Art Coppola","Hi Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Hi. I am curious, you think back over the last 18 months and you met, you executed in relation to your stock trading at a big discount to your NAV, was selling assets, returning capital to shareholders through special dividends as well as share buybacks, financing a lot and extending your maturities, lowering your interest costs and then obviously focusing on margins. All of the things that one would expect to drive stock. And as you were doing your opening comments and talking about how the stocks have been quite volatile since August, I guess I was starting to think about well, what does that mean? Your stock is at $70. What's the honing in on, in terms of frustration with that and what you could do? And I recognize you want to use all your excess capital to put it into your assets right now, but I guess as you start to think about furthering asset sales or interest in asset sales or other means to arguably arb what is still a pretty large discount and take advantage of the volatility in the marketplace?","Art Coppola","No. That's a good question. I wish you would have asked me that question on August 1, when we were trading north of $91 a share. It would have been easier to answer. Today, look, we are not traders in our stock. We always, if anything, have had a very long view in terms of value creation and we firmly believe that if we do the right thing by the real estate and we do the right thing in terms of our performance that over time we will be rewarded with a reasonable share price. And I think if you look back at our 21-year history as a public company, our total shareholder returns have reflected the fact that when you do good things at a real estate level and put up good results, you generate well above average, in our case, top quartile returns compared to the broader index.","I can not ignore the fact that we are in the bottom quartile as a group and as a company this year compared to all REITs. Like I said in my comments, I feel all of your pain. We are doing what we can do to address the things that we can address and we are trying to share our views on some of the things like Macy's store closures, occupancy costs [indiscernible], influence re-leasing spreads, the health of the specialty store business. We try and address those for you, so that you can see our views and maybe have another viewpoint.","But look, it's a very fair question. But we are in this for the long haul. I think we are extremely well-positioned, Michael, for the near and long term and we are open to all ideas at all times. But the idea of trading in our stock is not something that we would find to be appealing at this point in time.","Michael Bilerman","But I am thinking about the public market investors are obviously more fickle and they can trade by the second. The private market investors, maybe you can share some of those conversations or whether they have expressed the similar concerns about the fundamentals and how they perceive asset values. Because if you aren't going to buy your stock, you certainly have the opportunity which you have done clearly with Heitman, with GIC to sell interest in assets to modify an arb, the public versus private market disconnect or maybe there is concern with the public markets? I am trying to get a sense where that sits.","Art Coppola","Okay. Let me refine my answer for you. Thank you for clarifying the question. We think we have an extremely good pulse on the private market's view on our portfolio, our sector and our company and in particular, our properties. And we felt that it was important a year ago to monetize that view and to show to the rest, to all of you, that was the way that we saw the private markets valued our assets and we felt at the time there was a significant disconnect between the private market's views on our company and the public markets views.","The private market's views on our asset base have not changed. If we were to go out today and talk about a similar pool of assets that we joint ventured, I would suspect that we would be looking at a similar execution. But the discrepancy and the disparity and the percentage differential between the public market and the private market valuations of our company have arguably never been greater than they are today.","So that is true. It is a fact. And we will keep a pulse on it. In the meantime, what we need to do is to continue to earn the appreciation for our portfolio by increasing the income and the valuation of each of our assets, which is what we are doing. But look, the private market, public market disparity has probably, I can't remember when it's been greater, but it, certainly, is very high today and much higher than it was a year ago.","Michael Bilerman","Right. And I guess part of the hesitation of selling more joint venture interest is you are encouraged by the potential growth in value as you invest in your assets and while you could arb some of that spread today by selling a 50% interest, pick Queens or Kings or do something there, you lose that potential upside in terms of growth. And so you have this, I guess your optionality or your options are a little bit more limited to narrow that spread. Does that make sense?","Art Coppola","Okay. And my view is that it's a huge disparity. If we see an opportunity with a long term view to deliver value to our shareholders, by monetizing that disparity, it's something we have considered in the past, as recently as a year ago and we would consider it in the future, but not today.","Michael Bilerman","All right. Thanks for your time guys. Have a good weekend.","Art Coppola","Thank you Mike. All right. Well listen, thank you all for your participation. We look forward to seeing you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks and on our tour on the day that Jean Wood announced. So thank you and see you in a couple weeks.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Macerich Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would -- all participants are in a listen-only mode. The following presentation will conduct a Q&A session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for question.","I would now like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded. And I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Jean Wood","Thank you everyone for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainty and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press filing and SEC filings.","During this quarter, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing; and John Perry, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with our past practice, we will be limiting today's call to one hour, if we run out of time and you still have questions, please don't hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. It was another strong quarter for us. We executed on our plan to disclose non-core assets and we had a very good operating performance during the quarter.","Looking at the operating metrics, we continue to see good fundamentals, including leasing spreads which came in at 14.8% for the quarter and just to point out on that stat. Those are cash basis rents for us. They do not include straight lining of rents which would have the effect of widening that spread to something significantly greater than 14.8%.","Occupancy was, came in very high at 95.1%. That was up significantly from the 93.4% reported a year ago. It is also important to note that we reduced our temporary occupancy as part of that statistic. It\u2019s down to 5.5% and that compared to 6.3% at March 31st of last year. Year end it was 5.8%. So down 20 basis points from year end and we will continue to focus on converting the temporary tenants from an occupancy as we typically see $20 to $25 a foot pickup when we do that.","Average base rents are getting very close to $50 a foot. They came in at $49.21 that\u2019s up 7.7% from a year ago and more importantly, up 2.2% from 12\/31\/13.","FFO for the quarter was $0.81 per share, that\u2019s compared to $0.86 per share in the first quarter of last year. We were within our guidance range, which for the first quarter was $0.81 to $0.83. Same-center NOI was 3.5% growth compared to year ago, that increase was driven by occupancy gains, positive releasing spreads and the annual CPI increases.","As mentioned in the earnings release this morning, during the quarter we have higher than expected costs for snow removal and utilities as a result of the harsh winter weather conditions throughout much of the East and the Midwest. We got about 45% of our portfolio that is in cold weather parts of the country.","Total incremental cost was $2.7 or $0.02 a share in terms of the FFO impact and about $1.7 million of those incremental costs negatively impacted the same-center pool. So excluding those costs same-center NOI would have been closed to 4.5% growth.","As a result of those costs, operating also declined to 64.9% including JVs at pro rata and that was down from about 66% a year ago. Compared to the first quarter of \u201813 we had dilution from assets sales during the quarter of about $0.06 per share. Most of that related assets sold in the second half of 2013.","Debt expense for the quarter was a modest $800,000 and that compared to $700,000 in the first quarter of last year. During the quarter the average interest rate was up slightly at 4.2%, compared to 4.13% in the first quarter of 2013.","The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end our balance sheet metrics included debt-to-market cap of 39%, interest coverage ratio of 3.1 times, debt-to-EBITDA on the forward basis of 7.2 times, average debt maturities of 5.6 years and floating rate debt percentage of about 10%.","Also this morning's press release we reaffirmed our FFO guidance that range continues to be $3.50 to $3.60 a share. And also I want to point out that our quarterly split remained unchanged. We do give quarterly guidance and we break that FFO out. First quarter 23%, second quarter 23% and the total third quarter 25% and the fourth quarter 29%.","Looking at tenant sales, the total portfolio mall tenant sales per foot came in at $565 for the year, that's based on the portfolio we have at the end of the quarter and that compared to the portfolio we owned at March 31, 2013, which had sales per foot of $535.","Looking on the same-center basis, excluding the impact of dispositions sales per foot at March 31 of \u201814 were $565 and that compared to $560 for the same pool of assets at March 31 of \u201813, that same group of assets was $565 at year end. So essentially flat compared to year end. Looking at the regions, Arizona, Northern California were up slightly and the East and Central regions were down slightly for this portfolio.","And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks Tom and welcome to our call. I\u2019m very pleased with our operating results for the quarter. I\u2019m very are pleased with our continued pruning of our portfolio. As I look at the -- our disposition program over the last year, we have successfully brought ourselves to a position where over 90% of our EBITDA is coming from centers that are doing over $600 square foot.","If we didn\u2019t sell one more properly in our bottom 10 of our portfolio, just simply executing on our redevelopment pipeline over the next two or three years is willing to bring our portion of NOI coming from centers that are doing over $600 a foot to something over 95%. And obviously, if we use future dispositions as a source of funding our redevelopment program, we can get to our goal of getting to virtually 100% of our NOI coming from a quality centers.","We are going to be opportunistic on any future dispositions. I want to make one correction, on our last call I indicated that, I felt that the average cap rate on the centers that we would be selling this year would be something close to 9%.","Having sold a couple of centers were sold in the first quarter and now when I look at what is likely in the possible disposition path that we are looking at right now, I would say the average cap rate in terms of combined cap rate on this group of assets will likely be closer to 8% to 9%.","On the redevelopment pipeline itself, we are very pleased at some recent developments that have taken place. Tysons Corner continues to come online. You can take a look at photographs. I believe of Tysons Corner on the Tysons Corner website within the macerich.com website.","And the Plaza you can really begin to see the integration of the Plaza that we are building and how it\u2019s going to connect to the metro rail and how it\u2019s going to tie all of the towers together and really create a new 50-yard line at Tysons Corner. As I have mentioned on previous call, we finally beginning to see rate leasing momentum inside of the mall as the retailers are beginning to realize what a game changer this is.","Just last week, I was up at Broadway Plaza and it\u2019s really quite impressive. Again, I would encourage you to go to the Broadway Plaza property website and you can see that we have already demolished the 600 car parking deck that is located between Nordstrom and Macy's and we demolished about 85,000 square feet of shops space.","So that the entire area that sits Nordstrom and Macy's is now pretty much demolished and we will have the parking deck that we will be servicing Nordstrom primarily, a new five-level deck, we hope to have that open by the end of November.","And it\u2019s really impressive to see the amount of land area that we are recapturing by taking this old one-level decks and replacing them with multi-level decks and of course, that\u2019s the way that we are able to take the gross leasable area and demolish 85,000 feet but bring a new 320,000 feet or so for net increase of just over 230,000 feet.","So very bullish on that and again, if you can visit the area or just take a look at the photos on our website. You can see, how dramatic this is, I mean, we are literally tearing down 60% of the GLA of this center and 80% of the parking of the center and when we bring it back online over the next couple of years, it is going to be a superpower house.","We had a milestone at Santa Monica Place and that we obtain city council approval for the addition of the ArcLight Theater that\u2019s going to go on top of Bloomingdale's and service the third level of Santa Monica Place.","We are also selected as the exclusive developer to have exclusive negotiation with the city through potential build another ArcLight theater about a block away from Santa Monica Place, where we have ownership of that and we will see that we believe very good returns and we think that bringing new theaters back to City of Santa Monica and predominantly at Santa Monica Place is going to drive a lot of traffic back to the hub of Santa Monica which is Santa Monica Place.","So over the past five years, the city of Santa Monica has lost over 1.1 million theater goers per year due to the poor quality of the theater offerings that are currently in Santa Monica and bringing those theater goers back to Santa Monica Place primarily with the opening of our new theater there next year. We expect great addition to our foot traffic and retention of customer at this stellar center.","As we look at our redevelopment pipeline, we anticipate that over the next quarter or two, we\u2019ll be moving several of the shadow pipeline assets up into the in-progress group. And we\u2019re very pleased with all of our efforts there.","Two other items that I want to talk about before we open up the call for questions. One, it relates to the inter-relationship of our retailers dotcom efforts in their omni-channel strategies and their brick-and-mortar strategies. And I know this always has been on the mind of many investors over the past six months.","All of us as landlords have been convinced that the omni-channel approach makes each of the channels more productive for retailers. And with this purpose, we will define omni-channel as being full price outlet and catalog and\/or dotcom. So we\u2019ve been talking to a lot of retailers about how we can assist them in their omni-channel efforts and also just getting a better understanding so that we can give you more clarity in terms of what does their emphasis on their catalogs or the dotcom site mean to their brick-and-mortar strategies.","We were meeting the other day with one retailer who is upsizing their stores dramatically, taking their stores from say 7,000 feet up to 40,000 or 50,000 square feet. And this particular retailer said that one of the reasons that they did that is that their websites are really very two dimensional. And it really doesn\u2019t give the customer the opportunity to get a full appreciation for the product that they are offering.","And they found that when they build these bigger stores and they can put more SKUs into the stores, that actually increases the sales of the items that they are able to put into the brick-and-mortar stores by 50% to 150% on their dotcom or their catalog side. So that gives you further insight into the inter-relationships of the brick-and-mortar stores and the dotcom strategy.","They feed each other. They supplement each other and it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driving many of our better retailers to seek out flagship stores. As we see people like H&M, Forever 21, Zara, Restoration Hardware, just to name a few as they are top shop. As they are building out their flagship stores, a lot of this is -- and they are building them predominantly in either A malls or A street locations. It\u2019s really to further their brand recognition as well as to just make their entire omni-channel strategy drive more retail sales.","The final thing I want to talk about before we open it up for questions is releasing spreads and why it is that we are so confident that we can maintain strong releasing spreads even in a flat sales environment. On the last call, I made reference to the fact that we are taking a look at our top 20 centers.","And within our top 20 centers, if we take a look at only the top two-thirds of our tenant within our top 20 centers that we found that those tenants tended to do about 40% more than the mall average. So I mentioned for example in our top 10 centers that currently average $855 a square foot.","If we take the top two-thirds and that\u2019s just by headcount, if you have nine shoe stores, you take the top six. If you have three jewelry stores, you take the top two. If you have 12 apparel stores, you take the top eight, that type of thing. If you take a look at our top 10 centers, you find that the top two-thirds of our tenants do 38% more than the average. They tend to about three times as much business as the bottom one-third.","And we found as we were through our entire listing of 52 malls that we currently own, that that really holds true in every single center that we own. On average, the top two-thirds of our tenants do 41% more than the mall average. So currently we have mall average of $565 of square foot for our 52 malls.","The top two-thirds of our tenants within that group -- within all of our malls average almost $800 of square foot. And so the challenge for us is to -- and the business that we are in is to take advantage of the creation of new retail concepts and to target those tenants that are not doing the average mall sales per square foot. And to replace them with new concepts whether the new concept be a new retailer or it could be the expansion of an existing retailer that\u2019s looking for flagship store.","It\u2019s fascinating. As I look at our bottom 10 centers that averaged $295 a square foot, within that grouping, the top two thirds of the tenants within that grouping do over $422 a square foot. So again the opportunity there is to take the unproductive tenants and to replace them either with new retail concepts or in those type of centers, maybe either to introduce junior anchor such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Ross, people like that.","So we have great confidence that with the quality of our portfolio and the strength of the locations that we have and when you look at the density that we have in each of our submarkets, the high barriers-to-entry that we have in each of our submarkets, the strength of the law of supply and demand where we have basically the only choice that the tenant wants to be in our market.","And you have increasing demand from the tenants that we are going to be able to continue to put up strong releasing spreads as we have over our entire 20-year public history and even stronger spreads in the future when we move to a position where well over 95% of our income will be coming from centers that are clearly A or A plus malls.","And with that, I would like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Go ahead sir.","Art Coppola","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey, good morning out there. Just a few questions here. First of all, Art, you guys have outlined the dispositions and the impact that it had on sales productivity. But can you sort of give some framework around how it has improved cash flow or releasing spreads, just something quantifiable that we would see over the next few quarters or next year or two where we would see it come into the numbers, the improvements that you guys have made to the portfolio by selling the lesser productive assets?","Art Coppola","Well, it is going to come in two forms and look this is a marathon, not a sprint. So it\u2019s not going to show up necessarily in this quarter or next. But look the long-term goal was to take in recycle well over $1 billion of assets that we\u2019re doing $320, $330 a foot and to recycle that cash into proven winners and that\u2019s currently being done in our redevelopment pipeline which is identified in our supplement.","So that will show up as we bring those projects online. We also have talked about the fact that in previous calls, that a year ago, if you look at our top 40 malls and you compare that to the 25 malls that were behind them that the growth rates over the last five years, the same center growth rates in the top 40 malls was significantly higher than the bottom 25.","And we have already disposed them -- let\u2019s say 15 of those have bottom 25. And we think that that is going through definitely just -- we are going to have addition by subtraction by taking away some of the centers that had either slower or flat or negative growth rates which was the profile of the bottom 25 and having more focus for our management team to focus on our better centers and really having a better and a stronger landlord-tenant conversation or when you are sitting down with the tenant, virtually every store that they have with you is a winner. It just puts you in a stronger position.","So look at this point, I could say we are going to just have to let time prove out the thesis. But we know that there is zero question that recycling over a $1 billion of capital that was sitting in centers doing $320 a foot and pushing it into centers that are doing 700 to 800, 900 dollars of square foot. That by itself is going to lead to very powerful results. And time will prove the thesis and we are just going to have to -- we're certain that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. And we\u2019ll have to prove it out overtime.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then as far as further dispositions, I mean it seems like everyone is now jumping into the fashionable trend of disposing the lower tier malls. But doesn't sound like from your comments that pricing has been impacted. So are you seeing more buyers coming out of the woodwork, or are you seeing the existing cash -- usual suspects just increasing their appetite to just buy more of the malls that are on the market?","Art Coppola","There\u2019s definitely more buyers today than a year ago. There is more buyers today than three months ago and their appetite I believe are much bigger than they were three months ago or a year ago. And I think look, part of that was a function of the fact that they realized that just because you call it a B mall, doesn\u2019t mean that this doesn\u2019t have a reason to B, to live. And they realized that if they are focused on that type of product then they can obtain good results. There is some proven operators out there that have done pretty well in terms of their leasing of B mall type of portfolios. And look, with the appetite as I see it is much bigger than it was three months, maybe even six months ago of the existing pool of buyers. And hypothetically, they are at least one or two new buyers that are going to be coming out here soon that may end up wanting to add to their portfolios.","I think the market is only going to warm up over the next year. But we had already decided when we gave guidance this year that we had pretty accomplished what we wanted to accomplish with our disposition program. And then we sold off a couple of more centers here in this quarter. This year's disposition target guidance is pretty modest at $250 million and we are going to be -- we've heard from investors that they would prefer a see us try and time our dispositions with reinvestment opportunities and so I think we are going to be listening to that. But the market is clearly warmer today than it was three months ago and harder than a year ago. I mean, a year ago it was more of a hypothetical as to what, how deep the market was. But there are clearly platforms that are trying to be formed or have already been formed.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","And just finally, Tom, did you mention Victor Valley, are you going to refi that or pay it off when it comes due later this year?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I mean, that\u2019s opened but certainly it\u2019s a refi candidate and the centers done well and so we will probably be refinancing it.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Floating or fixed?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Our preference is fixed, long-term fixed and the rates are still extremely attractive and the tenure has hung in there. It bounces between 260 and 280, and there is certainly a fair amount of both life company and CMBS debt out there. So it's still a great time to be a borrower if we go fixed and long.","Art Coppola","If we talk about turning B malls and A malls, if you just look at the two-dimensional number of sales per square foot you could argue that that\u2019s what we did in Victor Valley over the past several years. We have two brand new department stores. We have -- one of them being a brand new expanded JCPenney, which is doing very well. We have a brand new Macy's at every place that had replaced the Bacon department store and then we have a brand new Dick's Sporting Goods that replaced the old smaller 50,000 foot JCPenney.","And as a consequence of that, on a sales per foot of that center are now in the excess of $500 of square foot and we are showing strong sales growth trends there and strong income growth and so it looks and feels great. So that\u2019s an example of it. But was probably a small market, tertiary market or secondary market but it\u2019s within the greater sort of California area and we could argue that was an example of taking a B mall and turning it into an A mall.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Art Coppola","Hi, Christie.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Hi, good morning to you guys. Art, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about the average cap rate of the sales being closer to 8% than 9%. I think you talked about selling four to five malls. You've sold three so far. I'm sure you can appreciate sort of our willingness or desire to get a sense for sort of the valuation split between B and C. I think you talked about one of those four to five being a B mall. So I am -- can you disclose the cap rate on the assets that you've sold or maybe an average of the three and talk about maybe the split there in that 8%?","Art Coppola","Well, the ones that have been sold today were clearly C malls.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Right.","Art Coppola","And frankly at this point in time, I could argue that we have no more C malls. So anything that would be sold from this point forward in my view I would consider it to be a B mall. And the cap rates on C malls, you can\u2019t really peg them. They are really hard to think. On going forward 2014 numbers, look, they were clearly double digits in the low teens but they were small centers that were going in the wrong direction. And they were bought by opportunistic people who have a plan to turn them around.","The remaining one or two or three and I don\u2019t know, how many it will be centers that will sell that gets within that guidance range will likely command cap rates that are closer to the cap rates on the centers that we sold last year, which is closer to the low 7s to the mid7s. So that\u2019s why I was modifying our guidance here to say that the combined cap rates for the dispositions this year is probably going to be closer to 8 and the 9 that I indicated in our last call. The C malls, it\u2019s really hard to peg -- Tom, what was the average sales per foot on the centers that we sold?","Tom O\u2019Hern","It was in the low 200s, Art. And we\u2019ve kind of broken it out in the supplement on Page 14. The three that we sold this year with the average 244 a foot.","Art Coppola","And they were all C malls. And they were all over 10% type of cap rates and they all had income that was declining. So it\u2019s hard to say what that number is. But we think that the B mall market is north of $300 a foot, mid 300s that type of thing. But there is still strong appetite for this type of centers.","Christy McElroy - Citi","And that strong appetite that you mentioned is what caused you to revise that number down from the 8% to 9%, it is not a function of the mix of assets that you are selling?","Art Coppola","It\u2019s really just a recalculation frankly of looking at what got sold and looking at what we are talking about during now and just looking at the reality of what I now see.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Okay. And then on Kings Plaza, your sales are down about 7% year-over-year. How much of that decline was weather-related versus the major remerchandising effort that you have got going on there?","Bob Perlmutter","This is Bob Perlmutter. It was probably a combination of all those things. Clearly, if you look at the detail of the East Coast centers, were impacted by the weather but we also like you say have a lot of moving pieces, including a lot of new leases that are getting signed and a renovation in process. So that asset is probably likely to be impacted a little bit by all those items and fluctuate a little bit more over the next 12 to 24 months.","Christy McElroy - Citi","And those new leases, are those lower productivity, which is impacting the average?","Bob Perlmutter","No, the new leases won't go into the comp sales until they\u2019ve been open for year and actually many of the tenants will have the opportunities to significantly improve the productivity. People like Michael Kors and Fossil, some of the higher productivity tenants that are coming into the center.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Thank you so much, guys.","Bob Perlmutter","Thanks, Christine.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV. Go ahead, sir.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Hi. Good morning. Art, you mentioned kind of upsizing stores that we view it as strategic to have bigger stores. What\u2019s your experience been in terms of the rents per foot you can get because you might think the opposite, that it is better to have smaller stores because smaller stores usually pay higher rents, since you'd rather have 10 small stores paying higher rents, unless you are getting the same types of big rents from bigger boxes and what\u2019s your experience been when you have had those upsized stores?","Art Coppola","It depends on the center. So if it\u2019s center that\u2019s $300 a foot and you are adding a junior anchor, chances are you are going to -- your rents are going to go down a little bit but you pick it up with the occupancy gains. But given that that\u2019s not really what we own anymore and give them our top 40 centers now and producing over $600 of square foot. We consider them all to be A centers. What happens in those centers and particularly as you go up the quality spectrum and you get up into the top 20 centers. When a tenant comes to us, part of the strong omni-channel retailer strategies is to have kind of hub and spoke type of retail, brick and mortar locations. So they like to have sometimes a big store in a great location and there maybe a few other smaller stores in other locations in the market.","So if you happen to own the best location in a given market, which we do in quite a few markets and they come to us and they say, look, we are interested in taking and building a flagship store. What the answer is that from a supply viewpoint that\u2019s very hard to create. And you have to assemble spaces to create that and we\u2019ve actually had experiences that when tenants come to us and they would normally be a 10,000 to 12,000 foot tenant and they say that they want a 20,000 foot flagship store.","We\u2019ve had experiences that we can get more rent per foot for the bigger store than for the more typical store. And it\u2019s just because of the law of supply and demand. We cannot create in a center, 20,000 foot stores. That would take away from the comparison shopping and the experience that shoppers expect. So when retailers ask us to do something or to create a space that is highly unusual and it happens to be in a great center, which is exactly where these flagship stores want to be located. We found that from a pricing discussion that we actually can get more rent per foot than for their more typical stores.","Bob Perlmutter","Paul, this is Bob Perlmutter. One of the other effects of doing these flagship stores is very often it allows us to move the retailers that are there in these areas were doing well into lesser areas of the centers. So there is sort of related affect that we are accumulating the space. We are able in many cases to get a premium for the accumulation, but we are also retaining the tenants are there albeit at lesser location than the center which also helps drive rents.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Yes, sure. And then my other question is just on the bankruptcies and kind of the state of your tenant watch list. We've had obviously a little bit of a tick up year-to-date off a very low level. And I am just wondering your thinking -- given what you said about the disparity between productivity within the mall, I mean could it maybe be beneficial that you are weeding out some of the underperformers that you normally see more of than we have in the past couple of years? What\u2019s your view on the net from the store closings year to date?","Art Coppola","Well, I think your comment is right in the sense that it\u2019s a little bit more active than it\u2019s been in past years, albeit past years have been extremely low level. So we are probably getting closer to normalized level. I think the second thought is, this is something that goes in the retail business, in the mall business for the last 20 years in terms of tenants growing and expanding and then contracting. So there is a constant rollover which provides us opportunities to bring in more productive tenants.","I think the other point is, we\u2019ve been -- many of these bankruptcies like a Coldwater Creek have been evident for a number of years. And so, we look at Coldwater as potential opportunity. They are generally better locations and are best centers with moderate rents. I think their average fixed minimum rent with us is $36, so that presents an opportunity. My only point here is we have been thinking about this for the last two years. This really isn\u2019t new news and we have been both reducing our count with them as well as trying to line up deals on the belief that they would have actually go bankrupt.","Paul Morgan - MLV","So the closings year-to-date hasn't had any impact on kind of what you think you are going to be from a same-store and occupancy perspective in the year?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I think it\u2019s all been factored into our guidance.","Art Coppola","No, again, these aren\u2019t surprises when you look at Brookstone and Coldwater Creek and Sbarro and some of the others certainly not unexpected we have been planning for it and even counting on it frankly.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Thanks.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group. Go ahead.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Thank you. Art, you talked about the lower cap rate on the dispositions. Is there any change in your timing? I recall in the fourth quarter call, you talked about the dispositions being front-end loaded. Is it still front-end loaded or will they be spread a little bit more over the balance of the year?","Art Coppola","At this point in time, we obviously have some front-end loaded dispositions on the two that were sold, but those were small deals. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly when balance of the dispositions will happen. Frankly, we have a deal on the contract that fell out of contract and that was what was causing us to talk about it being front-end loaded. So now it\u2019s hard to predict buyer\u2019s behavior and we can\u2019t control our buyers\u2019 behavior. I am convinced that we will sell $250 million or so of assets this year, but it would be hard for to be front-end loaded now given that there is nothing under contract at this point in time. So it\u2019s going to be more loaded towards the mid to the latter part of the year at this point in time.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Okay. In your development schedule also this quarter, you raised the yield -- increased the yield on a Niagara outlet expansion. I just wonder if you could talk about what was driving that. I think the costs actually were increased a little bit, so presumably it reflects demand in pricing. I wonder if you could talk about that, as well as the prospects for other expansions at any of the other outlet center projects in the portfolio?","Art Coppola","It was just a recalculation of what we saw, the return to be based upon the rents that we are getting and we lease it down into a pro forma. We think that we are getting -- it\u2019s going to cost us X dollars to build it. We are going to get Y dollars in rent, So weather did drive up the cost a little bit, but the rents that we are getting are better than what we had put into our original pro forma. So this is just simple recalculation.","As far as Fashion Outlets of Chicago, it\u2019s doing great. If we could expand it, we would have demand to expand it, but at this point in time there are no plans or even obvious opportunities to do any expansions. We are looking at potential other outlet opportunities around the country that are similar in nature to Fashion Out of Chicago in terms of their urbanity and density of population. And so it\u2019s possible that during the course of this year that we will be making an announcement that we\u2019ve identified an opportunity or two.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Okay. And then final question for me, in terms of Santa Monica Place, sales productivity there has been increasing nicely over the last several quarters and you have the theater coming. Can you just remind us -- I know that the occupancy has declined from year end 2012 I think by about 400 basis points or so, and there has been a little more turnover in the upper levels of that center. Can you just remind us, the theater will be cutting in at the third level I understand, and is that where the vacancy is and how optimistic -- well, not how optimistic, but when you think about the tenant mix on the third level, do you expect it to change in any material way from how you originally conceived it when you opened this theater?","Art Coppola","So no, where the theater is going, we never included it as vacant space. It was -- it is the third level of an old Macy\u2019s building and it was roughly 50,000 feet. So when we redid the center we convinced Macy\u2019s to convert their 3 level Macy\u2019s building to a 2 level Bloomingdale\u2019s building and the theater is simply going into the -- what used to be the 3rd level of Macy\u2019s and it\u2019s really space that if you walk the center, you really wouldn\u2019t know it was even there.","Whatever occupancy changes or reductions that you would see in our disclosures that would be likely the result of the fact that we are in a second generation of releasing Santa Monica Place now which is extremely early. Usually when you build a new center, it takes just 7 to 10 years to be able us to move into a second generation of re-leasing opportunities. But when we leased Santa Monica Place it was spring of 2009, it was the worst time possible to be leasing it, and we weren\u2019t able to get as many upscale or branded or luxury retailers as the market deserves. And so what we are doing right now is we are recycling tenants that probably shouldn\u2019t have been there long-term anyway with more appropriate tenants. Do you want to talk a little bit further about the re-letting of that and the impact of the theater on the 3rd level, Bob?","Bobby Perlmutter","Yes, I mean, Jim to your question about the 3rd level, the 3rd level has obviously been designed and merchandised for food uses. And so that having the theater up on the third level is obviously going to have a materially beneficial impact in bringing traffic to that 3rd level. It really allows us to do two things and allows us to generate more business for the existing food users are there, but it also allows us to bring in new food users and upgrade the quality and bring in what we believe will be some high volume users. So I would say before the end of the year you are going to hear a couple of announcements with some new restaurants up there that who is interested is directly related to the fact that there is going to be start of the art theater in a market that is desperately in need of a quality theater operation.","Art Coppola","And you are going to see continued announcements of new upscale branded retailers, so they are going to be coming into the sector.","Bobby Perlmutter","Yes, best the best example we recently signed a lease with DPF to come into the center which would be new to the market and you will continue to see the luxury build on the lower level and the traditional specialty mall tenants on the second level.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Good. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.","Art Coppola","Good afternoon.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Good morning to you. Thanks for taking my questions. Art, I guess, as you consider the projects you are moving from your shadow pipeline to the in-progress, can you provide an update on Green Acres? Were you looking at a big box center and as part of that, can you talk about how you are thinking about traditional versus fast fashion retailers when you think about filling the big-box space?","Art Coppola","I see the pre-leasing of the 20 acres of land that we have at Green Acres, it\u2019s coming along extremely well. We are really in the entitlement trades there right now. We do have retailer, we are expanding H&M there, Bob. That\u2019s not on the 20 acres, so that\u2019s on the mall. So there is two things that are happening. One, we are taking that the 20 acres that we bought and we are in the middle of getting entitlements to populate it with traditional bog box uses and including potentially a new theater. The Green Acres is an interesting center. If you look at simply the sales per square foot which again can be a two dimensional number, it does $541 a foot. You look the top two-thirds of the tenants at Green Acres mall, they do $750 a square foot. So there is an opportunity there to recycle within the mall, so out some of the lower productive tenants and bring in some more productive tenants.","So right now we are in the entitlement phase. If we have the entitlements at Green Acres to do the -- to build out the 20 acre expansion site will be under construction today. We are getting those entitlements and the other thing that we are working on is the remerchandising of the mall itself.","So again, one thing I\u2019ll point out about Green Acres is that it does $541 a foot, which is an impressive number. But the more impressive number to me is the fact that the retail that sits on the site that we own today does over $800 million. When we finish this expansion that we\u2019re going to do, it\u2019s not inconceivable that this property will generate $1 billion of sales that would put it on par with Tysons Corner in terms of the sales that have been generated from the property. So we see this has a great opportunity for us and the only thing that\u2019s holding back the big box build-out on the 20 acres right now is the entitlements. Do you want to add anything to that, Bob?","Bobby Perlmutter","Yeah. Just a comment about -- that you asked about inside the mall, the fast fashion. As an example, we recently signed a lease with H&M who is an existing tenant, almost double the size of their space to go from about 12,000 to 22,000 feet. And we see additional opportunities like that within the mall. One of the interesting things about the H&M deal is they\u2019re actually going to do an interior and an exterior entrance which has been one of our goals to have more exterior pace in retail and take advantage of the traffic not only within the mall but on the entire site. And then secondly, the demand on the 20 acres from the big box tenants has been very strong and the rental levels are very strong, which has been reflected in the returns on the development.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So you certainly sound pretty enthusiastic and optimistic for the outlook. Is it conceivable to think that this could be a top 10, maybe top 20, but maybe a top 10 mall in terms of productivity in your portfolio? ","Art Coppola","(Indiscernible) but again that\u2019s kind of work I was touching upon. It will clearly be a top 10 center in terms of the retail sales that are generated from that site. It\u2019s hard to imagine that it would be a top 10 center in terms of sales per square foot, which really is something that I need to point out to you is that the sales per square foot numbers that you hear from landlords are little bit too dimensional. You have to drill down further to really understand what it all means. ","And at $541 a square foot, that\u2019s a good solid number. But when we looked at it as we\u2019re buying it, we said, wait a minute, this thing is doing over $800 billion of business, that\u2019s a massive retail complex. And when we get down with the expansion here and the remerchandising of the center, it is not inconceivable that it will be doing $1 billion of business, which clearly would be one of our top 10 centers in terms of total dollars that are generated in and that plays into the leasing. ","I mean, when retailers realize the volumes that have been done by other retailers, it creates interest and they don\u2019t really look at the ales per square foot of the itself when we\u2019re leasing space to them. They look at an examples of other peer retailers or is just opportunity that they think that they can fill?","Again, the pre-leasing that we\u2019ve got on the 20 acres is coming on very, very strong. We\u2019ve home good users, sporting goods users, furniture users, several restaurant users and we think it\u2019s a hidden opportunity. We were able to buy the 20 acres while we were under contract to buy the mall and as you can from the returns of the shadow pipeline, its going to be a very attractive addition and we think it will -- its going to just bring traffic to the site that will make the mall better also.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley ","A couple more quick ones here. Just curious, you talked a bit about your tenant percentage. Did you guys ever discuss or can you discuss what your target tenant percentage is and assuming the elevated levels go down once Broadway Plaza is completed?","Art Coppola","The historical number was close to 2% to 3%, to say 2.5% that got elevated as we went through the recession and we are just pushing occupancy rather than rate or quality of the occupancy. So, we think we get down to that level, 5.5% that gives this another 300 basis points over the next few years to convert that to the higher quality occupancy and pickup the incremental rent which as I said, we think, on average can be as much as $20 to $25 a foot.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley ","Okay. And then on Estrella Falls, the completion timing slipped a bit. Can you talk about that? ","Art Coppola","The Phoenix market is clearly recovering. I met a Board at this morning that it was the number one city in the United States for job creation in the finance category last year. Population growth is coming. But look there\u2019s going to be a one more full price regional mall build in the Phoenix Metroplex over the next five to eight years. It\u2019s going to be in West Phoenix. It is our belief.","We are on the site and there is just no reason to build it before we feel that we have a strong tailwind. And at this point in time we don't feel a strong tailwind at that particular location.","There are -- Phoenix coming back significantly in different areas in different submarket, that particular submarket has not come back with enough strength to give us the rent levels that we would like to get and so we have no rush to do anything there.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley ","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next call comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead sir.","Art Coppola","Hello","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Thanks. Good morning out there. Just first question on guidance. Apologies if I missed this. So you maintained FFO guidance for the year, but I was just wondering if you mentioned or maintained your same-store NOI growth forecast 3.75% to 4.25% just given the 100 basis point drag on the same-store from the weather and if so, what is the offset to that?","Art Coppola","Well, again, its one quarter. We don\u2019t expect the polar vortex to affect us negatively as we move forward through the rest of the year, so we view that as kind of a one time bump. So, I mean, absent that, we were running closer to the mid 4s, which is at or above our guidance rate. So we are still comfortable at that same-center NOI guidance for the year.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then how do you think about these costs going forward with new leases that you sign? I know it is, like you said, just one quarter, I guess, the fourth quarter last year was also a bit elevated, but how are those elevated costs overall factored into that CAM pool that you will build into new leases? Are they considered abnormal at all or one-time in nature? Do you sort of smooth them out using a two or three-year figure? How does that work?","Art Coppola","Well, typically on a CAM quote, we gives ourselves couple of dollars of margins there. I think that\u2019s consistent within the industry as we as an industry shifted away from triple net leases to fixed CAM. We believe we can control cost, but obviously, some cost such as utilities and snow removal as proved out this winter are 100% controllable. So there's always a little bit of cushion in that CAM quote and its considered as you quote CAM numbers to tenants as we go forward.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay.","Art Coppola","There\u2019s a still healthy recovery rate, our recovery rate is still in excess of 100% and that\u2019s because we do quote a little cushion in the CAM number.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then just last question, I think, I heard you mention that there maybe two new entrants into the B mall segment of the market that might emerge? Are these buyers that are, as you say, they are planning to own and operate portfolios or are they financial buyers that might look to partner up with an operator?","Art Coppola","Well. I mean one of the obvious ones that I can predict what they\u2019re going to do is the spinco off of Simon Property Group. I mean, who knows what they\u2019re going to do. With an investment grade rating, they would have the ability to be a very aggressive consolidator if they wanted to be, once they get up and running. So I can\u2019t predict to what they are going to do or I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do but they could clearly be our new player. And there are other private new players that are forming platforms that are new platforms that don\u2019t currently exist that our seeking to buy some B malls.","So it\u2019s just the depth and the breadth of the pool and the appetite of the pool. It is just much greater than it was a year ago. And it\u2019s really for good reasons. I mean, there is money to be made here in this category of asset. And particularly, if you have a management team that has got folks on it but have deep relationships in the big-box category killer power center type of backgrounds or community center backgrounds because one of the opportunities in this B malls is to introduce elements, that you would normally find any community center or power center. ","Remember that number that I put out there our bottom 10 properties average say $295 a foot. But embedded within that $295 a foot, top two-thirds of the tenants within the bottom 10 properties that we own, that average $295 a foot. The top two-thirds do over $422 a foot. So one of the opportunities for B mall buyer or some of those properties and we\u2019ve seen this happened might be to eat up some of the vacancy and bring in new junior anchors to those types of properties. I mean many of them are very viable properties.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","It looks like we\u2019ve got time for one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from DJ Busch from Green Street Advisors.","DJ Busch - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just one quick question for Tom. I was hoping you could provide a little more color on the current financing environment with regards to the appetite for movie goers and pricing spreads between some of the top centers and perhaps the lower productivity centers and some of those that you are trying to dispose of?","Art Coppola","I can certainly comment on the top quality centers. We recently were out and evaluating, getting bids on Biltmore, which is a good A quality center. And it was a pretty competitive bidding process and interestingly it was the life companies, very, very competitive for A quality space with the CMBS lenders and in fact the life companies were 10 to 20 basis point sharper than the CMBS shops.","And very competitive at rates for 10-year money in the low 4s. Although we haven\u2019t been out financing any lower quality assets, what I\u2019m hearing from the CMBS shops is they are all active. They\u2019re putting pools together. They are aggressive and they are definitely financing B-quality assets. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be any shortage of capacity right now from what we\u2019re seeing.","Tom O\u2019Hern","","And just to add on to that. We tend to keep the properties that we\u2019re going to sell. We try and keep them unencumbered. So that a buyer who may have an appetite for high leverage, which that\u2019s generally the profile of the private equity type of buyers that are out there, that they can have an opportunity to take the unencumbered asset and to leverage it up to the max, which generates better pricing for us.","So over half of our bottom 10 assets are unencumbered. And we have found that buyers prefer to put their own financing on properties than to inherit some of the finance that you might have. So I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll tend to keep assets that we think our future dispositions candidates unencumbered.","DJ Busch - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","All right, well, thank you everybody. We look forward to continuing to report to you during the balance of the year and seeing you at upcoming events. Thank you very much.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference today call today. And I thank you for your participation.

Consistent with past practice will be limiting the call to one hour, if we conclude and you still have questions please feel free to call me or John Perry or Jean Wood.","For the quarter FFO was $0.87 per share compared to $0.87 through the quarter end March 31 of 2016. December was slightly ahead of our guidance range which was primarily due to the timing of lease termination revenues. Same-center growth in NOI excluding straight line rents and SFAS 141 income was up 2.2% for the quarter. We have forecasted same-center growth for the year to be in the range of 3% to 4% and we are still comfortable with that range. We did expect the first quarter and second quarter would be the lowest quarter to be significant decline in occupancy roughly 80 basis points, resulting from the high number of tenant bankruptcies in the first quarter.","The gross operating margin for the quarter was 68.4% down slightly from 68.6% in the first quarter of last year, occupancy declines were the primary reason for this decrease. Bad debt expense for the quarter was 1.6 million, up slightly compared to 1.2 million in the first quarter of last year. Lease term fees were 2.7 million for the quarter, down compared to 3.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter the average interest rate was 3.57%, very comparable to 3.62% a year ago.","Looking at the balance sheet, it continues to be in very shape. At quarter end debt to market cap was 43%. The interest coverage ratio was 3.8 times which is the best in our history as a public company. The average debt maturity is also very strong at 6.2 years. We do not have much in front of us in terms of loans, maturing in the next two years with only 99 million maturing this year and 338 million in 2018.","The financing market remains good for us even as rates have increased and now come back down, the borrowing spreads decreased and we were able to do 10 year fixed rate loans at less than 4%. For example, in March we refinanced Kierland Common, we closed on a $225 million loan at 3.97%, the underlying treasury at that time was about 2.50% which means that the spread over the treasuries contracted as rates had gone up. The prior loan was a floating rate loan of a 130 million with 2.6% interest rate.","During March, we utilized the 140 million of sale proceeds from the sale of Northgate Mall, Cascade Mall in the office building at Country Club Plaza to buyback 1.5% of our shares, 2.2 million shares. The average buyback price was $64.18.","In the earnings release yesterday, we reaffirmed our estimate of EPS and diluted FFO per share guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.90 to $4, included in the guidance is $0.08 of dilution from the sale of Northgate Cascade and the office building at Country Club Plaza. No other 2017 dispositions or acquisitions are included in that guidance.","Other major assumptions include same-center NOI, I mentioned in the range of 3% to 4% and that remains unchanged. Lease terminations for the year estimated at 15 million, we originally forecast that revenue primarily to fall in the third and fourth quarter as noted previously some of that 2.7 million did hit in the first quarter and we expect that we will recognize some more lease termination revenue in the second quarter as well. Negatively impacting FFO in the first quarter was the write-down of the technology investment which after the tax effect had a negative FFO impacted about 6.5 million or $0.04 per share.","In early February, we were concerned, although not certain about the long-term liability of this investment accordingly we did consider in our original guidance.","My last comment on guidance is that although, we expect about $0.03 of accretion from the share buyback, we are not adjusting our guidance range at this time, but we will take a look at it after the second quarter results are in.","With that I would like to turn it over to Bob.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks Tom. First quarter results within the Macerich portfolio reflected a negative impact to occupancy caused by the recent tenant bankruptcies. Despite these headwinds, our high quality centers continue to produce strongly seemed spreads. Sales for the portfolio increased to $639 per square foot. Our trailing 12 month leasing spreads decreased slightly to 17.5% from the fourth quarter rate of 17.7%. Leasing spreads continue to be strong as at the top tier centers. Within the portfolio of the Top 30 centers generate sales of $739 per square foot and represent 80% of our annual net operating income. This performance provides the high degree of stability in the current environment.","Average rent for lease signed during the trailing 12 month period was $56.93 per square foot, up marginally from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter a total of 601,000 square feet of leases were signed, representing a decrease from the first quarter of 2016. New tenant leasing activity was consistent with the prior year. The average term for leases signed in the first quarter was 5.2 years.","Apparel shoes and Jewelry represented 40% of the quarter's activities while food and restaurants were 21% and cosmetics health and beauty were 17%. Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.3%, this represented an 80 basis points decrease on a year-over-year basis. Store closures from tenant bankruptcies during the first quarter accounted for a 50 basis points decline in occupancy. Temporary occupancy ended the first quarter at 5.3%.","Portfolio sales ended the first quarter at $639 per square foot, which represented a 2.2% increase on a year-over-year basis. On a same center basis trailing 12 month sales were $641 which represented a 1.9% year-over-year increase.","I would like to next take a couple of minutes discussing bankruptcies by reviewing the activity over the past three years. At the beginning of 2014, our current portfolio centers had a leasing level of 95.4%. We ended 2016 at 95.6%, effectively our total occupancy did not change over the three-year period. But during the same time period a total of 33 retailers located in these centers entered bankruptcy. These stores represented 255 locations with just over 1 million square foot which is roughly 5% of our non-anchor space.","Excluding the sport authority spaces approximately 450,000 [ph] square feet or 55% of the square footage was closed and liquidated. These closed tenants had an average base rent of $47 per square foot at the time they went into bankruptcy and they generates sales of only $253 per square foot. The sales were less than one half of our center averages. To date average base rent of $51 per square foot has been achieved on the releasing of this space.","Equally as important we've been able to replace weak retailers like Love Culture, RadioShack, Cache, Wet Seal and Coldwater Creek with more contemporary retail concepts that include Anthropology, Timberland, Vineyard Vines, [indiscernible], Adidas, Soft Surroundings and H&M. These tenants improved the draw of the individual properties and should generate sales at or above the portfolio of our average.","Bankruptcy activity is the beginning of 2017 has remained elevated. Today we have nine retailers who have declared bankruptcy totaling 69 locations with 342,000 square feet. These spaces had an average base rent of $47 per square feet and generate average sales of only $226. Clearly the low productivity of these stores has been the primary reason for the bankruptcies. We expect two additional retailers to announce bankruptcy during the second quarter. It is clear the leasing environment remains challenging, the quality of the portfolio provides great stability as retailer continue to seek out must have retail locations. The bankruptcy of weaker retailer presents challenges for the leasing teams, however it is also an opportunity to improve already strong assets.","In dealing with these bankrupt tenants, we try to make the right long term decisions for each property even if the shorter-term metrics are impacted.","The redevelopment in the former shares back at Kings Plaza is well underway and scheduled for fall 2018 opening. In addition to the previously announced anchors in Primark and Zara, we are completing deals for two additional retailers that will occupy the balance of this space. We expect to make announcements once leases are signed. Rational [ph] it's a field office proceeding with reconstruction and also schedule to open in 2018. Retailer interest continues to grow at the development and investment in downtown Philadelphia provide the unique opportunity to recreate and re-imagine three city blocks around the city transit hub.","In conclusion, despite the headwinds of specialties store bankruptcies our portfolio remains exceptionally strong and well leased. The replacement of lower productivity tenants within our centers has been consistent with the evolution of new retail formats for many years. Leasing spreads remain at historical levels and demand remains strong as illustrated by maintaining our occupancy despite over 1 million square feet bankruptcies over the last three years. We continue to believe the premier eight centers that propose our portfolio will increase their market share and importance in the omni-channel distribution of retailer's goods.","And with that I would like to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks Bob. Thanks Tom. I'm going to follow up little bit on what Bobby just spoke about regarding specialty store closers.","As I look at it and I ask Bobby and Tom to take a look at all of the closers that we've had, could have gone back over the history of mankind in the last 41 years, but we picked three years, and I look at that. If there were a tremendous number of amount of square footage that went through bankruptcy. But that\u2019s not unusual, that is something that is the way of the world. I would say that, as pointed out by one of my peers, some of those bankruptcies were maybe accelerated due to the retailer being burdened with too much of debt, and that was part of the private equity firm's ownership of that retailer.","But as Bobby pointed out at the end of the day it was really because they were lousy retailers, that\u2019s why they won't broke. And the definition of a lousy retailer is somebody who doesn\u2019t produced, Bobby mentioned the numbers of these retailers did $250 a foot.","So being the eternal optimist, frankly, I see bankruptcies as being a blessing in disguise because it takes a tenant who is occupying a space and producing no business and gives us back that space earlier than the normal expiration of the term. So that we can go in and do what we do every day, which is to take space and to recycle it into more up-to-date ideas and uses and concepts.","And if you look at it from a micro viewpoint over the last three years, from December of 2013 through March of 2017, our occupancies were the same. We had I think Bobby mentioned 1 million square feet of retailers go through bankruptcy. During that little over three-year period, the average base rents in our portfolio went from $41.88 a foot to $56.31 a foot for an increase of 34%. Total sales of all of our shopping centers that we own today compared to what we owned December 13, went from 562 a foot up to 639 a foot and if you just look at our Top 40 centers, they went from 604 a foot to 662 a foot. The percentage of NOI that we get from our top 40 centers increased from 89% of our total EBITDA 3.5 years ago to over 93% today.","So, my might take away, is that the bankruptcies of last three years helped us improve our portfolio, helped us bringing tenants at better rents, better ideas and at higher productivities. Those are what the macro numbers say and that what you see if you walk our malls.","I would point out one thing, I think Bobby mentioned, which some of you may or may not have picked up on, he talked about some of the new leasing deals being done at $51 a foot and you might asked yourself the question, well if you're average AVR is $56 a foot, what's going on. Well what's going on is that the guys that go broke are generally the guys aren\u2019t that good in the first place. And so therefore we put them in the weaker spots of the center that don\u2019t command the average base rate of the center.","So -- and by the way that explains -- when I look at the makeup of the retailers that are going broke this year and that might get broke, they pretty much also fit the same profile, they have been dead man walking, waiting to die and this just accelerates the process, so that we can move forward.","I want to talk about a point, moving away from leasing, that Tom mentioned regarding the write off of that private investment amount, the real estate investment that we had, and I know that at least one of you on the call likely asked question about that, as all S&P 500 companies do, we use venture capital investments as a way to stay abreast of what's happening amongst the disruptors and startups in our world as well as to incubate new ideas and to find new technologies.","Over the last couple of years, we've made about 8 investment totaling about $18 million in the various ideas, some of them are pure retailers that are about to open say their first, there second, there third full store, but the one that caused the write off was the different one. It was a large investment, it was $10 and it was into a platform that was designed and the thesis behind the company was that where they were going to essentially be a facilitator for digitally mated retailers as well as European retailers to open stores in the U.S. They build up a tremendous amount of overhead to support that ideas but they really build themselves as being the bridge between clinks and bricks. Which had they turned out to be that, it would have done a wonderful business, and would have been a terrific thing for us to use to bring new ideas and new concepts to our malls.","As Tom mentioned in early February there were issues regarding and it turns out that the company failed. Look we have some takeaways from that, we realized that we make significant investment into one company, but the other takeaway was that we are going to be best served to have us be the facilitators for clicks coming to bricks, we're not thinking about third parties being the one to get in the middle of that, we've been very successful in our early efforts on that in a couple of our veteran investments and then in early state investments, and some exciting retailers like Beta, Ministry of Supply each of which got a couple of locations open with us and more 4 or 5 on the way and provide exciting stores for us.","Going on a couple of other topics, you may have noticed in the development pipeline that we moved out the Candle Stick project two years, that's completely driven by the fact that we're partnering on that property with the master developer that controls over a thousand acres or so in the area, including [indiscernible] and you can well imagine that when you are dealing with a thousand acre development in a city like San Francisco that there are going to be delays in the implementation of the infrastructure, et cetera. Those we thought we were going be able to still maintain as scheduled, but as we look at it, the realistic opening is what we put out there now, leasing, pre-leasing is very strong to tremendous location and we\u2019re very bullish on the opportunities there.","One final point that I want to touch upon, which has been touched upon at [indiscernible], but unfortunately still appears to be in the drinking water that\u2019s poisoning the sentiment around public investors and their views towards mall [ph] companies. I will speculate that the U.S. is over retailed, I will speculate that the U.S. has too many department stores, I believe that as department stores shrink their fleet, as Macy's and Penny's, that is a fundamentally good move for Macy's and Penny's.","I've said it dozens of times, my peers have said it dozens of times, this frees up capital for them, hopefully for them to focus on that capital and more importantly their top merchandising resources on their best stores. As I think about and we look at, if each of them were to reduce their fleets by 35% or 40% or 50%, first of all very few if any of those stores would be in our portfolio because of the quality of the portfolio that we have. But secondly, if it's good for them, its good us.","We're in a middle of a significant rationalization in the retail industry, this is good for the haves, it's bad for the have nots. It\u2019s an environment where the richer are going to get richer, the poor is going to get poorer, that's luck. I am absolutely convinced that the top 20% or so of the malls and I could say the top 50%, but let's a safe number that hopefully most people wouldn\u2019t believe is arguable, say 20%, they have a place in future. That\u2019s exactly where over 90% of our EBITDA comes from.","Can you imagine for a minute that the anxieties the public investments had over the disruption that they think is happening with Amazon and ecommerce, can you imagine that resulting in major retail stores on 5th Avenue in New York or Michigan Avenue in Chicago or any other great High Street going away. I mean if that happens -- look the world is a different place, and if that happens we're all going to have to think about a complete recycling. I'll even take another step and tell you in that environment I would like to have tremendous real estate and that\u2019s what we have. And that\u2019s what we have. We have real estate that has the densest population within the short trade area of any of our peers and certainly well positioned and they are in gateway cities.","So we are well positioned for anything that comes over way and believe it or not we are optimistic.","With that I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And we will take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks for the information and outlook for San Francisco, I am wondering about the other two projects in the Seattle pipeline, Paradise Valley and Westside Pavilion. Is this -- there is a continues place on the Seattle pipeline, does that having to do with still you're trying to figure out what you want to do, or are you just waiting for a more opportune time to proceed with those redevelopments?","Art Coppola","Clearly on Westside Pavilion we are weighting three or four significant ideas, we need to get possession of one of the anchor locations there to proceed on any one of the three or four. We are -- and they really -- they go 180 degrees on the spectrum. There is one ideas that's all retail, there is another idea that has no retail, and there is another idea that has some retail and some other use, and you can tell I'm being careful about talking about what that other use is.","At the end of the day, it kind of fits into that bucket that I talked about, the Armageddon Bucket, where let's just say the whole world comes to an end for retail, okay that\u2019s fine. If that happens I want to own some great real estate. That real estate will be more valuable on a cost adjusted basis, I am including any capital of store [ph] into it, when it gets redeveloped I would bet anything, it will be more valuable than it was at a cadence as a retail project.","Paradise Valley, that's around the year, it's a great real estate, it's under performance in the shops, it's really bizarre because the department stores rank kind of in the middle of the -- in any one of those -- you know they have six department stores there, six anchors, which tells you that anchors are not necessarily a proxy for success. And the anchors, some of them got like number three or number four store out of eight or 10 stores in the market at that center. But the specialty stores can't get arrested. So there is a situation where we kind of hostage to getting back position from one or two of the department stores, so that we can start the phasing.","My guess is we're not going to be the one to actually do that project, because it's not that compelling, but it's fundamentally great real estate, the highest wealth of zip code in Arizona and maybe even the South West. But we need to get back a box or two in order to move forward and we are hostage, we can't get them back. We can't them back from the department stores.","Craig Schmidt","Great and then maybe just an update on the Heritage JV?","Art Coppola","Well, just to remind, that is a Joint Venture between us and Heritage in nine Sears stores and nine parking lots at nine of our malls. To date I don\u2019t know -- what kind of update would you like to hear?","Craig Schmidt","I just wanted to know are you going forward with picking over 100% of that space or are you still looking to do 50-50?","Art Coppola","I never was looking to do 50% recaptures from any of the Sears stores. It was done in the early phases and I think it was a great move to put Primark in the half or so of the Sears box at Danbury and Freehold and that\u2019s fine, that was a good idea. But honestly, I don\u2019t see the economics makes sense to recapture 50% getting at the other seven locations and effectively pace Sears to them, shrink into the other half of the space. Because A, it costs too much money to do it and B, ultimately you're kicking the can down the road. So if and when Sears does fail, that the opportunity to redeploy the other half, probably doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. So at this point in time, I really don\u2019t see anything happening on the development front of any of the other seven boxes.","Operator","Our next question will come from West Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","West Golladay","Looking at your center you mentioned the dead man walking, probably the low productive tenants 200 to 300 a foot. Can you talk about the demand you have waiting to get into the center? Is it enough to reform all these low-quality tenants that are just there because you have a lease with them?","Robert Perlmutter","This is Robert Perlmutter, obviously the leasing of these spaces is not different from the leasing of any of the spaces in the center. To the extent that there is a stronger productivity models, there is going to be more demand in the lower productivity models there is going to be less demand. I think the real key on the lower productivity centers is really changing the nature of who you are going to re-lease the space to.","Many of these tenants were built on a model that the more stores you had the more productivity you had and they intended to be two 2,500 to 4,000 foot tenants who really traded off of the foot traffic at the mall, trade off of them. And what we are seeing on the lower tier centers is often the best opportunities to aggregate this space up and look more at box uses or uses that were typically outside the mall as opposed to inside the mall.","So again, it\u2019s a higher productivity center the demand is good, whether the tenant went bankrupt or the tenant wasn\u2019t renewed at expiration, it really doesn\u2019t change the discussion. At the lower tier centers I think you will see a change in the nature of the tenant and it will be a larger format, more discount oriented tenants.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","Maybe a first question maybe a little bit of two part or I guess -- alright I was just curious, if Sears is thrown out there that they might look to dispose of another tranche of stores, I am curious, is there other opportunities for Macerich to explore transactions of anchors or do you think you're done with that at this point? And I guess maybe related to that, on the acquisition front, are there other deals that might be in the market place that you think would reveal pricing for better than A quality malls?","Art Coppola","The Sears stores that were offered for sale recently, none of them were in our malls, so we wouldn\u2019t be interest in any of those. As far as any opportunity to acquire department stores from department store operators, there are a number of department stores that I would love to get back from, I can name in my head one, two, three, four, five different names, there are five different names that each of them had at least one department stores I would love to get back from them and we're at various stages of conversation around that.","As one of my peers said yesterday, the opportunity to make a lot of money on taking not only the square footage but the land that these departments stores were given 30 years go to help create these malls and to repurpose that land into today's use and they help us really position these centers for the 21st century. It\u2019s a huge opportunity especially when you\u2019re in high population trade areas in gateway cities.","As far as on the acquisition front, I think I mentioned and we've even talked about it, alluded to it earlier. One of the reasons the private market values are still so strong is that the great malls and retail location that are out there are in the hands of strong people, who just have no interest in selling them and yes the demand to invest into those malls, either buy them or to joint venture them, just keeps growing as the capital -- sources of capital of the world, we get more educated about the space, look we were really lucky last year to buy a Country Club Plaza with Tom [ph] and organization which is going great, but I don\u2019t see any acquisition opportunities for us in the near-term, having said that every time I say that sometimes Eddy surprises me, but I don\u2019t see it. ","Jeff Donnelly","And just one other question on, just curious on your view on tenant improvements, if pressures on -- and maybe none of your malls or maybe just all malls, but if pressures on sort of unit level store profitability are accelerating and ultimately shortening the life cycle of some retailers or increasing tenant turnover. Is it fair to say that in the mall industry we\u2019re going to agree to expect landlord, they're going to have to chip in more dollars more frequently for TIs going forward? Do you think that's going to be one of the big shift if you will in the mall space?","Art Coppola","I'm not sure that\u2019s it's going to be a huge shift, but I think clearly capital is part of the discussion. As you know, in our business its very rare that on renewals tenant will receive any tenant allowance or concessions from the landlord especially at the better centers. So you really talking about capturing new tenants and I think as you see either tenants earlier in their development stage of their store fleets or tenants only looking for the prime locations or the nature bringing in more food and other non-traditional usage into the center. I think it's likely that the capital structure could be different. The rent would hopefully reflect that difference, but I don\u2019t think there is going to be a significant change in our tenant improvement cost and I don\u2019t think financial show us significant changes.","Robert Perlmutter","And that was happened, Jeff over the last couple of years it's trended down. Last year 2016 was lower than 2015 and year-to-date we're trending lower than 2016 was so. In actuality we're funding less in term of tenant allowance then we have in prior years. ","Art Coppola","And have been said that Jeff, I have to add that there in one area where tenant allowance will go up, and that\u2019s not the defensive area, that is in the offensive area. As I have gotten to know a lot of these digitally native in retailers or the company has gotten to know them, it's clear to me that when their ready to fund their estate rollouts, they're funding those rollouts with equity capital from venture capital firms is really a terribly expensive way for them to fund their rollouts.","So we have talked to some of these digitally native retailers. I said look, we'll help you with some of your build out, give you a little bit more than we normally would give to a tenant, in return for that we want a share in the reward to the extent that you do well. So as we embrace more and more kind of startups digitally native types of retailers, we are going to offer them more tenant allowance than normal to bring them end of the center, but we're also going to get paid for it in the way of a variable rent structure.","Operator","And our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Continuing on the investment team, if we can just go back to the write-off you mentioned two steps, you mentioned one, 10 million that you wrote-off, then you also mentioned that there are eight investments for 18 million. So I am guessing that the 10 was incremental to the 18. But if we could --.","Art Coppola","No, 18 was the total, 10 was part of that, so you could think of that we have 8 million invested in another eight ideas.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then can you --.","Art Coppola","Don\u2019t always assume the worst Alexander.","Alexander Goldfarb","We never do, in retail end we never assume the worst. So then a question -- I mean small investment mature, but just can you give a sense for sort of $1 million in a venture like, how that helps the venture and then what sort of opportunities are these? Are they operating businesses, are they just few folks at coffee shops trying to make something and go with it, if you could just give us a little bit favor?","Art Coppola","I mean these are early stage Series B type of investments. So and it's usually with a digitally native retailer who has big aspirations to establish a brick and motor platform on a national scale. And we're looking to find these people like somewhere after they've opened their first store, but before they opened their 20th stores. So we are taking positions in not only the enterprise, but also becoming a distribution channel for them. So that we can help them and nurture as they grow their idea. We are very selective in what we are doing there, we have only done a couple of those but we are going to do more.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then going to Craig's question, because you were -- you opened a little bit on Westside Pavilion, and number of months there was article that the Macy's box was purchased by a third party, so when you were talking about the need to acquire a box; one, does it involves that\u2019s, and two how does it work, if it doesn\u2019t involve that, how does it work when you want to do a redevelopment, someone else owns part of that project, how does it work for maximizing the value?","Art Coppola","It doesn\u2019t have any impact due the fact a third party bought the Macy's box. We had the opportunity to buy the Macy's box also, we just didn\u2019t -- we had a plan for what we wanted to do and we didn\u2019t need the Macy's box to implement that plan. I think whatever they do with the with the Macy's box will be a net positive for the property, I've heard them talk about, I've heard it talked about residential, which I am not sure maybe they will do that, but I think the more likely idea is creating office which will bring a lot of bodies and a lot of life, and for creative office the rents in that part of the world are extremely high.","We are waiting to -- we need to recapture the Nordstrom box and Nordstrom, as soon as we do that which we have the right to do that, I'm sure it will happen in month's not years, then we'll be able to be more transparent about what we're going to do with the property. But we're also -- we're still debating it, we're still debating all retail, none retail, some retail and some of something else. All three options are good options.","Operator","We will move to our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Tom I actually wanted to go back to the guidance for a second here, so through some benefit from the share [ph] buyback so far, no more dispositions contemplated, but presumably they are low share buybacks as well contemplated going forward. But I guess with the other parts of guidance being held constant, is that just because now you are waiting to see how the rest of Q2 shakes out. It sounds like you have visibility on two additional bankruptcies but is there a concern that there might be much more than that or are the discussions you are having suggesting that there is couple of more in the bubble there?","Tom O'Hern","Vin, obviously as you listen to Bobby section today, there were headwinds in -- I think it would be a little premature to start bumping guidance up at this point. So we'll see how the second quarter goes, we'll see how the leasing efforts going in the second quarter and then we'll take a look at that. As I said there is roughly 3%, excuse me $0.03 accretion from the buyback which happened in March, there was no effect of that that really hit in the first quarter. And we will take a look at how things look in total, not just that aspect, how the leasing is going, how we have absorbed some of the space we've gotten back from bankruptcies, and then we'll address the range again at that time.","Art Coppola","And Vincent just to add to that, since I'm feeling contrarian today with my partners. Knowing the couple of the names that Bobby was referring to, even if they hit the wall, I just can't imagine that's going to cause a change in our guidance.","Vincent Chao","I really appreciate the color that you gave on the bankruptcies that you've had so far in terms of the staff, the portfolio stuff if you will with lower productivity. I guess every mall good or bad has some proportion of that lower productivity tenant. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of the annualized coming from those lowest quality attempts maybe in that 250 or lower level outside of the bankrupt ones?","Art Coppola","It\u2019s a small number, I'll answer it for you. My guess is it's between 10% and 15%, and I'll tell you how I got there. So if I am wrong you'll at least see -- you'll know how I got there. I think a third of our tenants do well below our mall averages, they do around say 300 bucks a foot. I know that the rents those guys pay are not commensurate with what we get on average from the portfolio. They tend to be significantly below the average, close to half of the average. And they are already in generally lousy locations.","Look people don\u2019t just all of a sudden go from be in $1000 a foot tenant to $200 a foot over night, they kind of start their life being lousy, but you give them some space anyway, and you tend to give stuff on the ten-yard line. So those rents are probably significantly below the average rent, if I had to -- if you just put a gun to my head and said, alright if every one of those 30% of the tenants that do well below your mall average, by the way, our malls are the same as everybody else's malls. What hit the wall, what would be the impact, if they all hit the wall the same day on income, I don\u2019t know 10%, 15%, but I'd love to have them all back. I wouldn\u2019t want them all the same day with same day, but I would love to have the mall back and we're not going to get them back anyway at the same day, so it doesn\u2019t matter.","Operator","Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Todd Thomas","Art, back to the technology investment I guess, most of the other investments as you mentioned are about a $1 million and this one was $10 million. You mentioned as a company then you wrote down was a facilitator for some digitally native retailers and clearly you have the platform and the ability to bring those retailers to your malls which we've seem. So what was it that this company was doing specifically was it helping you seek out these retailers or something in terms of the fit out of the space or something else and does the failure of this company or platform cause any sort of problems or delay in sort of the roll out for some of these digital native retailers.","Art Coppola","No, it doesn\u2019t delay. Actually, it expedites them coming to us. It's my mistake, it's my bad. I made the investment. At the time it just sounded like great idea, they were taking retailers that didn\u2019t want to have a nexus in a state for example and they were even offering to staff the stores. So the retailer would essentially open a store through a store that this company would lease for us, and this company would even put employees on the floor, they would put smart mirrors into the location. It was the store of the future that they were talking about.","And it kind of sounded good, like many failed concepts, ICFC gave them store of the year award a couple of years ago. Its seems to be like the sports illustrated kiss of death. Look I made a mistake; I shouldn\u2019t have put that much money into one idea. If it would have worked, it would have been massive, the upside. It didn\u2019t work, that was a bad business plan and I concluded that the idea of trying to accelerate that process, which was what attracted us mainly to the idea, was that, you could literally potentially have several hundred new stores get attracted to your portfolio through this intermediary.","While that idea, that\u2019s a pretty nice idea and that idea of investing 10 million into somebody, taking a chance, taking a risk that it would work was appealing, the risk reward looked to be fine. Look the risk was 10 million. I don\u2019t think I'll be making that big a debt again, but the reward was massive had it worked.","Todd Thomas","Okay got it that\u2019s helpful and then just stepping back a bit, I guess as we think about the mall business, high quality shopping centers, Tesla sort of came out of nowhere, Apple change the landscape of retailer earlier [technical difficulty]. I am sure if there is sort of anyone one thing out there right now that you are looking at, but when you sort of thing about the business today, what is it that we could be missing, that could sort of change landscape going forward from here? Is it food and entertainment, is there a new concept or category, is it the online only retailers? What you think looks much different or really changes things up over the next couple of years?","Robert Perlmutter","This is Robert Perlmutter. I\u2019ll start the answer, I think there is a number of categories and I'll put it under the umbrella of how people lives their life. So we see increasingly interest from, whether it's health clubs or Soul Cycles, or that type of tenant or DryBar [ph], where the customer is has a certain lifestyle that isn\u2019t just buying apparel or shoes or accessories. So more and more we see, these retailers are seeking out the mall because of the footsteps and the amenities and more and more we see traditional mall retailers reacting really positively when you tell them you did a deal with Soul Cycle or you have a deal to DryBar because increasingly it means there is more touches with their customer and that\u2019s what they are really looking for.","So I think you are going to see a broadening of uses and I think it's going to be more reflective of the customer's lifestyle. So we were talking about this in terms of marketing. Historically, the opportunity was to use marketing to drive people to shop at the center, and these centers really have to evolve into venues that meet to customer's lifestyle and that\u2019s where I think in particular the identification and the use of mix users is important.","Art Coppola","Another thing I\u2019ll just add to that is that, I guess not that long from now, I\u2019ll be able to say, over the past tens of years, but I didn\u2019t say over the last 41 years, I can guaranty you that nothing has changed. This is a Darwinian business. The healthy get healthier and the weak die. Just look at every one of our tenant rosters from 20 years ago only two or three of our Top 10 tenants that were here 20 years ago are still in business, and the names that are our best tenants today didn\u2019t even exist 10 or 15 years ago, that\u2019s been the way of the world, at great retail locations, so it's a history of the bazaars 2,000 years ago. I am sorry, it's true.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christine McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.","Christine McElroy","Just a follow up on Vin's question, just to get a better sense for exactly what's in guidance, currently Bob, you talked about the nine retailers with the 69 locations plus there is another two retailers you talked about that might file, how much of that space do you expect to get back this year within your guidance? And of that space how much of that will be negotiated lease termination versus space, rejected their bankruptcy? And then sort of related to that, how do you think about rental lease today versus sort of closings in this environment?","Tom O'Hern","So Christine, I\u2019ll hit the first part of that, on lease term fees, that\u2019s a negotiation, it's always an uncertainty, in the assumptions and the guidance. We've got 15 million in the numbers for the year and that\u2019s our assumption on average of last six years, we've averaged about 12 million. And it's hard to say at this point in the year if it's going to be too light a number. But it certainly could be depending on some of these negotiations go and its always a choice and whether you add some bankruptcy just the threat of bankruptcy you can either negotiate for at least termination fee or you stay with the tenant and you got rent coming in and occupancy.","Art Coppola","And I think in terms of likely scenarios I think we probably have one situation that\u2019s going to generate termination fees and one situation that\u2019s probably going to be restructure with some store closing, so some impact, but not complete liquidation. In terms of how do we approach rent relief, I would say we approach it very stubbornly.","We believe that our assets are strong assets, we believe that rent relief whether it's a bankruptcy or through a negotiated settlement is an investment in these companies, we're investing our capital on these companies. And candidly, there is not a huge list of tenants who have successfully gone through a bankruptcy restructuring and become strong buyable tenants in the future.","So I would say we believe in our real estate, we approach rent relief very stubbornly. We do recognize that it may impact our short-term metrics which I mentioned before. But at the end of the day we are trying to make the right decision long term for these assets and if we don\u2019t, if the retailer can't sale us on making an investment in their business, we are not likely to do it.","Christine McElroy","Okay and then secondly with the share buyback in Q1, it was tied to the asset sales you've done year-to-date, and how you are thinking about doing further buybacks at this point? Would it only be with further asset sales or are you open to doing opportunistic buybacks in the current market?","Art Coppola","No, we have said before, but I'll say again, and maybe I haven\u2019t said it to you all, I've clearly said it in my board room, we'll match fund those. It won't be perfect, but we'll match fund it, the way we see it we are selling out of non-core asset at a fair price to buy shares in the remaining tremendous pool of assets at a significant discount to a fair price. We'll match fund it. It won't be perfect timing on the match funding, but we will match fund it. Was that the question?","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","So first just wondering can you talk a little bit about what's being going all with the occupancy at [indiscernible] and then secondly on the redevelopment pipeline, once you go beyond what's disclosed in the stuff, can you talk about how deep that is?","Art Coppola","Bob will talk about [indiscernible] and then I'll talk about the pipeline.","Rob Perlmutter","Michael I assume you are telling about the increase in [indiscernible] right?","Michael Mueller","Yes.","Robert Perlmutter","We actually had a couple of moves that were made at the center and let me start with the comment that it\u2019s a small center, so it look smaller amount of square footage has a pretty big impact. But we actually had a two-level store that was occupied by Banana Republic and we moved them out of that store into a smaller store, and we actually released the majority of their own store which was primarily second floor space and a little on the ground to [indiscernible] swaps. So that improved the occupancy and then also Apple expanded at the center. So those are the primary changes. It's really been some moving about.","Art Coppola","And then on the development pipeline, we sit down with our developers every -- periodically and we go over, all of the good ideas that we have. Now a lot of good ideas are a little futuristic, some of them are great ideas, but you have to wait for an event to happen, like getting back the department stores. And some are just ideas that you think are terrific, but they are just not ready for prime time because you have to get some zoning or whatever.","And when we sit down in those rooms and we look at the different ideas, I'm not going to -- this is not an attendance [ph] of our shadow pipeline or our supplement. But just quickly in my head while I was listening to Bobby answer I came up with a little over 2 billion assets that I would green light tomorrow if everything was ready to go.","Michael Mueller","Okay.","Art Coppola","The opportunities are tremendous this is the great future of great malls in highly in dense populated areas in gateways to these. And a big driver of that future is going to be combination of the recap or some space from department's stores, but it's also going to be the arrival of autonomous vehicles, so that we can adjust our parking rations to a more reasonable number and intensify the properties.","Michael Mueller","Okay and that 2 billion, that\u2019s all redevelopment of existing centers that\u2019s not new group up right?","Art Coppola","I got one ground up outlook property and it's not listed anywhere. It's not a real number; I said I did it in my head, it's easily 2 billion, please don\u2019t tie a timing to it.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Nick Yulico","Just want to ask you sort of latest thoughts on apparel exposure of malls and if I looked at -- I see as you give stats of 55% of mall GLA is apparel, I'm sure yours is lower than that, I think you've worked to reduce some of that mix in your malls. But the question I think is whether you and the industry can bring in enough tenants they aren\u2019t apparels to replace that square footage if apparel continues to shrink on in line space.","And whether these tenants in other industries are paying similarly higher rents as the apparels retailers leave that space. I know furniture stores is talked about as growing demand, they take a lot of space the question is do they pays as much rent as the apparel tenants are leaving?","Art Coppola","So when you will hear that, that\u2019s a good question, so when you hear that 55% number what you think that applies to, do you think it applies to our malls space or you think it applies to the entire shopping mall, including the departments stores?","Nick Yulico","That\u2019s specifically just non-anchor inline space. ","Art Coppola","That\u2019s a baloney number, it's so false it's unbelievable. Never was true, never close to being true. I think the highest, Bobby -- I think 20 years ago maybe apparel was close to 40%, but today its well under 30% in our portfolio in terms of in line space, am I wrong about that?","Robert Perlmutter","I don\u2019t know the exact number, it's also how are they defining apparel, are they defining as apparel, accessory shoes, where it's in their product category. [Multiple Speakers].","Nick Yulico","I guess the question is still, if apparel needs to shrink in the mall and other tenants need to take that place, do the other tenants coming in, are they able to pay the same rent as apparel?","Art Coppola","Since nobody will believe my predictions, all I can do is look at history. History would tell you that 10 years ago the following names didn\u2019t have a lot of square footage and today they are some of our best tenants at our mall, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, countless numbers of restaurants that we have that draw traffic, great names. And that will be the way of the future.","It all -- let's do remember, I know you all think of us as a mall company, but we are a real estate company. And so even if the mall business model changes, if you have fundamentally great real estate, it will be occupied and it will be healthy and it will be vibrant.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to today's presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Thank you. I just would like to say that six months ago I think on one of the earnings call, I made a big point of saying I feel your pain, and I don\u2019t want any of my remarks today to indicate that I am not emphatic. But I am done feeling your pain.","Look our view of the future is very positive, we are in rough waters, we see a significant disruption between not only our view, but some very smart global private investors of the fundamental underlying value of our business and the value of our real estate compared to the way the public markets have seen the values and to some degree we have taken advantage of that.","So I thank you for your participation and we look forward to communicating with you over the balance of this year. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation you may now disconnect. "],"13970":["Macerich Co.

And welcome to the Macerich Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference. Today's conference is being recorded. Additionally, today's call will be limited to one hour.","At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jean?","Jean Wood","Thank you, Lori. Thank you all for joining us on our first quarter 2019 earnings call.","During the course of this call, we will be making certain statements that may be deemed forward looking within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC and posted in the Investor section of the company's website at macerich.com.","Joining us today are Tom O\u2019Hern, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Kingsmore, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Kingsmore","Thank you, Jean.","The first quarter reflected good operating results. Sales productivity and leasing activity remained strong, and we experienced healthy year-over-year occupancy increases, all of which Doug will elaborate on, later during the call. As we expected, there were numerous bankruptcy filings within the first few months of 2019, which was factored into the guidance we issued three months ago.","Here are some highlights for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.81, which beat our guidance and consensus estimates by $0.01. Same-center growth in net operating income was 1.7% for the quarter, which does exceed our 0.5% to 1% same-center NOI guidance for 2019. Margins continued to show improvements. The EBITDA margin for the quarter improved by 140 basis points to 61.7%, up from 60.3% for Q1 2018. REIT, G&A and management company expenses collectively showed $17 million of reduction during the quarter. This resulted primarily from nearly $13 million of onetime severance costs incurred in Q1 '18 from the reduction in force we undertook in early 2018. In addition, we realized recurring comparative savings and compensation costs from that reduction in force and also from reductions in executive compensation.","Savings in corporate overhead were offset by various line items, including primarily the following. One, a $6 million increase in interest expense versus Q1 2018. As a side note, this excludes the non-FFO impacts of the accounting pronouncement on Chandler Freehold. This $6 million was driven by both interest rate increases as well as by increased interest expense on long-term fixed-rate financings. Two, a $5.2 million increase in leasing expenses versus Q1 2018, which was driven primarily by the new lease accounting standard. Three, a decrease in noncash revenue from straight-lining of rent and SFAS 141 of $2 million versus the first quarter of '18. And lastly, a decrease in lease termination revenue of a little over $2 million versus Q1 '18, which we know can be very lumpy in nature.","With respect to 2019 earnings guidance, at this time, we're reaffirming our guidance for both FFO per share diluted and for same-center net operating income, and we direct you to the company's Form 8-K supplemental financial information for more details on the company's guidance assumptions.","Regarding our financing activity, the following summarizes the current status of our 2019 plans.","In January, as we previously mentioned to you, we did close on a $300 million, 12-year, fixed-rate financing on Fashion Outlets of Chicago at a fixed rate of 4.58%. This transaction yielded $100 million of incremental proceeds, which were used to repay a portion of the company's revolving line of credit.","We have entered into a commitment for a $220 million, 10-year, fixed-rate financing on SanTan Village in Gilbert, Arizona, at the fixed rate of 4.3%. That transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and is expected to generate approximately $84 million of incremental liquidity and Macerich's share.","We plan to soon enter into a commitment for a $256 million, 5-year, fixed-rate financing on Chandler Fashion Center in Chandler, Arizona, with an expectation to lock rate at 4.1% approximately and a late second quarter closing.","Our joint venture in One Westside is currently sourcing construction financing proposals, which are expected to fully finance ownership's remaining incremental cost to deliver the redevelopment of this creative office campus to Google.","We are in market now to source financing opportunities on the recently developed office and residential components of Tysons Corner, both of which are currently unencumbered. And then lastly, as we previously mentioned to you, by year-end, we anticipate a very significant refinance of Kings Plaza, our recently redeveloped, market-dominant, Class A regional center in Brooklyn.","Collectively, this set of financings are anticipated to generate approximately $600 million of liquidity to the company.","Now, I will turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment.","Doug Healey","Thanks, Scott.","In the first quarter, sales and occupancy remained strong and leasing velocity continued. Portfolio sales ended the first quarter at $746 per square foot, which represented an 8.7% increase on a year-over-year basis. Economic sales per square foot, which are weighted based on NOI, were $869 per square foot, and that's up 8.6% from $800 per square foot a year ago. Quarter-end occupancy was 94.7%. This represents a 70 basis point increase versus a year ago and a 70 basis point decline as compared to year-end 2018 occupancy of 95.4%. This decline is due to typical seasonality in the business between Q4 and Q1 as well as a store closures from the early 2019 bankruptcies.","Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 11%, which is consistent with 11.1% at year-end 2018.","Average rent for the portfolio was $60.74 per square foot, and that's up 3.9% from $58.44 per square foot 1 year ago.","Leasing volumes were extremely strong in the first quarter. During the quarter, 258 leases were executed for a total of 825,000 square feet. This represents 64% more leases and 51% more square feet compared to the same centers in first quarter 2018.","The large-format space remains active. We signed 2 leases with Round One, 1 at Fashion District of Philadelphia and 1 at Deptford Mall. In addition, we signed a 2-level, 23,000 square foot H&M at The Oaks as well as ULTA and Ross at Superstition Springs. We also executed multiple deals with emerging brands, including Peloton at The Oaks and in Washington Square, Casper at Tysons Corner and Washington Square, UNTUCKit at The Village at Corte Madera, Indochino at Santa Monica Place, Morphe at Tysons Corner and Ring at Scottsdale Fashion Square.","Other notable leases signed in the first quarter include our second deal with Industrious and 33,000 square feet of second-level space at Broadway Plaza; Hollister at Fashion District of Philadelphia; Sandbox, a virtual-reality concept at Cerritos; Pedals & Pints, a local craft brewery at The Oaks; and Altar'd State at Washington Square. In addition, we opened 37 new tenants in the first quarter which totaled 130,000 square feet.","We're especially pleased with the opening of our first coworking unit, Industrious, at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Industrious built a stunning space and has already exceeded 90% occupancy within the first few months of opening, which is well ahead of their plan. We feel their users will be a perfect fit for Scottsdale and definitely accretive to Scottsdale's already powerful shopper base. Other exciting openings include 2 ALEX AND ANI stores at Cerritos and Santa Monica Place; EQ3, a Winnipeg-based furniture store at North Bridge; a flagship Lululemon and new Gucci store at Scottsdale along with Bonobos at 29th Street.","Looking at our industry and leasing in particular, even with the recently announced closures from early 2019 bankruptcies, we remain bullish on retail in both the Class A mall sector and in bricks-and-mortar stores. We recognize the first quarter had its share of store closure announcements. But we also recognize those announcing store closures had several things in common: one, their balance sheets were overleveraged, preventing them from reinvesting in their brand and their business in order to keep them relevant; two, there's no focus on customer service; and three, there's no focus on providing any kind of in-store experience. So as a result, these retailers became obsolete.","We do believe it's noteworthy that 407,000 square feet of the 2019 bankruptcies within our portfolio, 85% of that volume is concentrated within only 4 brands. These brands have long struggled. Most have previously filed bankruptcy and now find themselves without choices other than to close all or a majority of their store fleet. And this isn't a revelation to us or to the industry. So again, we weren't surprised by these closures and in fact anticipated most of them as most have been on our watch list for years.","Unlike the media, we prefer to focus on the positive things happening in our industry, the things you don't readily read about or hear about. For example, Apple, Lululemon, VF Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle and many other retailers continue to reinvent themselves and are thriving. In fact, American Eagle is opening 30 to 40 new stand-alone Aerie stores this year. Abercrombie & Fitch is once again opening kids stores.","The luxury and cosmetic categories remained strong, led by LOUIS VUITTON, Gucci, Sephora and ULTA Cosmetics. Entertainment, food and beverage and coworking are on fire. JD Sports out of London recently bought a Finish Line and is aggressively looking to open stores, both in malls and on high streets. Levi Strauss had a very successful IPO in March and is now actively looking to open stores. And it's my understanding that a few more retailers may go public by the end of the year.","So, these are just a few of the examples of the positive things that are happening in the industry, and we look forward to capitalizing on these opportunities and many others as they continue to present themselves in the future.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Doug.","We had a very solid first quarter with good operating metrics, including FFO at $0.81 per share, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Same-center NOI growth was 1.7%. Portfolio productivity continued to improve with the portfolio now performing at $746 per foot, up 8% from a year ago, and occupancy was nearly 95%, also up significantly from a year ago.","As you could tell from Doug's comments on the leasing environment, it's very strong. It's as strong as it's been in years. We had very high leasing volumes in the first quarter, up over 50% compared to the first quarter of last year. And the tenant quality keeps improving as we replace stale, underperforming, small-format apparel tenants with entertainment, dining, lifestyle and fitness uses as well as online retailers expanding their business into brick-and-mortar locations. Our redevelopment pipeline continues to progress well, including our prospects for the replacement of the Sears stores that have now closed. We are very excited about the progress at redevelopments at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Fashion District of Philadelphia, One Westside and Los Angeles Premium Outlets. The opportunity to capture and replace unproductive department store boxes within our great malls provides us with a unique generational opportunity to elevate the value, productivity and attractiveness of our better-quality real estate.","Our recent replacement of Sears at Kings Plaza with Primark, Zara, JCPenney and Burlington as well as the replacement of Barney's at Scottsdale Fashion Square with Apple and Industrious are 2 prime examples of significantly enhancing the productivity and traffic compared to underperforming department store boxes.","Looking specifically at our redevelopment pipeline. At Scottsdale, the development continues on the 80,000 square foot exterior expansion, which is now 100% leased and includes a tremendous collection of high-end and lifestyle restaurants including Nobu, Ocean 44, Farmhouse as well as an Equinox fitness club. The majority of the restaurants will open by holiday 2019; Equinox will open in spring of 2021.","Within the former Barney's location, Apple and Industrious are now open. Industrious opened in January to a company-best 75% opening day occupancy, and they are now well ahead of plan with an occupancy level of over 90%. These 2 tenants have significantly elevated consumer traffic and productivity within this formerly challenged wing that was anchored by an underperforming department store, which in turn has generated leases with, among others, a flagship Lululemon, Peloton, UNTUCKit, L'Occitane and Capital One Caf\u00e9. This is exactly the type of follow-on leasing energy we anticipated while we replace a department store box with a high-quality tenant.","The newly renovated and re-tenanted luxury wing will continue to add new stores throughout the year and includes an exciting lineup of new -- or newly renovated luxury retailers including Gucci, Prada, LOUIS VUITTON, Cartier, Breitling, Saint Laurent, Omega, Ferragamo, Jimmy Choo and more. Also, there's a deal signed for a new Caesars Republic hotel, which is scheduled to open in 2021.","Moving on to Fashion District of Philadelphia. Construction continues on this 4-level retail and entertainment hub that spans over 800,000 square feet in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. The project will provide the city with the most concentrated critical mass of retail, taking advantage of mass transit that feeds directly into the concourse level of the project. At this point, the shell building is essentially complete, and tenant construction is work is underway. We have signed leases or in active lease negotiation with tenants for over 85% of the leasable area. Noteworthy commitments include Century 21, Burlington, H&M, Nike, Forever 21, AMC Theatre, Round One and City Winery.","At One Westside, formally known as Westside Pavilion, along with our 75% partner, Hudson Pacific, who recently announced that we've signed a Google lease as the sole occupant that will become the tenant for 584,000 square feet of Class A creative office space. The joint venture expects to invest an incremental $360 million to $400 million at an 8% return. We anticipate that the venture will close on a loan facility, which will fully fund the remaining cost to be incurred on this project.","The Carson Reclamation Authority continues its horizontal site work to support the Los Angeles Premium Outlets. That's our 50-50 joint venture with the Simon Property Group. We expect to commence vertical construction of phase 1 totaling 400,000 square feet in early 2020 with a planned opening in fall 2021.","Now for an update on Sears. We had a total of 21 Sears stores broken into 3 different ownership groups. Group 1 is our 50-50 partnership with Seritage and includes 9 stores in some of our top centers. The average sales per foot in these centers is over $800 per foot, and it represents some of the best situated Sears parcels in our portfolio. Only 2 of the 9 stores are expected to remain open, at Danbury and Freehold, each of which have already been converted into a smaller-format Sears with the upper level of each box leased to Primark. Of the remaining 7 locations, we expect Arrowhead Towne Center to close within the coming months, and the other 6 locations are already closed. And at this time, we anticipate these 7 leases will be rejected in mid-May. We have very specific plans for the 7 locations where we expect to have leases rejected and will be discussing them in more detail once we have control of the stores.","Group 2 consist of 7 Sears locations that are owned by Macerich and are leased to Sears for a very nominal rent. Of those 7 stores, 4 are closed and 3 will remain open, including Green Acres, Stonewood and Victor Valley. We're actively exploring various alternatives for redeveloping those 4 locations and assume that those leases will also be rejected in mid-May. The third group consists of 5 Sears stores. 4 of those are owned by Seritage, 1 is owned by Sears. Of those 5 stores, 3 are closed, and Inland Center and Pacific View stores will remain open and are on the Sears going forward list.","So, in summary, of our 21 Sears locations, 7 will remain open, and we expect lease rejections on 11 locations. And we also expect the 3 stores owned by Sears and Seritage will remain closed. We anticipate in total spending $250 million to $300 million of incremental capital at this time to redevelop the Sears boxes. That could vary depending on the scope of these projects as well as the underlying ownership structure. The redevelopments are expected to be completed starting in 2020 and run through 2024.","So, in closing, I'd like to say the improved quality of our portfolio achieved through noncore asset dispositions, redevelopment and replacement of unproductive tenants with exciting new and diversified uses has positioned us well for the coming years. As we progress through 2019, we are very enthused about the continued progress on our redevelopment opportunities. While we continue to face some short-term occupancy disruption from several bankruptcies that occurred to start the year, we remain firm in our belief that in the long run, our high-quality assets situated in dense urban markets will thrive as the retail landscape continues to evolve.","Now, I will turn it over to the operator to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Samir Khanal.","Samir Khanal","Scott or Tom, it seems like after you provided guidance on the same-store front we had some resolution at Sears, right. So it sounded like they're going to be open a bit longer. And you did kind of the 1.7% in the quarter for same-store, but your guidance is still 75 base at the midpoint. Can you maybe walk us through kind of the swing factors or the plus and minus to get you to kind of the low end or the high end of guidance at this time?","Scott Kingsmore","Sure. Samir, I'll touch on a few of those points. The -- so we did anticipate that Sears -- within our guidance, that Sears would pay rent through January. We mentioned that 3 months ago. And in fact, they're going to stay open roughly a quarter extra. Bear in mind, though, that from a bottom line standpoint, once those projects, are placed into development, we'll be capitalizing interest on the basis. So the cash rent accretion that we would get from an extra quarter of rent from Sears will be offset by capitalized interest. So that factors into the FFO thinking. Also, bear in mind that the accretion from Sears that we would get from extra quarter is carved out of our same center. It is not included in same center. So that's one thing to note. And then I would just say just overall in terms of our guidance, when we came into the year, we anticipated that these bankruptcies would occur.","Again, as Doug mentioned, none of this was a surprise to us. What we didn't know at the time was exactly how the complexion of those bankruptcies would roll out. And in other words, while -- as we look a couple years ago where bankruptcies were somewhat of a mix between assumptions as is, assumptions with lease modifications and some closures, what we've now realized is that this year, of the 400,000 square feet or so that has now filed, roughly 85% of that volume has resulted in store closures and liquidations.","So what we are actively doing now is backfilling that space. And in fact, we backfilled approximately 55% of that space to date. But of that 55%, we're only replacing roughly 1\/3 of the rent that we had lost. So in a nutshell, we continue to backfill, but largely that's due to a temporary tenancy on a short-term basis, which, bear in mind, our temporary tenants pay roughly 1\/3 of the rent that a market rent-paying tenant would be on a long-term basis. So as we look at the year, yes, we started off the year well at 1.7%, but we still have a lot of work to do and we're going to wait to see how the year unfolds. And at this point in time, we do feel comfortable affirming our 0.5% to 1% same-center NOI growth.","Samir Khanal","And I guess just as a follow-up or just sort of switching gears here, I know, Tom, you talked about potentially doing a joint venture and using proceeds to lower leverage. But -- so it's probably a bit too early, but are you able to at least provide any color or any kind of early indications of pricing or interest at this point?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. Samir, it's a little early to conclude on that front. We are considering doing a joint venture, as we mentioned on the last call, and it would be -- they're 1 or 2 of our top 20 assets. So we think it would be earnings neutral, and we're evaluating that potential right now. It could end up raising between $500 million to $800 million of equity that we would plan to use to pay down debt.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Schmidt at Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Is your JV done with the entitlements and zoning efforts at the Los Angeles Premium Outlets?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes.","Craig Schmidt","Okay.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. It's concluded. And we're in the planning phases right now.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then just maybe if you could comment on the restaurant commitments or dining commitments at Fashion District at Philadelphia.","Doug Healey","We had commitments, Craig, from City Winery, Yard House. And then there's a cluster food court tenants, if you will. I will say, though, given the fact that we've announced AMC and that we recently announced Round One, 2 entertainment components, the interest from the restaurants has become much more significant. So probably more to report in the future.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb at Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Tom, just going back -- for my first question, going back to your comments on the JVs that you said that the -- whatever it was, $500 million to $800 million will be used for debt paydown. As we think about Sears, you guys are spending sort of gross $140 million to redo the Barney's so that the Sears -- the budget of $250 million to $300 million sounds like that will go up. But obviously, it's over time. So can you just walk through how you're thinking about funding all the Sears redevelopments? And then also, would you consider the dividend as a source of capital to help put more money and to help fund the Sears redevelopments?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Sure, Alex. So the Sears could take a variety of structures. To the extent we knocked down the Sears building and do multifamily, for example, we will most likely bring in a multifamily developer who would take a share of the project. So that -- the size of that capital commitment is fluid. It could change either direction. But in terms of funding it, we've got quite a bit of liquidity from refinancing, as Scott outlined, 5 or 6 deals near term where we're going to generate in excess of $600 million. So the concern is not liquidity. As we mentioned, we're considering doing a JV. That would reduce our leverage level. But liquidity is not the issue. Once those refinancings are done, our line of credit will be under $400 million. And it's a $2 billion line of credit, so there's a lot of capacity there. So our preference would be to do a joint venture. At this time, we're not considering any change to the dividend.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then on the guidance, and maybe it's just in the wording, but it looks like you guys are now expecting higher leasing impact, $0.24, for this year versus before it was $0.18. Maybe it's the wording, but it just looks like that element has gone up. So I don't know, maybe that's offset, because Sears is staying a quarter longer. So maybe the 2 net out, which is why guidance didn't change. But can you just walk through that?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes. Sure Alex. It really is wording. You'll note that the guidance still reflects that the year-over-year impact between '18 and '19 is still anticipated to be $23 million or $0.15. Our prior disclosures represented a leasing cost net of leasing commission income, and that was for both '18 and '19. As we rolled into the year and we started to disclose exactly what the first quarter would look like, we realized that it's probably more appropriate to show those leasing expenses at gross. And so that's why you see the change within the guidance footnotes. But just to be clear, there are no changes to our estimates of leasing expenses. It's simply a change to our guidance disclosures at this point.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Sullivan at BTIG.","Jim Sullivan","Couple of questions regarding the sales productivity number. There was a pretty impressive gain in the sales per foot, and I'm assuming that Tesla was a factor. Do you have the sales comp excluding the Tesla impact?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Jim, we don't have that, and we typically don't disclose something like that on a tenant by tenant basis. But obviously, Tesla has a positive impact. And we have 6 Teslas in our portfolio that report sales, and they're all in the top 10 group. So when you see some of the big increases that occurred in those top 10 tenants, you should look at our supplement, Page 14. And quite a few of those have a Tesla there. So that was a positive factor. Apple's a positive factor. But there are a lot of others in there as well.","Jim Sullivan","So just kind of a follow-up on the impacts of that. If Tesla and Apple are factors, should we assume that the revenue-to-sales ratio or the occupancy cost is likely to decline over time or stay a little bit lower than it has been over time, which was the case, I think, in the fourth quarter and again here in the first quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern","That's a factor, both of those tenants.","Operator","And moving next to Christy McElroy at Citi.","Christy McElroy","Appreciate you breaking out the bad debt line in the supplemental. I'm wondering, just because bad debt was up year-over-year, what impact that had on the same-store NOI growth. And then also, you had mentioned earlier in the call that there was some year-over-year margin improvement. I'm wondering the sort of -- how all these factors impacted same-store being above the full year range. I know that bad debt would have been an offset, but just the margin part.","Scott Kingsmore","Sure. Christy, this is Scott. Yes, bad debt was up, I believe, $700,000 quarter-over-quarter. That was really driven by pre-petition rent write-offs for the bankruptcies. That would have had a dilutive impact on same center. I'd estimate that at roughly 30 to 35 basis points of dilutive impact in the quarter. So certainly, that does factor in. We did talk about margins. We've specifically focused on EBITDA margins. So bad debts would certainly cut against that. Obviously, some of the savings in our reduction in force as well as our savings in executive compensation were also contributing factors to the increase in our EBITDA margins.","Christy McElroy","Okay. So, it's more corporate-level margins as opposed to property profit margins?","Scott Kingsmore","Our property margins did increase by, I want to say, 20 to 25 basis points. Our EBITDA margins had even greater growth given the overhead savings, correct.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then, just, it looks like the occupancy rate at Queens dropped quarter-over-quarter. What was behind that?","Scott Kingsmore","Sure. We had one large tenant that we are repositioning and downsizing. And so that was a reduction of, I think, roughly 20,000 square feet that caused that change in occupancy.","Operator","And we'll go next to the Linda Tsai at Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Tom, on the last call, you highlighted Macerich's SC NOI growth of 3.2% over the last 10 years. And currently, bankruptcies are weighing on that typical growth. Since you're reaffirming the 50 bps to 100 bps guidance for this year, what sort of growth would you expect in 2020? Closer to that of 2019 or closer to your historical range?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Linda, we're not quite ready to give guidance for next year, but let me speak to that directionally. When we came into this year, we said this was going to be a transitional year. We had visibility into Gymboree and Charlotte Russe, Things Remembered. And we expected that to weigh on the occupancy level and same-center growth for the year. But as we move through this year, based on what Doug is seeing in the leasing environment and what we're seeing throughout our portfolio, I think we're going to get back to more historical levels as we move into 2020 and beyond.","Linda Tsai","And then you've spoken about the Simon L.A. outlet project several times including today, but it's still not in the development schedule in the supplemental. Is that because it's too early to provide a preliminary development cost estimate?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. We're still refining the scope of the work there. And I would imagine that sometime within the next quarter or so, it will probably show up in the development pipeline report.","Operator","We'll take our next question today from Todd Thomas at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sir?","Todd Thomas","First question, just following up on Tesla. Tom, you said 6 report sales. How many Teslas do not report sales? And then I think you had at least one more lease signed or pending leases in the pipeline, including one, I believe, at Santa Monica Place. Just given Tesla's comments around stores more recently, I'm just curious if those are still moving forward and whether any have closed or are closing in the portfolio.","Tom O\u2019Hern","We have a total of 7 that are open today, Todd. So 6 of the 7 report sales. And then we have a lease signed right on 3rd Street as you enter Santa Monica Place. That was a recent signing, and we expect them to open in the fall. So at this point, they've got great locations in some of our best centers, and they're doing quite well. And to our knowledge, none of those are going to close. Is it possible we'll lose one? Yes, it's certainly possible, but I doubt any more than one.","Todd Thomas","Okay. And then I had a question on the food and restaurant as a category. We saw Kona Grill file this week. And I know there's been a big push to add more food in recent years. Can you just talk about the performance of that category over the last few years as the focus on foods increase? And can you comment specifically on turnover trends and CapEx and the economics of those deals in general?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. I mean there continues to be good demand. I mean the restaurant business is such that there's always going to be concepts that fail or get stale, Kona being no exception. But there's a lot of other exciting restaurants that we have available. They're expensive deals, but they typically are better than average return on cost. And you can see from the announcement on Scottsdale Fashion Square with Farmhouse, Ocean 44 and Nobu. Those are some great higher-end restaurants that should do quite well at Scottsdale Fashion Square. I would say, and jump in here, Doug, but it seems that there is more choice than we've ever had as it relates to the food and beverage category.","Doug Healey","Yes. That's true, Tom, and especially when it comes to the traditional mall restaurant sector. That's extremely right -- active right now. Cheesecake is doing deals. Darden is doing deals. BJ's brewhouse is opening up stories. Shake Shack clearly is opening up stores. True Food Kitchen, same. So as the Konas of the world go away because they've become somewhat irrelevant, I think there's still a nice pipeline to follow it up.","Todd Thomas","And can you comment on sales transfer for some of those that have -- that are in the portfolio, have been in the portfolio in the same-store or comp pool?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Most are trending up. A good example is Cheesecake Factory at Scottsdale Fashion Square on the third level. But their sales continue to go up every year. And I think that's a pretty good barometer for the rest of the category in our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question today is from Caitlin Burrows at Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","I have 2, call it, reporting questions. I guess first, on guidance. In the first quarter, you recognized the $6.3 million loss on sale or write-down of assets that impacted net income and EPS but then was offset in the FFO calculation, as expected. But then when I look at your FFO guidance page in the supplement, it doesn't show this offset in the full year number. So I was just wondering why that is. Is it just that you didn't revise the net income part this quarter or some other reasons?","Scott Kingsmore","Yes. Caitlin, you're correct. We just did not revise the net income portion. I mean that will get rolled in. Our focus primarily was on our FFO line item guidance. At this point, we just confirm that across the board. The impairments were nothing unusual, as you saw. In the first quarter of 2018, we had significant impairments as well, and GAAP requires us to periodically assess carrying value on a depreciable basis. It requires you to mark down that basis, but it certainly doesn't allow you to recognize appreciation basis. So that's just part of our routine quarterly closing, and I don't think there's anything unusual there.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Makes sense. And then second on the bad debt topic. The earnings release shows your income statement for 1Q '19 and reclassified various 1Q '18 amounts to correspond. But if I look at the 1Q '18 total revenues, it shows $236.7 million, which is the same as you did report in 1Q '18. So I'm just wondering if the bad debt piece was always inside of revenues. Or how does the reclassification happen but that 2018 number not change?","Scott Kingsmore","I'm very impressed by your question given that you only had a few hours to digest. So great job. Very good question. So the accounting literature provides that bad debt, whatever you want to call it, uncollectible accounts, they all have different nomenclature, effective January '19 will be treated as a contra revenue. But in 2018, it's still recognized as shopping center expense and is not a contra revenue. So there is a distinction between 2018 and 2019 reporting.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. So the total revenue shown in that table is not exactly like-for-like to the 2019 number\u2026","Scott Kingsmore","Correct, due to bad debt.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Donnelly at Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","Just a quick question. The average base rent that's in place at Macerich has been growing faster the last several years than the average base rent you've been signing. And the gap actually has been widening in favor of the in-place base rent, so I guess -- which kind of implies that your core growth has sort of held up even though initial rents might have not. I guess I'm just curious, I mean, we're all well aware of the challenges that are out there in the retail market. But as it relates to leasing, have you guys been able to hold on to rent bumps in the leases that you're signing? I'm just -- I guess that's really ultimately what my question is. What are you getting out of your retailers' intra-lease? Has that been fairly resilient?","Doug Healey","Jeff, it's Doug. Yes. The answer to that is yes. Regardless of any fallout as we replace and continue to renew, we maintain all of our increases internally.","Operator","Our next question today is from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Just two quick ones here. Tom, you commented about the potential JVs in the works as a means of raising capital. But any thoughts on additional outright sales? Is there anything there that you're considering?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. We went through a period of time where we sold noncore and we've whittle that number down. Just less than 5% of our total NOI is reflected on the insurance on Page 14 and 15 of the supplement. So we think we're good there. In terms of an outright sale, our preference is a JV. We also think, generally speaking, for A-quality malls there's a bigger pool of buyers for a JV interest than a whole -- 100% interest because then they've got to go out and find an operator typically. So we think there's pretty good demand, and that's frankly something we've done many times in our history. We did it in 2009. We did it in 2015 and 2016. So really, we're focused on the JV rather than an outright sale.","Jeremy Metz","And does that demand for an operating partner, therefore, help offset any change someone would pay for an outright purchase?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, I haven't done a lot of transactions, so it's a little tough to tell. We have seen some JVs done recently. We know there's good institutional demand there from domestic as well as sovereign funds. So I think we've seen more examples of joint ventures transacting than we have outright sales. And there's some fees involved. But generally, we do these deals 50-50 or 49-51, something like that, and we would expect that to be the case here.","Jeremy Metz","Got it. Second one from me. Of the 3 Seritage boxes that are owned and closed, are you in discussions with them to partner on the redevelopment or re-leasing of those? Or do you just have more than enough to deal with that at this point?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, those assets are of lower quality than the assets that are in the Seritage JV. So that's really where we're going to focus our initial attention. And it remains to be seen if there'll be more to discuss with them on the 3 boxes that they own and have closed. But really for us, the focus is where the biggest investment potential is, and that's on the 7 JV -- Seritage JV assets that we expect to be rejected here in the next month.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Yulico at Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. So it's -- actually, it's kind of a 2 part on the Sears redevelopment. First, Tom, regarding that 2020 and 2024 time frame you mentioned for the Sears redevelopments, is that based on waiting to start some of the redevelopments or just how long do you expect a potential construction to make. And is there any concern that if you wait to start some of the redevelopments, the empty anchor might be detrimental to mall performance?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, there's a couple of things there, Greg, and I mentioned it when I was talking about Sears. In some cases, we will demolish the Sears building, and we'll change the use. We envision a few of these where we would put a hotel or potentially multifamily. And that'll take some entitlement time, typically 18 months, something like that. So those are the projects that would be further out on the time line. In other cases where we're just going through a re-tenanting exercise, we could expect to get that done within 12 months. So that really is -- in terms of worried about Sears being closed, they haven't been a fantastic draw the last 10 years or so. Look at what we did at Kings Plaza and how much energy and traffic picked up as a result of replacing a Sears box with Zara and Primark and Burlington. And we'd expect that in most cases. So we don't think it's a big negative that there's a dark Sears box. But the prospects of redeveloping and adding different types of uses is really a generational opportunity for us and something we've been waiting for, for a while now.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And a follow-up. There's the change in the footnote that now talks about including consideration from your JV partners on a potential investment size for the Sears. Should we take that to mean Seritage may not be as willing to invest in transformative redevelopment opportunities, that you may have been alone, or how should we be thinking about that?","Tom O\u2019Hern","No. As we consider things like mixed-use, multifamily for example, we may bring in a partner, an additional partner that's got multifamily expertise.","Greg McGinniss","So, that wasn't necessarily a Seritage related comment, but a potential other JV partner?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Correct.","Operator","We'll move next to Ki Bin Kim at SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Going back to the sales per square foot commentary, are you able to provide like what the median sales per square foot trends have been and maybe which categories are doing better than others?","Tom O\u2019Hern","We don't put a median number out there in terms of the types of tenants. The categories that have been doing well, footwear's been doing well. Food and beverage has done well. They're probably the 2 main categories and the general category, of course, where you include Tesla and Apple has done very well.","Ki Bin Kim","So I guess from a trend-wide standpoint, is it far off from like the average reporting number, the median or just if the general direction is similar.","Tom O\u2019Hern","I don't have the median here in front of me. We can get back to you on that, Ki Bin.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just next question on Fashion District. You're about 4 months away from opening. 85% leased, If I do the math from the outside looking in, but I would imagine if you excluded some of the anchors that have been in place, the in-line leasing is probably lower, much lower than 85%. How has the progress for this center been compared to some other projects? And is there -- are you at all concerned about just the leasing trajectory?","Doug Healey","It's Doug. No. This project really has evolved over time. What once started out as a pure outlet play has changed, and I think there's a few reasons for that. One, we announced AMC, and that led to much more entertainment, much more food and beverage. A lot of these retailers that have been looking at Philadelphia for quite some time to do a flagship have found Market Street to be the place they want to be. So now we've got a couple of flagship stores opening up on Market Street. So between the theater, the entertainment, the outlet, the anchors, we've got a lot of traction. And that 85% number is a real number, and we look forward to the opening in September.","Operator","And next we'll go to Tayo Okusanya at Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","I'm trying to reconcile some of your comments about the retail outlook versus some of your peers. We're still kind of talking about some risk of some other retailers going bankrupt or at least closing a meaningful amount of stores. So I'm just kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about your watch list and kind of what you're seeing out there.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. Tayo, we saw this kind of cycle of bankruptcies starting at the beginning of 2016, and we had a fairly significant watch list as we headed into 2016. And if you'll recall, we were fairly cautious as we went into 2016 and probably more so than others in the A-quality mall sector. And as we've moved through the bankruptcies of '16 and '17, which were record years, virtually every one of those bankruptcies is on our watch list. As we moved into 2018, it was lighter. And then moving into 2019 with Gymboree and Charlotte Russe, those tenants have been on our watch list for years, as Doug mentioned in his comments. So no surprises there, and our watch list has shrunk considerably from even a year ago. So that's cause for optimism on the leasing front as well as the leasing activity and the ability to replace that space pretty quickly. And Doug, I'll let you elaborate on that.","Doug Healey","Yes. I mean, the leasing environment right now is good and it continues to improve. In my opening remarks, by way of examples, whether it's Apple or Lululemon or Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, these guys are all opening stores. They've got significant open-to-buys. They're coming out with brand concepts. So that's the traditional side. But I think the real key here is that we've got an opportunity to reset as we merchandise our centers. So as we start to lose some apparel, it gives us the opportunity to take traditional mall with traditional apparel stores and really turn them into town centers that are something for everybody. So as we look to re-merchandise, as we look to reset, these malls are becoming great places for some boxes and theaters and entertainments and restaurants and fitness. Experiential retailers right now are extremely popular as are the DMVBs and the international component. And as we recently talked about, co-working will become very popular. So as we continue to lose some tenants that may not be relevant these days through bankruptcies, our ability to replace from a traditional standpoint and from a new category standpoint gives us optimism.","Operator","And we'll take our last question today from Michael Mueller at JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller","Just a quick one. What's been the average duration on the leases signed this year? And how has that trended compared to recent years?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I think it's fairly consistent at six years. It's been remarkably resilient at that level for about the last 5 years, and we haven't really seen much of a change in that.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thanks, Mike. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at ICSC this month or at NAREIT in June.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and I would now like to turn the call over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you and thank you everyone for joining us today on our second quarter, 2013 earnings call.","During the course of this call management will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to uncertainties and risk associated with our business and industry. For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company\u2019s press release and SEC filings.","As this call will be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that the passage of time can render information stale, and you should not rely on the continued accuracy of this material.","During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC\u2019s Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the press release and the supplemental 8-K filings for the quarter, which are posted in the Investor Section of the company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Ed Coppola, President; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you Jean.

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or Art, John Perry or Jean Wood.","It was another great quarter. We executed on our plan to dispose of non-core assets. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and we had a very strong operating performance during the quarter. That combined with the blockbuster grand opening of Fashion Outlets of Chicago last week, it has been a very productive 90 days since our last earnings call.","Looking at the operating metrics, we had good leasing volume and spreads. We signed 262,000 square feet of leases during the quarter, with a positive re-leasing spread of just over 14%. We had very strong occupancy at 93.8%. That was up 110 basis points compared to June 30 of last year.","FFO for the quarter, adjusted FFO was up 18% to $0.87 per share. That compared to $0.74 a share a year ago. Some of the things that impacted that growth were same center NOI, which increased 4.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. That statistic does not include straight lining or rent, lease termination revenue or SFAS 141 revenue.","This strong increase was driven by increased occupancy, positive re-leasing spreads in 2012 that are now rolling through 2013 revenues, and CPI increases on leases. This is the strongest increase we\u2019ve seen since before the recession. It\u2019s obviously well above our previous guidance range of 2.75% to 3.25% and as indicated in our earnings release, this morning we are raising our guidance and an important part of that is an upward revision of same center NOI guidance to 3.75% to 4.25% for the year.","We had gain on land sales during the quarter of $2.2 million. Those were included in our previously issued guidance. There\u2019s also significant interest savings during the quarter as our average interest rate went down to 4.3% compared to 4.7%, the second quarter of 2012.","There\u2019s another strong quarter in terms of balance sheet improvement. Our debt to market cap dropped to 41%. Our floating rate debt has been significantly reduced. Today it stands at 18% of total debt, compared to 31% of total debt at June 30, 2012. Our average debt maturity has increased to 5.6 years. That compared to 3.9 years at June 30th of \u201812.","Concurrent with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index this past quarter, we sold 2.5 million shares of common equity, at an average share price of $70.42 per share. This stock was sold under our ATM program. The net proceeds were $171 million that were used to pay down debt.","Yesterday we committed to an $850 million life company refinancing of a debt on Tysons Corner super regional mall. This is a 10 year fixed rate loan, 4.1% interest rate. It will mature in January of 2024 and that pays off a loan that was approximately $300 million and had a GAAP interest rate of 4.78 and an actual coupon up in the mid-5s. The company owns 50% of Tysons and we\u2019ll see roughly $275 million of excess loan proceeds and those proceeds we\u2019ll use to further reduce debt, primarily floating rate debt.","Also effective today, we closed on an extension in rate reduction on our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit. The new credit facility has an August 2018 maturity date, so we stretched that maturity out two years from the prior facility, all in a five-year term and the interest rate also was reduced. Our current leverage level it was reduced to 1.5% over LIBOR and its down from the old facility, which was 2% of the LIBOR. We can expand this $1.5 billion facility to $2 billion at our election.","Looking now at FFO guidance, we gave new guidance in the press release and the range was increased $0.03 to $3.38 to $3.48. Included in that guidance change was the assumption of $530 million of assets that we\u2019ve actually sold year-to-date. Art will be discussing the asset sales in more detail in a few moments.","As I mentioned, the same center NOI growth assumption has increased 100 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4.25%. We are also cutting our estimated lease termination revenue. Initially we had $7 million in our guidance, we are cutting that down to $3 million based on what we\u2019ve seen to date and what we expect for the remainder of the year. So there\u2019s a $4 million reduction there.","This guidance factors in the May ATM equity issuance, which was not in our previous guidance. Obviously there\u2019s a dilutive effect there. If you look at the dilutive impact of the asset sales and the ATM on 2013, it\u2019s about $0.11 a share. That\u2019s very close to the range we have when we gave original guidance on the dispositions of potential dilution of $0.07 to $0.14. So that $0.11 of dilution has been factored into the new guidance range.","At this point I\u2019m going to turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola ","Thank you Tom. Second quarter was a quarter of many terrific events and openings for us. Probably the most significant event that occurred for us in the second quarter is one that really hasn\u2019t captured that much attention, but is really a seminal moment in the history of Macerich and that was our inclusion in the midpoint of the second quarter into the S&P 500.","This is of particular note, because Macerich was the first REIT to be added to the S&P 500 since the dark days of March of 2009. We are particularly gratified and pleased to be included into the S&P 500. The days of March of 2009 led us to the conclusion that we wanted to pursue a strategy of owning fortress assets and we wanted to create a fortress balance sheet.","Over the years, the last four years, you\u2019ve noted the great strides that we have made on our balance sheet, and on the fortress asset side of things, we\u2019ve improved our existing assets and we\u2019ve pruned out some of the assets that are not fortress assets or completely core. So we are extremely pleased with the progress that we made over the past four years, which really culminated in my mind with our inclusion in the S&P 500 in the mid-point of May of this year.","I\u2019m going to give a little bit of color on the dispositions that we have completed for the year. You\u2019ll remember in February, when we initially gave guidance this year, that we indicated that we were putting a number of assets on the market. That we were agnostic as to timing and price and that we didn\u2019t expect to sell all of the assets that were being exposed to the market.","In our May conference call we guided to the number of assets that we felt that we would sell and we said what we think we are going to sell, six or seven assets, and were guiding you towards the low point of the $500 million to $1 billion of total disposition proceeds. In fact, we have sold six assets, five retail assets and one office asset.","The assets that were sold and the dates are that the Redmond Town Center office project was sold May 29 to a private equity buyer, for a gross price of about $185 million. That was in a joint venture with Cadillac Fairview; May 31 we sold Green Tree Mall for just over $80 million to a private equity buyer; June 4 we sold Billings, Rimrock Mall and Northridge Mall in Salinas for just approximately $230 million to a private equity buyer. June 12, those were wholly owned assets, Rimrock, Northridge and Green Tree.","June 12, we sold Kitsap Mall, which was in a joint venture. It was in the greater Silverdale marketplace for just under $130 million, and then just this week we closed on the Redmond Town Center retail disposition for approximately $130 million, August 1, also in a joint venture.","Our pro rata share of the disposition proceeds was approximately $530 million. There was debt that encumbered these assets; our pro rata share of about $60 million with a net new cash that we raised from the real estate disposition was approximately $470 million.","You\u2019ll remember in our initial guidance, we said we\u2019d sell between $500 million and $1 billion and our assumption was that there would be the assets that would be sold, would have about 33% property debt on them, so the opportunity was there to raise approximately $650 million of new equity.","Shortly after our earnings call on May 2 of this year, three days later in fact, we were notified that we were being included in the S&P 500. We sat back and we looked at the possibility of using our ATM as part of the inclusion trade and came to the conclusion that our best strategy to completely retool our balance sheet for the year with complete certainty was to close the deals that we had under a real estate contract, and to raise $170 million of common equity through the use of the ATM as part of the inclusion trade.","That got us to net new cash that was raised for the year of about $640 million, which if you look at it would have achieved the high end of the objective that we announced in February in terms of the amount of cash that we wanted to raise.","As to dispositions going forward for the balance of the year, we are continuing to have some conversations with some folks on some assets, but we are in a position to state that we\u2019ve achieved our objectives for the year and that we\u2019ll be very selective in terms of further dispositions.","We are going to continue our policy of pursuing a fortress asset and a fortress balance sheet portfolio and as part of that; dispositions are a key component of our strategy. So those conversations will continue over the next couple of years.","There\u2019s nothing in particular of any meaning that\u2019s under contract at this point in time, but not to say that there won\u2019t be further disposition later in the year, but given that there\u2019s nothing under contract at this point in time, other than a very small asset. It would be imprudent to go ahead and project any further dispositions into our guidance numbers for the balance of the year.","Turning now to development. Obviously the big story post end of the quarter for us was the grand opening in the Fashion Outlets of Chicago. Many of you toured the asset with us in early June and we can tell you that the grand opening was beyond the expectations of all of our retailers and certainly in line with our very high expectations.","We had great customer traffic counts, so we estimate that we had in excess of 60,000 people per day in the property from Thursday, August 1, and that held steady all the way through Sunday, August 4. So we had an extremely strong four-day grand opening, from Thursday to Sunday.","It\u2019s unusual to see grand opening sales on a Sunday exceed the actual grand opening of three days prior, but many of our retailers in fact told us that their Saturday and Sunday sales were even higher than their grand opening sales.","Retailers pretty much across the board told us they were several hundred data percentage points, 200%, 300%, 400% above business plan. The vast majority of our retailers told us that the grand opening at Fashion Outlets of Chicago was either the best ever grand opening or in the top two or three that they had ever opened. So we\u2019re extremely pleased with the reception. It\u2019s in line with our expectations.","The challenge for the retailers at this point in time is that sales were so strong, now it\u2019s a simple logistics of replenishment and even increasing their own expectations. So we are thrilled with the grand opening of FOC and we look forward to reporting the results on that as we get facts and figures on sales during the balance of this year.","Turning briefly to the balance of the development pipeline, Tysons densification proceeds on time and on budget. Leasing of the office building is extremely active. We\u2019ve got a number of users that we are talking to right now. So our goal, our internal goal of being 80% to 85% leased by the end of this year, we see that as being completely attainable.","Also of interesting note, if you think about it, is to take a look at the funding of the Tysons development. With the refinance that was announced yesterday, we are pulling approximately $275 million of excess refinancing proceeds out of the retail project. So that repatriates all of the capital that we spent to-date on the densification of Tysons Corner and pre-funds all of the future expenditures that will be spent over the next 16 to 18 months.","Our balance sheet is in terrific shape and at this point in time we are thrilled with our progress, with the leasing results, the operating results, the improvement in same center NOI and would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Art Coppola","Hey Craig.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America ","Hey, good afternoon. The sales productivity year-over-year number of 6.2%, does that include the changes in your portfolio, as well as the gains of the previously existing centers?","Tom O'Hern","Yes, it does Craig. It excludes the dispositions that have happened subsequent to June 30, 2012. So that would exclude the recent sales that happened in May and June, as well as those that happened in the second half of last year.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America ","And your sense, if you were to break that out between the changes to your portfolio versus the pre-existing gains, how that might break out?","Tom O'Hern","Remember, there\u2019s a pretty high productivity joint venture that was disposed of in the third quarter of last year. So on the same center basis the increase would have been more than the 6% we\u2019ve reflected there.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America ","Okay. And looking at the two centers you brought in the New York area, Green Acres and Kings Plaza, it looks like of the two, that Kings Plaza\u2019s going to start first?","Art Coppola","In terms of the re-merchandising?","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America ","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, yes.","Art Coppola","Both centers are in very active conversations, negotiations. Right now we are focused, but there\u2019s been a tremendous amount of leasing activity at both centers and Bobby, do you want to comment on some of the leasing activity?","As we get into the major expenditures, we have not paid the dollar amount or the timing on either one of those yet, because those involve anchor negotiations. But the re-merchandising efforts have been very significant at both centers and our re-merchandising and redevelopment plans are crystallizing. We\u2019re not quite ready to be more specific on the dollar spend or the exact timing, but they certainly are accelerating in terms of the timing. Bobby, you want to answer?","Bob Perlmutter","Craig, this is Bob Perlmutter. Just to respond to a couple of comments. We obviously had a strong platform in these markets, which we were able to expand, which allowed us to generate some pretty good leasing activity at both centers, pretty much off the bat.","So the development, the merchandising is well started and we are very pleased with the reception in terms of not only the economics, but the quality of the tenants we were able to bring in and the development plans, while not as immediate are making strong progress and will really allow us to take both centers and position them at the next level, which we think the markets can support.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America ","Great, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christy McElroy with UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS ","Hi, good morning everyone. Tom, just regarding the Tysons REFI, I think you\u2019ve been working on that a couple months now. Did you ultimately end up going with life insurance or CMBS lenders? I know Tysons would be treated a little bit differently than your sort of average mall mortgage, but can you give us a little bit of color on how the market changed over the time period that you were working on the financing and how competitive are portfolio lenders versus CMBS today.","Tom O\u2019Hern ","Right. No, you\u2019re right Christie. At the time we exposed that to the market was really in early June where there\u2019s a tremendous amount of volatility in the interest rate markets. CMBS market was in a bit of flux.","But the life companies were extremely competitive and this is going to be a combination of three top life companies that we\u2019ve done a lot of business with and they came in and they were extremely competitive and it was their chance to grab a great piece of business. So we think we got excellent execution from some of our relationship lenders on this and that\u2019s the direction we are going.","Christy McElroy - UBS ","Okay. Having just completed Chicago and you\u2019re in the process of leasing the Niagara expansion, but you are sort of still, first and foremost a regional mall landlord, can you give us a somewhat unbiased sense for how retailers are viewing outlet store growth versus full price today? What you think that means for factory outlet construction over the next five years and what do you think your next major outlet project will be?","Art Coppola","Sure Christie, I\u2019ll comment on that. Look, it remains consistent, but it\u2019s simply one of the three major distribution channels that they have. They have full price, they have off price, which is usually outlet and then they have e-commerce and they vary in terms of their percentages, but they tend to be say 60%, 65%, full price, 20 %, 25% of the mall price and 10% to 15% dot com.","Obviously there are many more off-price opportunities to build in the United States than there are full price opportunities. So if you look at new developments that they\u2019re going into, the majority of new developments are going into are half-price.","Our next major development is the expansion of Fashion Outlets of Niagara. It\u2019s a proven asset. The amount of GLA that we are adding there is close to 150,000 square feet, as well as re-merchandising the mall. It can amount to almost building a major new outlet property at a proven location, so that\u2019s our focus right now. Beyond that we have really nothing else to announce on that front.","We\u2019re pleased to be in the space. Look, as we\u2019ve indicated previously, we see ourselves owning on one or two hands most number of outlet centers over the next five, even eight, 10 years. So it\u2019s part of the retailer\u2019s strategy. It\u2019s part of our strategy, the difference being we are definitely very selective.","We obviously cannot compete in terms of size or scale. We have to compete in terms of quality, but the retailers that have joined us at FOC are with us at FON, Niagara, and are going to be coming to Niagara. They\u2019re thrilled about the opportunities at each and it just fits within their overall distribution strategies.","Christy McElroy - UBS ","Okay, then just one last quick question on the dispositions. Thanks for the breakout on the timing and the amounts. I think you mentioned the cap rate on the five assets in Q2 averaged 7.5%. Can you disclose the cap rate on the Redmond retail?","Art Coppola","No. I\u2019m not going to disclose out of respect for the buyers, even though they are all private entities. We\u2019re not going to get into the disclosures on cap rates by property. At the beginning of the year we indicated that we were agnostic on price, but we were very focused on timing and certainty on execution and that was really our focus. It was timing and certainty of execution.","We were not after the last penny. When we found the right buyer, we moved forward. The blended composite cap rate is a little bit better than 7.5; it\u2019s closer to say, 7.25, but that\u2019s brought down because of an even lower cap rate than that on the office component at Redmond Town Center.","Christy McElroy - UBS ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Art Coppola","Hey Quentin.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Hey, good morning. Just in terms of the same store NOI, which got you back up to 4.6% this quarter, I know that you had some drag from some of the redevelopment properties. Could you maybe just talk about the guidance number for this year and how much drag there is on same store NOI from some of the redevelopments you\u2019re preparing yourself for?","Tom O'Hern","That would primarily be North Bridge in Chicago and Broadway Plaza. Those are both still in the same center number and there\u2019s probably negative impact of roughly 25 basis points on those.","Art Coppola","And on our last call, I was pretty specific on this one, just to remind you. On Tysons Corner and at Queens in particular, and even at Kings Plaza and Green Acres, when you\u2019re re-merchandising and you\u2019re getting extremely high rents and even at Santa Monica Place, now that we\u2019re re-merchandizing that, the frictional vacancy number could be quite significant. We don\u2019t pull those out and call them redevelopment centers.","So I had indicated that, I think in our last earnings call that the impact could be as much as 50 to 75 basis points when you add it all up. We haven\u2019t sat down and added them all up, because we\u2019re not pulling them out. If we pulled them out and throw them into a redevelopment category, we will become extremely in center.","I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re that different than others in this regard, but it\u2019s extremely apparent to us than when looking at the numbers and we have such a high percentage of our income coming from extremely high quality centers and where we are constantly re-merchandising these centers; the re-merchandising efforts at Tysons are extremely significant, the re-merchandising efforts at Queens.","I\u2019ll give an example at Queens where one 10,000-foot tenant could cause a $3 million swing in income for the year in terms of the frictional vacancy, but it\u2019s part of raising the income from that state to 50%. But does it hit the same center NOI? Yes, significantly.","But look, we\u2019re all in the same boat on that. Many things factor into that number, but those are quality NAV issues and that\u2019s where I made the remark on our last call, that I believe the same center NOI can be myopic and two dimensional and forget about and ignore the NAV accretion that comes from re-merchandising a Kings Plaza or at Green Acres, but time proves it all.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Art, its Michael Bilerman speaking. Just a question, just on I guess future potential asset sales and I recognize you sort of hit the high end of your equity target, having raised the comment with the sales that you completed, that were more low leveraged, but you did expose the market to upwards of $1.5 billion of potential assets.","How do you sort of look at the assets that you\u2019ve now kept? Was it the market pricing that wasn\u2019t there? How do you sort of think about putting capital into those assets, getting employees driven about those assets, that they were on a sale list and are now not?","Art Coppola","Michael thanks for the question. It\u2019s actually been a good process. Our asset management, leasing and finance teams put a tremendous amount of work into the preparation of the books and the offerings that we\u2019re in on some of these assets. Frankly, it caused the senior management to have a renewed focus on the assets, just as part of the market, as part of giving an overview of a number of assets to perspective buyers.","We sat there and talked about assets in great detail, with outsiders that we frankly don\u2019t spend that kind of time talking about internally a lot of the time. So if anything, I would say that the assets that are not being sold, have a renewed focus and a renewed energy. It\u2019s frankly gotten us a little bit re-acquainted with the assets, because it is easy to have your focus be primarily on the top 10 or 15 or 20 assets, where the vast majority of your income is coming from.","Do we want to be in that business of owning some of our bottom tiered assets forever? No. Do we think that we can make the ones that we\u2019ve retained better? Yes. Is there a strong probability that we\u2019ll continue to dispose of assets, including the ones that were marketed that did not sell at this point in time? Yes.","Look, from the buyer\u2019s perspective, they took the low-hanging fruit for them. They cherry-picked to some degree and we were okay with that, because we were after certainty of execution and we didn\u2019t dislike any of the assets that we put out there and we are happy to own the ones that we retained and I think that we\u2019ll actually have better performance on those assets as a result of going through the process.","I also think that there will be continued dispositions of not only assets that were exposed to the market, but possibly some others, but that\u2019s part of the grand strategy of focusing our efforts on fewer assets, but bigger assets and pruning the portfolio over a period of time.","We completely retooled our balance sheet to levels that existed before the $1.7 billion of acquisitions that we had last year. Our development pipeline is completely self-funded, FOC is open, Tysons is even pre-funded with this refinance and the future development pipeline that\u2019s sitting out there, which is quite significant, we have essentially a completely untapped new five-year line of credit available to us to fund that.","But internally, my long-term and our long-term goals would be to fund that development pipeline through continued pruning of some of our non-core assets and we intend to do that and the market is still there to do that.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Did anything fall out, I guess in sort of everything that happened in late May or June that you were sort of working on that got materially re-priced for those assets. Just trying to get some color on the marketplace.","Art Coppola","There was one contract that coming right up on the go-hard date or the end of the due diligence date, the buyer asked for price adjustments and we terminated the contract and that happened in late April.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors ","Thank you. Just thinking about the expanding strategy you talked about in the past, Art, since Fiesta Mall is doing special servicing. It\u2019s one of the malls I think had been targeted for that strategy. What does it tell us about how deep and wide you can go in terms of the Hispanic focus strategy and what\u2019s happened in general to the malls where you\u2019ve implemented the strategy?","Art Coppola","There is really no message there, other than we probably should not have \u2013 we tried to put it into the marketing program that is targeted, that we call the Vanguardia and we didn\u2019t give a lot of traction, because as we looked at the trade area demographics, we didn\u2019t have a percentage-wise or population-wise, the concentration of Hispanic population in the Fiesta trade area immediately.","On top of that you\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of retail in the southeastern part of the Phoenix marketplace. So to me it was no message, other than maybe we shouldn\u2019t have even included it in our Vanguardia marketing efforts. When you look at the other properties that are in that program, they\u2019ve been achieving same center NOI growth that is in the 5% to 6% neighborhood over the past three years since we really initiated the program.","So we\u2019re pleased with the progress on the pure-plays that we\u2019ve got in there, which are really Panorama Mall, Desert Sky, Pacific View and we\u2019ve had good success there and it\u2019s really just more of a marketing approach. For me there\u2019s no message on Fiesta.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors ","Okay. In regards to Fashion Outlets of Chicago, I think in the past you had talked about roughly $900 per square foot as being a target, once the property is stabilized. Is that still the prospects for the asset or do you think it\u2019s changed given what you\u2019ve observed with the grand opening?","Art Coppola","Honestly, I hope I never put out a number like that. Somebody may have made reference somewhere along the line that a retailer generally would have to have expectations that would be in the $500 a foot to $1,000 a foot to pay the rent that they pay, but I don\u2019t remember ever putting out any numbers along those lines. The numbers are going to speak for themselves.","Look, when you\u2019ve got retailers that are telling you that the vast majority of them \u2013 we had people tell us that in the first four hours on the grand opening day, they achieved their entire objective for the four day grand opening weekend. A tremendous number of retailers told us that it was either their best ever or their second best ever opening, ever.","So we put that into the context of the outlet industry, put it into the context of where it\u2019s located, put it into the context of what you see when you walk the center, yesterday, Monday at 4:30, we still had 60 people in line to get into a Tory Burch store. You had products; stores were locked because they had too many people inside with the line outside.","All expectations are that it\u2019s going to be great, but until the numbers come through, let\u2019s let the numbers speak for themselves.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors ","Okay, I might have misremembered that. And then just finally, in terms of when I look at your community and power center bucket of assets, if you were to think three to five years out from now, how many of the 10 properties that are listed here do you expect to have still under ownership?","Art Coppola","None.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors ","Good. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank ","Hi, hey everyone. Just want to go back to the disposition conversation just a little bit. In terms of the ones that didn\u2019t sell, I know price wasn\u2019t your main driving focus there, but in terms of just overall demand for the ones that didn\u2019t sell, as well as the price indications you were receiving, how did that compare to your expectations going into the process?","Art Coppola","I don\u2019t want to be cute with you, but when I said I was agnostic, I was truly agnostic. We had expectations that we could achieve dispositions in the $500 million to $1 billion range in the mid-7\u2019s we did. There are continued conversations that are going on and we\u2019ll see what happens.","We were execution focused, not price focused. Look, at the end of the day, we disposed of assets that were maybe 4% of our NOI. So negotiating for the last 1% in price was not what it was all about.","Having certainty of execution and getting it behind us, closing deals within five months of the time that you go out with an offering memorandum, it\u2019s really an incredible achievement, given the process of getting the OM out there, and the property tours, due diligence periods, estoppel periods, I mean that\u2019s really a very short time if you look at the marketing of the major properties that have historically taken some significant time to sell.","So we\u2019ve achieved our goal, which means we achieved our objective. On the other hand, we do continue to have interest from folks and we will continue to have one-off conversations with folks and anything that happens from this point forward will be incremental, but you shouldn\u2019t have it in any of your numbers.","We\u2019ve got plenty of room in our numbers and our guidance ranges that if anything happened in the way of dispositions, it shouldn\u2019t affect our guidance numbers in terms of our range. And as part of our long-term goal, we remain committed to rotating out of the bottom 25% or so of our portfolio and reinvesting that money into the top 25% of our portfolio.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, thanks. I was just trying to get a sense of sort of the broader demand for that group five type of asset, but that\u2019s fine. Just maybe going to the sales trends in the portfolio. Can you provide some color on sort of geographic and sales categories that showed some strength?","Art Coppola","Going back to your other question, in addition to the people that actually bought deals, which I think we had three buyers, there were another eight or 10 groups that put in offers, so there was plenty of people out there. But again, we achieved our objective. In terms of regional sales activity Bob, do you want to comment on that?","Bob Perlmutter ","Year-to-date, our strongest regions are the East Coast and Arizona.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. And any color on sales categories that stood out for you in the quarter?","Art Coppola","Categories that have done the best, include home furnishings, jewelers, athletic footwear and apparel and then we obviously see certain brands like Michael Kors and Lululemon continue to have very strong increases.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, thank you.","Art Coppola","Obviously Apple has to...","Bob Perlmutter ","Right, the trend for Apple was down in the second quarter, but obviously they are still a very productive and very important tenant for all the centers.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Samit Parikh with ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI ","Good morning. I noticed in the quarter your tenant recovery ratio was up pretty significantly from last quarter and up pretty significantly year-over-year. I guess my question is, is that something timing related or is it really just a product of a stronger portfolio today?","Tom O'Hern","Well, it\u2019s a combination. To some extent you get some timing differences between the first and second quarter, but I think in general it\u2019s as a result of the quality. You keep in mind that we also have tenant recoveries that are based on CPI increases that typically come into place. It\u2019s no longer a triple net environment. In most cases about two-thirds of our leases have fixed CAM. So to the extent we can control our costs, which we are doing an excellent job of this year, we also see some benefit on the recovery rate there, but it\u2019s a combination.","Samit Parikh - ISI ","Is it safe to say that we should see that benefit for the remainder of the year?","Art Coppola","You will. You may not see it at the same level. I mean there can be some difference, timing differences on when the expenses flow through and so in an environment that\u2019s not a triple net environment, you\u2019re going to see the recovery rate fluctuate a little bit more than you would in the triple net environment.","Samit Parikh - ISI ","Okay. How much temp space do you have right now?","Tom O'Hern","Well, included in the occupancy, there\u2019s about 6% is tenants that we consider to be greater than six months, but less than \u2013 they are up to a year, six months to a year is what we consider temporary. If the space is less than six months we don\u2019t include it in our occupancy status.","Samit Parikh - ISI ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then I guess last question Art, what sort of level of caution do you think that you are building into your guidance for the holiday season this year? It seems to us based on what you\u2019ve done in the first half of the year and even considering some of the dilutive activity and given that sort of the Chicago outlet\u2019s, NOI will be coming on for the rest of the year that there is some level of being conservative there. So would be great if you could comment a little bit on that.","Tom O'Hern","Well, I mean there\u2019s always a certain amount of guesswork, particularly in the categories of tenant recoveries and percentage rent. We\u2019ve taken a hard look at recoveries, we probably have visibility that goes out 90 to 120 days and that\u2019s why we cut our guidance there.","So, I think you have to keep in mind that that\u2019s part of our guidance number. It was a reduction of about $0.03 a share for a more cautious view of tenant recoveries. In terms of percentage rent, it\u2019s hard to predict what the tenants are going to do in the fourth quarter. Most of the percentage rent comes through in the fourth quarter. We give it our best estimate, but you don\u2019t truly know until you\u2019ve made your way through that quarter. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s a range in there at $0.10, because there are some things that are more an estimate than a certainty.","Art Coppola","You do have projected relatively very low bad debt numbers. We, in terms of caution, it\u2019s really the reverse of that, given our visibility into the future, potential termination pipeline. We\u2019ve reduced dramatically our original numbers that we had internally for termination income, which we normally get termination income when a tenant goes away and they still have credit. So that actually goes the opposite direction.","Look, we are trying to keep the noise of having great same center NOI growth, coupled with the noise that comes from the dilution of dispositions to a minimum. So that drove us to really wanting certainty of execution on the disposition.","It does, I will tell you give us especially as we raised guidance last quarter and we raised guidance this quarter, it probably leaves us a little bit conservative, because if for some reason there are dispositions that do occur between now and the end of the year, that obviously would be dilutive, we wouldn\u2019t want to be in a position to be busting our guidance range as a result of that.","So if there is any caution or conservatism that\u2019s built into the numbers, it\u2019s not operational; it\u2019s probably more on the disposition side.","Samit Parikh - ISI ","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas- KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Hi, thanks. Jordan Sadler\u2019s on with me as well. I just had a question. Going back to the tenant sales, I was just wondering if you can share with us what sales growth was in the quarter. So its just comparable tenant sales in the quarter, not on a rolling 12 month basis.","Tom O'Hern","We don\u2019t typically break it out by quarter. I mean, I think to get a sales trend we typically feel you need 12 months there. So historically, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve reflected is the trailing 12 months.","Todd Thomas- KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Okay. A question for Bob, it sounded like recently, while there\u2019s a lot of discussion about retailers down-sizing sort of broadly, that you were seeing some demand from larger retailers looking for bigger boxes, so Forever 21\u2019s of the world and a few others.","I was just wondering, is that sort of isolated to a few specific spaces in your malls or do you think that that\u2019s a trend that you\u2019re seeing gain a little more momentum than you have over the last few years? And how big will some of these retailers go?","Bob Perlmutter","What we are seeing is the desire for space at the top tier centers. It\u2019s really led many of these tenants to look at configurations and sizes that are more than just the profitability of that individual location.","So at some of our centers like Queens and Tysons, where spaces are at a premium, we\u2019ve seen not only the traditional retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, who have always been willing to work with a two level box. We\u2019ve seen some more traditional tenants like The Gap, potentially Victoria\u2019s Secret and some others start to look and look at these locations as key to their business operations in the entire region, as opposed to just on an individual basis.","So historically the thought was always to take a big space, carve it into small spaces, increase your rent and what we are really seeing at the top tier centers is almost the opposite effect, where we are able to accumulate bigger spaces, many of the retailers stepping up and creating premium rentals.","Todd Thomas- KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Okay. So it\u2019s mostly isolated in some of the top tier centers, you would say?","Bob Perlmutter","Yes.","Todd Thomas- KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Okay, and then just a last question for Tom. I just wanted to clarify; I think you said you cut guidance by about $0.03 a share for tenant recoveries. You mean lease termination fee income, as opposed to tenant reimbursements, is that right?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, that\u2019s correct, Todd, termination revenue.","Todd Thomas- KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Right. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Yang with Evercore.","Art Coppola","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Hi, good morning. Just another question on guidance. I totally understand why you keep a wide range, given obviously the typical unknowns, the noise, the conservatism, but your prior guidance did have $0.07 to $0.14 of dilution from the asset sales and it seems like the guidance range should have at least narrowed, just based on having wrapped up that process.","So it is still a little curious that the guidance range is still $0.10 and especially since you have more clarity on lease termination fees. So maybe asking it in a different way, is there anything in the back half of the year that you feel is maybe more uncertain than when you first established guidance.","Art Coppola","Well, like I said, the disposition side of things could still have a meaningful impact.","Ben Yang - Evercore","I thought you said that that was pretty much wrapped up for the year.","Art Coppola","I did say that and that is true. I also said that we are committed to continuing to prune our portfolio; that people are continuing to talk to us; that we are not under contract with anybody, but it is not out of the question that something could happen on that front that could still be meaningful.","And so if that goes beyond this month, this quarter or this year, that\u2019s something we\u2019re committed to over a long period of time and obviously having had a number of assets in the markets that still could have an impact.","Tom O\u2019Hern","A couple of things on that. That $0.10 range on the FFO, even if you use the mid-point, that\u2019s less than 3% of the total FFO. So I still don\u2019t think that\u2019s that wide of a range, given that you have the most volatility in the fourth quarter as it relates to specialty leasing.","In the fourth quarter you get a third to half of your full year specialty leasing comes in, that\u2019s a little hard to predict, as well as percentage rents. So typically the most volatility is going to be in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why we keep the range.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay. It just seemed like the impact of asset sales, if you can get them done even this year just would be very modest I guess to your numbers, but that\u2019s fair enough, I guess.","Tom O\u2019Hern","There\u2019s not a lot of the year left. I mean if there were to be additional dispositions, the dilutive effect on 2013 would be pretty minimal in my opinion.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay. That\u2019s what I was thinking as well.","Art Coppola","Given where we are, I hear your comment, it\u2019s noted, recorded; I understand it. There are a number of things that are still out there, including the dispositions that could affect that number, but I understand your appetite to see a tighter range. We\u2019ll keep that in mind for the future.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Right, and then just a final question for Tom. I think you made an earlier comment; did you say that the dispositions actually hurt the reported growth and sales per square foot, that if the you...","Tom O\u2019Hern","Year-over-year, they did. Yes they did.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Can you quantify how much the impact was from\u2026","Tom O\u2019Hern","It\u2019s about $5 a foot.","Ben Yang - Evercore","So if you didn\u2019t sell any assets year-over-year, your portfolio sales would be $5 higher; that\u2019s the interpretation.","Tom O'Hern","The spread would be $5 wider. Yes.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay. All right, thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Yes, good morning out there.","Art Coppola","Very good. How are you?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Hey, how are you? First question is for Tom. Tom, in the first quarter I think your guys ended line of credit balance was $635 million. You raised $630 million of net proceeds and the line of credit is now $405, which sounds like you spent $400 million. So maybe there\u2019s some stuff that closed post quarter that\u2019s not in there.","But just sort of want to understand; one, what some of the spending was in the quarter, and then two, the line of credit is already sort of at a healthy amount and you guys haven\u2019t started on the redevelopment program. So just sort of curious what your thoughts are for managing the line of credit as balancing the redevelopment projects that are in the shadow pipeline.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes, I\u2019ll walk you through that, Alexander. We did pay off the FlatIron mortgage, which you probably don\u2019t have factored in there in your cash flow analysis, but at the end of the quarter, we\u2019ll start there and go forward, was $405 million outstanding at June 30.","We subsequently sold Redmond Town Center, our share was about $63 million. So that would go against the $405 million and on top of that, which hasn\u2019t happened yet, is the Tysons financing, which we expect to happen August 30 or September 1. That should be another $275 million. So with that, the line of credit will be under $100 million.","There will be additional borrowings on the Tysons project, which will come through there, but I would expect we would end September with a line of credit balance probably well under $200 million and I would expect it to not be much more than that by year-end and that\u2019s absent any additional asset sales.","So we\u2019re in great shape and as you hopefully noticed, we renegotiated that line. We\u2019ve got $2 billion of capacity and the maturity date\u2019s been extended to 2018, as well as we tightened the borrowers spread to 150 over LIBOR. So the balance sheet\u2019s in great shape and in particularly the line of credit.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Okay, then that\u2019s helpful. Yes, I did notice the line of credit, the increase on your credit card capacity.","And following along on the redevelopment\/development, the shadow pipeline moved around a little bit from first quarter to second quarter. Art, you spoke a little bit about it, but sort of the big picture, as you guys map out what you want to do for the next round, is that more driven by what anchors want to do with their space or potentially coming to a mall or development or is most of this shifting around and timing and spend more driven by small shop opportunity?","Art Coppola","Actually neither. If you look at the shadow pipeline in particular, because the actual process pipeline is I think very specific between FOC, FON, Niagara and Tysons Corner, but you go to the shadow pipeline.","It\u2019s really more the fact that most all of these, Broadway Plaza, Green Acres, Kings, Cerritos, even the new center to be built at Goodyear, they\u2019re all going to be extremely meaningful in terms of what they are going to do for us, and its really a matter of recognizing that these are generational opportunities, and while we want to give you a visibility into the future as to what\u2019s out there, we also want to not rush into construction and miss a generational opportunity by being hasty.","So it\u2019s really if anything an appetite to just make sure that we don\u2019t leave any NAV value creation opportunities on the table, given the fact that most of these opportunities are really generational in nature.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Okay. And then just finally, Queens Center; I think you guys still had, whether it was additional level to add on top or I think there was also a parcel adjacent, but just given the productivity of that center and also that you are talking about doing Green Acres and Kings, is there any potential to seeing Queens Center on the shadow pipeline in the near future?","Art Coppola","Not likely. If it does, we\u2019ve got estimates of going up and converting some of the top level parking deck to retail. Those dollar numbers are not huge. They were in the $25 million zip code and we just have not to date found the right tenant to take two level spaces that would incorporate that space at the right returns to make sense of that.","Do I think that will happen over time? Yes, I do. We\u2019ve got 40,000-45,000 feet of FARs sitting up there on the top level deck, where Macy\u2019s currently is open for business on their fourth level above the concourse for future expansion, but it\u2019s not something that we would pursue without getting the right returns and it\u2019s not even something that would make shadow pipeline today, but it is in our FAR.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Okay. Thank you.","Tom O'Hern","I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question, operator.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller - JP Morgan","I guess looking at the redevelopment pipeline, what are the obstacles you have to get past or what do you have to get comfortable with to move forward with Broadway and Estrella in particular?","Art Coppola","Broadway I think we\u2019re going to be in a position to be very specific on our next call as to the timing of demolition, as well as the reopening dates. I\u2019d rather not get into the specifics of the one or two approvals that remain at Broadway at this point in time; it wouldn\u2019t serve our purposes.","At Estrella, the opening date budgeted there was 2016, 2017, given the anchor level of interest is still looking solid and we are not at the point of doing pre-leasing at this point in time, other than collecting anchor interest and the anchor interest is there to build. So really again, given the generational opportunities that there\u2019s really only going to be one full priced mall built in Phoenix probably in the next number of years, we just want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure that we have the proper amount of wind in our backs in terms of specialty store leasing when we actually go ahead and open it.","So they are on the same pipeline, because we think we are going to do it. They haven\u2019t moved up to the in-process, because we haven\u2019t announced exact dollar figures and exact dates yet. My anticipation is virtually everything there on the shadow pipeline will move up to the top, to the in-process over the next six months to nine months.","Michael Mueller - JP Morgan","Got it. Okay, that was it. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Okay. Well, thank you very much for joining us and again, for those of you that still have pending questions, feel free to reach out to any of us and we are happy to address any of your questions.","Thank you for joining us and those of you that joined us on the property tour of FOC, next time you\u2019re in Chicago it\u2019s a five minute quick trip on your layover to hop over and take a look at the real live thing. We really did open it. It really is occupied and it really is doing good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"13993":["The Macerich Company (NYSE:MAC) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 31, 2012  1:30 PM ET","Executives","Jean Wood, Vice President, Investor Relations","Arthur Coppola - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer","Edward Coppola - President","Thomas O'Hern - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Robert Perlmutter - Executive Vice President, Leasing","Analysts","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Ben Yang - Evercore Partners","Operator","Welcome to The Macerich Company third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. During the course of this call management will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to uncertainties and risks, associated with our business and industry.","For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the company's press release and SEC filing. As this call will be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that the passage of time can render information stale and you should not rely on the continued accuracy of this material.","During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that defined by the SEC Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the press release and a supplemental 8-K filing for the quarter which are posted in the Investor Section of the company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman of the Board; Ed Coppola, President; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive VP, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O'Hern","Thank you, Jean. Welcome everyone. First of, I'd like to say our thoughts and prayers are going out to those of you that have been affected by Hurricane Sandy. From our end, we're mobilizing all our malls in the region with the Red Cross to help with the recovery where we can. Fortunately, we have sustained no material damage at our malls.","Today, we'll be discussing the third quarter results, capital activity and our outlook for the balance of the year. It was another strong quarter for us in terms of the fundamentals in our business. Retail sales had a strong increase and we saw very significant increases in occupancy up to 93%, which is a 190 basis point increase from a year ago. The leasing volumes were good. We signed 247,000 square feet of mall shop leases in the quarter. And we the average re-leasing spread was a positive 18.5%.","If you look at occupancy, sequentially compared to June 30, we're also up, we're at 92.7% at the end of June and then we're at 93.0% at the end of September. Occupancy cost as a percent of sales for the trailing 12 months was at 12.6% that compared to 13% a year ago.","Looking now at results of operations for the quarter, adjusted FFO was $0.78 a share, up from $0.75 a year ago. Same-center net operating income excluding termination revenue SFAS 141 was up 2.6%.","Negatively impacting the quarter were lease termination revenues, which decreased by $3.2 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Also negatively impacting the quarter on a comparative basis was the reduction in SFAS 141 revenue, which was $1.9 million decrease from the third quarter of last year.","Management company expenses were up for the quarter at $20.7 million compared to $20 million, but they're flat year-to-date at $66.9 million compared to $67 million for the same period in 2011. Other income has been up this year compared to last. In each of the last three quarters we've been averaging about $11 million a quarter in this category, which is mostly our business initiatives and includes garage and parking income, advertising income, sponsorship income, interest income, gift card income and a variety of other miscellaneous items.","Looking at our balance sheet, our total debt-to-market cap for the quarter at quarter-end was 38.3%. Our interest coverage ratio was very healthy 2.85 times. We continue to be in a situation to be able to take advantage of the great financing markets. There is a significant amount of capacity and obviously the rates are fantastic.","As a result of this market, we began the year with an average debt maturity of 3.2 years, as a result of the refinancing and the debt reduction as of September 30. We've extended the average maturity to 4.2 years, and by yearend we expect the average debt maturity to be over six years.","In addition, most of the loans we've been putting in place for long-term fixed rate loans, and the excess proceeds are being used to pay down our line of credit and other floating rate debt. Our floating rate debt at September 30 was 23.6% of our total debt and that's down from 28.2% at the beginning of the year. I would expect that trend to continue as we move forward with the financings planned for the fourth quarter.","We have $1.5 billion line of credit, and as of September 30, only $255 million was outstanding on that line. Looking at the recent capital activity, in August and September, we sold 2.9 million shares of common stock under our ATM program. The average share price for those sales was $60.06 and the net proceeds were a little over $176 million.","As we mentioned in the press release this morning, we have arranged for a $600 million financing in Queens Center. This is a 12-year fixed rate loan. The interest rate has been locked at 3.487%. This loan is interest only, no amortization. The loan proceeds will go to pay off the existing $317 million loan that bears interest at 7.3%.","The closing is expected in December and our pro rata share of excess proceeds will be approximately $135 million. We've also committed to $205 million loan on Deptford Mall. This is a 10-year fixed rate financing and the expected interest rate will be approximately 3.75%.","In September, we also financed Westside Pavilion, again a 10-year fixed rate loan with an interest rate of 4.49%, and that was a $155 million financing. And in September, we also put a $110 million loan on Chesterfield Towne Center. That asset had been previously unencumbered, so that was $110 million of additional liquidity that came in during the quarter.","To date, we've close $1.1 billion in financings at our pro rata share and another $500 million is expected to close before yearend. On the recently announced $1.25 billion acquisition of Kings Plaza and Green Acres, we are anticipating putting a $500 million loan on Kings Plaza and $275 million to $300 million worth of loan on Green Acres, both of which will be long-term fixed rate financings.","We recently on October 25 announced an increase in our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased to $0.58 per share for quarter, that's a 5.5% increase over the prior dividend. In this morning's earnings release, we gave additional confirmation of the FFO guidance range of $306 million to $314 million, that range is unchanged.","Looking now at tenant sales. Small tenant sales per square foot came in at $511 for the portfolio at September 30. That was up 9.4% from the 12 months ended September 30, 2011. If you look sequentially at June, and if you exclude North Park Center from the June numbers and compare those to September, we had a 2.6% increase in just that one quarter in sales per foot.","At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Art.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks Tom, I just want to echo our thoughts and prayers on folks on the east coast. I know that it was devastating. All of our properties are open for business today, with the exception of Freehold which has a power issue.","We anticipate that will be open shortly. And again, we are mobilized that each of the properties to provide help with the recovery efforts, and we'll do everything that we can to assist in that regard.","If you take a look at what we are reporting to you this quarter, you will see that it is a precise reflection of what we laid out for you in my shareholders letter to you, 18 months ago in March of 2011. We've extended our maturities. We've lowered our debt levels. We've sold non-core assets, and we've invested into our core markets. We've increased our productivity of the portfolio, and increased the focus of the portfolio, what I feel is great discipline.","On the operation side, you can see that sales continue to be very strong, that occupancies are very good, leasing spreads continue to be very strong. We're very optimistic on the leasing side.","We have had continued good progress on a number of fronts on the leasing side. And on the operating side of the business, even though, I'm sure that a lot of the discussion today will be balance sheet dispositions and acquisitions, I want to reemphasize that the operating side of our business is extremely strong. I've seen some people right recently about the possibility as this month sales, the rate of increase declined a little bit or not, that's really irrelevant. You need to understand that our retailers are making commitments for 10 years. Maybe we care less what happened this month or last month.","Bottom line is, as we're focused on recently I think by Green Street, which we've been talking about for two years, operating margins are excellent. And that's the key number. They're making money. They're making deals.","And you have the global retailers, now are getting shy, as well as the U.S. retailers of their expansion plans around the globe in Europe and Asia. And they're refocused here in the U.S. And that reflects itself, a lot of the activity that we have seen and that we're seeing. So I can't tell you how bullish, I am about the portfolio today, about our business today. And very happy about the addition of the new assets that we've added.","On the sales front, I'd like to point out just a few statistics and trends. Year-to-date sales in our top 10 centers are up roughly 9%. Our next 25 centers were up roughly 8%. Our top 40 centers overall are up 8%. And then our next 20 centers year-to-date are up just over between 3% and 4%.","So that's exactly what you would anticipate. The most productive centers continue to get better at an increasing rate, and the more mediocre centers just have slower growth rates that reflect itself in leasing spreads at the bottom tier, as well as at the upper tier. The upper tier you get better leasing spreads, the bottom tier you don't get the same leasing spreads. But we're seeing good growth even in our bottom 20 assets or as some people would call them, our B-assets. And a lot of that growth is driven by occupancy and also just scarcity of opportunity for the retailer.","At quarter-end our top 40 centers in our portfolio generated about $571 per square foot, and generated about 78% of NOI. When you bring Kings Plaza and Green Acres into the portfolio and into the top 40 which is more of our land, then that takes our top 40 centers will have sales, of say, closer to $580 a foot.","And the NOI generated from those top 40 centers will be somewhere in the low 80s, 83%, 84%. So as we've outlined you in the past, our goal is to have over 90% of our net NOI coming from what we consider to be core centers, fortress centers. And we're making great strides in that front, increasing our ownership of FlatIron and buying Kings and Green Acres are certainly good steps along the way.","Next, I want to talk about dispositions, and then acquisitions and then developments and then we'll open it up for questions. On the disposition side, we gave you guidance last quarter that we anticipated that the full year dispositions would be roughly $450 million. And that's what they ended up to be.","With the primary disposition in this quarter being the sale of our financial interest in North Park Mall in Dallas. A little bit about North Park Mall in Dallas. We brought into that center with the $75 million investment in 2004. At the time that we went into it, throughout that period time and today, we are bound by confidentiality agreement with the family that owns it. And so we do have some limits on what we can discuss. But let me give you the details of what we can discuss in history.","We went into the property with the $75 million investment with a preferred return on that investment that protected us from development risk, and also with an internal rate of preferred return that was to be paid to us, if and when, earned then also, if and when, our partner were to decide to buy us out. ","The partner has the right limit in this year to consider buying us out and to do that they will require to pay us a fix price, which was essentially our original investment plus an amount of cash equal to that amount to get us to 9.625% internal rate of return.","We had a hope certificate when we went into the deal that it would emerge into a total operating position. It didn't work out that way. We've never managed that center. We've never leased the center. And while the optics of having it in our numbers, the $15 which affected our sales numbers by roughly $15 a square foot which is why our sales are $511 instead of $526, give or take at quarter-end. The opportunity to de-lever by almost $300 million, and take the money off the table was attractive to us.","We do have certain ongoing rights as the consequence of our original agreement and should the owner of that center decide, they want to bring an equity partner in the future, we do have certain rights to first refusal over them. But again, from our view point it was a good financial investment. It was a something that was a very good hope certificate. It did not worked out to be a full co-management and co-operating partnership.","We don't have any other partnership agreements that have that type of provision. It was, again, a preferred equity possession which I think you've heard us say at different times in the past.","Looking to the acquisitions that we've done. I want to layout for you exactly how we have, in fact, already financed the acquisition of Kings Plaza and Green Acres and the 75% interest in FlatIron's mall. Kings Plaza and Green Acres have a total acquisition price of $1.25 billion. Our acquisition of our 75% interest that we did not own in FlatIron mall was roughly $323 million. So let's say, that's $1.575 billion. Here is how we are financing that or have financed that.","There was $127 million of our pro-rata share of debt that we assumed in the purchase of our partners interest at FlatIron. There was roughly $800 million of new debt, about $500 million on Kings that we are about to circle at a sub 4% interest rate. And probably $300 million give or take maybe more on Green Acres.","So there is $800 million of property level debt that will have term of between seven and 10 years on the two different loans probably seven at Kings and 10 years at Green Acres, that will finance that portion of it. So property level debt is $925 million, give or take. That leaves you with the $650 million component to fund in the equity of these acquisitions. Here is how we funded that.","We raised $170 million through the equity issuance under our ATM. We raised $245 million as our pro-rata share of equity from the dispositions that we did this year.","We will be receiving roughly $140 million as our pro-rata share of excess proceeds from the Queens refinance. And we raised roughly $110 million, but let's say we used $95 million of it in the encumbering of an unencumbered asset, Chesterfield Mall. You add that to $170 million on the ATM, the $245 million on the equity from the dispositions, the Queens refinancing excess proceeds, and the Chesterfield Mall encumbering the asset, that totaled $650 million. And that is exactly how we financed it.","Now what's the impact on our earnings? If you take a look at the equity at the centers that we sold, which had $245 million of equity, $466 million in total.","On a full year run rate, that $245 million would have been approximately $0.10 per share diluted. If we had taken that $245 million and basically just paid off our line of credit debt that has a pay rate, of say, 2% or so and we had roughly in FFO yield on the $245 million of equity that we raised of just north of eight, that comes to about $0.10 a share dilutive.","Because the dispositions were done during the course of the year how much is the impact on 2012, probably let's say $0.05 a share or $0.06 a share something in that neighborhood.","Tom will be able to not on this call, but in one-on-one meetings and even by phone give you much more precise guidance on that specific number. Dispositions are always dilutive to earnings. I don't see them as dilutive to NAV, if you see that you got a full price, but they are always dilutive to earnings in this environment. It was roughly $0.10 a share.","When you add up exactly how we financed this transaction, and the equity cost of our ATM equity, the FFO that we lost on the equity of the dispositions, and the interest rate on the debt that we're putting on to the properties that we bought, as well as the debt that we used to finance the balance of the transaction from the Queens refinance and the Chesterfield financing. We not only claw back the entire full year run rate of $0.10 per share dilution, but we add $0.10 a share of accretion.","So from an earnings view point that's very attractive to be able to have fully financed on a long-term basis, including equity and dispositions, the transaction, and also have an earnings benefit, that on a full-year run rate going forward after deducting the full-year run rate of dilution on the equity dispositions is $0.10 a share accretive.","This is precisely what we told you we were going to do 18 months ago that we were going to recycle money out of non-core assets and into core assets.","You might ask me a question, why do I consider North Park to be a non-core asset. It was non-core, because we didn't operate it. We didn't lease it. We didn't manage it.","Our partner was very proprietary about that. We didn't get any of the platform synergies from it. That's what made it non-core. Again, we had a debenture depicted on, but that didn't work out.","So we're very pleased with how we in fact financed these transactions. I'm very pleased with the opportunity to buy back our interest from our partner in FlatIron.","Now, I know there is probably a cynic on this call that's going to say, oh, you brought in that partner and they put up $120 million or so to get into the deal, and now you paid them $196 million.","Three years later, well, guess what, I would do that all day long. Remember, when we brought in our partner into FlatIron and Queens and Chandler and Freehold with Heitman, we did that in lieu of doing what everybody else in the universe was doing, which was selling survival equity. To raise that same $120 million that our partner put into FlatIron's three years ago, we would have had to sold 10 million shares of stock back then to raise that same money.","The way that I see it, we are looking at being basically today with $195 million that we used to buy them out at today's stock price, we saved the issuance at roughly 7 million shares of stock and in today's stock price, the way I see it, we're around $400 million ahead on that one deal alone. And the same math applies to Queens, and the same math applies to Chandler and Freehold.","So I am very pleased to bring this back into a wholly-owned category. We have great hopes for FlatIron. We have a retenanting plan where we're looking to relocate JC Penney from a mall that is headed in the wrong direction to the South of us down in Westminster and bring Penney up to our mall and we are repositioning the outdoor village, not at a lot of money, it's around $10 million, $15 million max total we do, but we think that the center is definitely on an up tick and we're pleased about it.","Turning to Kings and to Green Acres, in particular and what our thinking is there. We're just thrilled with the opportunity to add Kings and Green Acres to our portfolio.","When I thought about and have talked about wanting to increase our presence in the New York markets and the Washington DC markets, there were two centers that came to mind as being really the two centers that we would have loved to have added in the New York market. And we were able to make this deal to buy Kings and Green Acres and we're just thrilled.","We have a tremendous track record in the boroughs in New York. Besides owning Queens, we also manage a center in Yonkers. And it's a fabulous market.","We see the opportunity at Kings to do something along the lines of what we did at Queens. When we bought Queens it was doing $600 a square foot, and before we ever did any expansion of the center, we went through a re-leasing process where we took the tenants that were underperforming. And we replaced them with tenants that performed better than their mall average. And over the course of the next five years or so we raised the sales at Queens Center from $600 a foot to $1,000 a foot just through a recycling of tenants and going from unproductive to productive.","We see the opportunity to do something along the same lines at Kings. It is a fabulous market. It has a lot of the density characteristics that we enjoyed at Queens. It has a further opportunity. Beyond the fact that whether it's an opportunity to do some remerchandising here, you also have a functionally obsolete department store with Sears. It's over 330,000 square feet. And they've already indicated that they would like to downsize dramatically.","So the opportunities there is to have a conversation with them, to recycle a significant amount of space there, possibly as much as half of their space, either into shop space or into the addition of another anchor or whether the anchor be a department store, a theater and or shops.","We're going to be very patient about Kings. The first step is going to be the remerchandising of unproductive tenants into productive tenants. But the opportunity there is really quite significant and its nice, because we can do it all within the four walls of the property because you have that 339,000 foot box of the Sears building that we have reason to believe and conversations with them, that they want to reduce in size. And then we're going to recycle that into more productive tenants. So we are just really thrilled about that.","Occupancy costs at Kings are roughly 19% of sales. The answer to that is the increased sales by bringing in more productive tenants. Every year that we've own Queens Center, whether it was doing $600 a foot or $1,000 a foot, occupancy costs at Queens Center have been 20% of sales. The key is to bring in more productive tenants. And the other opportunity is to recycle some department store space to shops space that pays you real rent.","Green Acres is also an opportunity, but on a different scale. It's more of a suburban mall obviously than Kings. I like it in some of the centers that we own in the Los Angeles marketplace. We're extremely familiar with how to do business in markets like this.","There is an opportunity here at Green Acres to take one of the department stores JC Penney, who have some of the highest sales per foot for JC Penney of any Penney store that we have in our portfolio. And they want to get into a new full-line store. And the nice thing is that the space that they occupied really is mall shop space.","It's right on the 50-yard line on the mall and the opportunity there would be to expand then possibly outboard, convert their store into shop space. Maybe even dream a little bit and add a second level, and connect it into the existing one anchor second level that's got a food court and is only anchored by Sears. So then you'd have a fully two-anchored second level that would have both Sears and Penney on it. We see a lot of upside there.","We entered with Green Acres in 1995 when Vornado bought and they ended up buying it back then. Green Acres today does $800 million of total business on campus. Now to put that into comparison, North Park in Dallas and Tysons and centers like that, those are numbers like those types of centers in terms of total business.","Obviously, it's coming from a lot of the big boxes. And not so much from the fancy luxury tenants, but it's still a very productive center. Certainly fits with the category of you would cater to the masses and you eat with the classes. So we're very optimistic about where we're going to head with Kings and Green Acres and we're thrilled to have them in our portfolio.","Turning now to developments. There has also been some folks that said, maybe that's Macerich between their development pipeline and now this new acquisition. What are they going to do about their balance sheet?","First of all as, Tom pointed out, our balance sheet from maturity schedule view point has gotten significantly stronger over the past few months. And it is going to continue to get stronger from the view point of floating rate debt versus fixed with any ratio you want, debt- to-EBITDA, any ratio, coverage ratios it is much stronger after these acquisitions than it was even at the beginning of the year.","Looking at our development pipeline to remind you the imminent development pipeline that is unfunded is only roughly $250 million, which is our share of the development at Tysons Corner. And you may remember that I pointed out to you on our last call that we have at loan at Tysons Corner in coming due February of 2014, which only has a balance of $300 million on it.","So the idea of completely repatriating the dollars that we and our partner Alaska Permanent Fund are putting into Tysons Corner in 16 months or so is certainly there and our partner is amenable to such an idea, so that is very manageable.","Looking to Tysons Corner and the development itself. I'm pleased to announce today that we have signed on with Hyatt Regency for them to come in and operate and use the Hyatt Regency flag at the hotel component that we are adding to the property. They are very bullish on the prospects there. And there will be a separate press release that will be coming out of the organizations, either today or tomorrow that will point that out.","I'm also pleased to report to you that we're making significant progress on the leasing of the office tower. I would not at all be surprised, if before we report to you in our next quarterly earnings call, three months from now. I would not at all be surprised to have announced to you that over half of that building has been leased to one or two significant tenants","So we're making very good progress there. So I think the idea that once the infrastructure gets up to the podium level, sometime in the spring of next year, the idea that we continue to go completely vertical is most likely in the cards, and on an office tower of this nature once you've got 50%, 60% leased, the rest of the tenants really kind of fill quite nicely.","So we're very pleased about where we stand on that. Fashion Outlets of Chicago, the leasing remains terrific. We're not re-leasing the names of tenants, maybe even until the opening. But I can assure you the quality of the merchandise mix there is going to be second to few.","August 1, it's a grand opening date. We're in line on budget. And I'd point out to you that the equity that we're putting into the Fashion Outlets of Chicago has already been funded. That's what frames the construction loan. The construction loan will be used to fund the balance of it, so that it does not have any development overhang.","We're very happy to announce also on Chicago at North Bridge Mall, the addition of Eataly to our projects. The Eataly will be occupying space, just off of Rush Street in location across the street from Nordstrom basically. Its 60,000 feet, it's even larger than the Eataly that you know in New York.","The owners and sponsors of Eataly, or the Farinetti family and others and Mario Batali are extremely bullish about the prospects in Chicago. Local folks in Chicago, real estate folks and otherwise firmly believe that this is going to have a significant shift of the balance of traffic down towards our side of Michigan Avenue more southerly section of Michigan Avenue.","And it even further bolsters our decision to open up North Bridge to Rush Street by creating a new opening, soon over the next six months and a new escalator up in the center court there that will advantage off of the current traffic that we have off our Rush Street and that will drive traffic in more than one way in to the mall.","Right now, we only have significant traffic coming off of Michigan Avenue, but this will give us another level of traffic off of Rush, which is actually one level below upper Michigan Avenue. And we're very bullish about that.","While everything that we're doing in connection with Eataly and the escalator court and everything else, is going to have great impact on the center. But it's not a lot of money. Our share of the CapEx for that alone is less than $10 million, big bank for our buck, not a lot of money. So we're very pleased about where we stand, right there.","Then, just kind of getting back to what Macerich does every day. We had an opening during post this quarter close on October 5 of a relocated JC Penney store at Victor Valley Mall in the High Desert in Victorville, California. It's an interesting center. It does $459 a foot, in spite of the fact that over the last couple of years, it's been operating with two vacant department stores. But as part of a repositioning plan there, we relocated Penney from 50,000 feet small store to 100,000 feet give or take. They had seven stores open this fall, including some in urban locations, big cities and they tell us that the particular store at Victor Valley was the best performing store of the seven that opened.","We can see it already from the traffic that the community loves it. And we fully anticipate that when we take the other vacant store, which is currently under construction, which was an old Gottschalks, and we bring out a more fashion for that market, store at Macy's to replace them which will open up in March of 2013.","We think that this center will easily surpass $500 a square foot. That's an example of taking a B-Mall and turning it into A-Mall, if you're going to measure it by sales per foot, similar to what we did at Modesto and Fresno, the types of things that we do every day here.","So with that I would like to open it up for questions, and welcome you to this call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Just a question on North Park, just want to understand what the income statement impact is in terms, I recognize the $75 million was a preferred investment. What were you actually accruing in terms of NOI within the unconsolidated joint venture statement, was it just a preferred return on the $75 million or were you actually earning 50% of the NOI?","Thomas O'Hern","The FFO impact was based on our equity investment and it was approximating $10 million a year.","Arthur Coppola","It had nothing to do with the NOI. It was related to the preferred return, I believe, right Tom?","Thomas O'Hern","Yes.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","I think there was some investor concern that from an NAV perspective that your NAV, you would have been ticking up 50% of the NOI, but clearly on the implied sales price for an asset of that stature, it would imply something much less. So what you are saying is the NOI that was being derived was off of a $75 million base and some fix percentage of that rather than 50% of the NOI.","Thomas O'Hern","The bottom line impact was $10 million over the last couple of years as the investment grew over $100 million. So roughly 9.65% return on that amount.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","There was $163 million of debt, right?","Thomas O'Hern","There was also a kicker on top of that debt that could have been as much as $75 million to $80 million.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And then in terms of FlatIron, I completely agree selling assets at that point was much, much better than selling stock. I just want to make sure I understand the dynamics in terms of the yield that you're buying backing at, I assume there has been some growth in NOI. Is it fair to assume that the buyback was at about 6.5 cap?","Thomas O'Hern","Closer to 6. Partner buybacks are difficult to talk about, but you're in the zip code, but it's closer to 6.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And then it was extraordinarily helpful, Art, as you went through the sources and uses. I guess from an ATM perspective you talked about what was done in the third quarter. I assume that means nothing within the fourth quarter or you continue to tap that?","Arthur Coppola","We've done nothing in the fourth quarter.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And then as you think going forward, clearly just as sources and uses, there was more debt in getting excess proceeds. Do you think about adding more equity to the base or you feel comfortable where you are today going forward?","Arthur Coppola","If you roll through pro forma and factor in the acquisition of Kings Plaza and Green Acres, we're comfortable where we're at. The debt-to-market cap is about 45%.","As we said that average maturity schedule gets pushed way out to over six years and the debt-to-EBITDA is in the high-sevens, low-eights. All levels we are comfortable with.","On the hand I will say, that when we announced earlier in January that we were going to be disposing at non-core assets, at the time it was really intended to recycle capital predominantly into our portfolio whether it was going to be into the redevelopment pipeline, the development pipeline, reducing leverage, just focusing on our core opportunities.","The opportunity through these acquisitions to effectively have recycled that money from dispositions directly into a home, turned out to be terrific for us. Look I'm not a big fan of creating earnings accretion through cheap debt. It's just a fact function of the math. But the fact that we did also use a fair amount of equity as part of consummating transaction between the equity and ATM equity, and the real estate equity is over $400 million of equity that was recycled into these acquisitions.","So they were completely levered up. However, our goal remains the same. We can never have too much equity and we can never too little debt. We can never have too much core assets and we can never have to view non-core assets.","So the idea of continuing to opportunistically go ahead and think about recycling somewhat of what we considered to be our non-core assets, which will include malls that we might consider, somewhat considered to be B Malls and even Cs, they'd be even in A over the course of this next year is clearly something that we will consider. And when you're sitting on $0.10 a share of forward-looking and when you really look at the acquisition as a total, if you got the $0.10 by clawing back, the $0.10 of dilution it's really $0.20, when you really do the math of the acquisitions.","There is an opportunity to do continued dispositions, which will take debt off the balance sheet, raise equity to reduce further debt, improve the ratios and still have a decent amount of accretion from this activity and have an even stronger balance sheet and then we're going to continue to do it. There are no further dispositions planned that will happen this year. There are clearly dispositions that are being looked at in the near term.","Operator","And we'll take our next question come from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","So basically, when you were talking about the non-core sales last quarter, you maybe didn't expected, but that actually included North Park and not a lot of the other sort of B-Malls that you have talked about going to being in a bottom 20 of your centers?","Arthur Coppola","It includes both. In beginning of the year, it was primarily the other stuff. As the year went on, when we raised our guidance level on dispositions are began to North Park. But that was still up for debate as to whether or not that was going to be disposed up.","But clearly considered North Park to have been our non-core, in fact the factor because we didn't manage it, we didn't release it, and we didn't get any synergies from it, we didn't control it. It was just a financial investment. It had a big hope certificate. And you know what, I would do that with South Coast Plaza and Bellevue Square and centers of that nature all-day along. ","I would make the same investments with the hope certificate that it became a real pursuit, it did not. It is what it is. The opportunity to recycle $300 million of debt and equity back into opportunities for Kings and Green Acres and owning all the FlatIron worked out terrific for us.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","And then on Tysons last quarter you talked about March or April being the next drop where there could be kind of more focused, go, no-go decisions. And based on your comments today, it sounds like and at least in two of the three components that it continues to lean more towards a go at that point?","Thomas O'Hern","Well, the only thing that was potentially going to be paused was the office tower. The platform that gets build and believe me this is a one dimensional communication and it's a three dimensional project. So I know it's probably hard to imagine. But we're doing all of the sub-terrain infrastructure right now, which includes couple thousand sub-terrain parking spaces.","We build it up to a platform which is two acres of a Plaza up in the air that is above the ring road, above the parking lot, speeds into metro link and speeds into the second level of the mall, and then sitting on top of that is the hotel and the residential tower, and the office tower.","The hotel is a go, it's Hyatt Regency. We're very happy about that. The residential is a go. The thing that I mentioned before in terms of the phasing of the construction was that our go or no-go decision. We would have to make that decision in the spring, March, April or May to have it continue to be on exactly the same schedule as the others.","My prognosis and the thing that would drive it is if you are more than 50% leased or you feel really good about the leasing, which is really a lead tenant or two.","Today I'm much more optimistic, well that can change, about where we stand on the leasing. And again I would not at all be surprised if we were to make an announcement before our next earnings call that would show that we're more than half leased, that we have anchor tenants there, that would cause us to continue with the office tower.","And in fact the result of all that is that the office tower opens before any of the three towers. It opens up I think in the spring of '14 and then I think the hotel and the residential tower come mid and then late '14. We're very, very bullish about where we see our conversations on the leasing and the office side.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Then just lastly, do you have the regional sales growth?","Arthur Coppola","Yes, we do.","Thomas O'Hern","Yes, regional sales growth was 17% in Arizona; 6.7% in the east; 11% in California, Northern California and Pacific Northwest 11%; Southern California 10.8%; and Central region on a comp basis excluding North Park up 8.2%.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nathan Isbee with Stifel Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","Art, just going back to your comment before about the pro forma debt-to-EBITDA in the high sevens to low eight, is that including all the development projects and redevelopments you have teamed up?","Thomas O'Hern","No, that's as of January this year we closed on Green Acres. Obviously, the developments don't stretch the value as much as an outright acquisition, because obviously we're looking at strong returns in the 8% to 10% range and value substantially lower than 6%. So there is kind of built-in equity there.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","So you're comfortable even with all that activity?","Thomas O'Hern","Well, obviously, the developments will temporarily until they come online and start. Servicing debt will increase debt-to-EBITDA slightly. But on the other hand, you've got the disposition effort that Art mentioned, that we expect to be ongoing. And we're not done with that initiative of selling non-core assets and redeploying capital. That will be going on as well.","Arthur Coppola","The method involve here outright dispositions, it could also involve the possibility of allowing somebody to co-invest with us on a partnership level on certain assets.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","On the Kings Plaza, when you talked about the efforts there to take the sales from the $650 up to the Queens Center type levels. Kings Plaza clearly it's in good asset, but has not had a lot of money put into it for many years, both interior and exterior. Can you talk about what type of dollars you might have to spend there just to get those sales to attract those types of tenants?","Arthur Coppola","The truth of the matter is you don't have to spend anything to do the day-to-day re-leasing that we do to increase the productivity. We took the sales at Queens Center in the first five years of ownership from $600 to $1,000 a foot, and didn't put a penny into it. And it was pretty old and beat up too.","So look it's a great opportunity to give it a fresh face. Do I think it's a Queens Center in terms of $1,000 a foot center? No. But I think it's got the opportunity to have, at least a couple $100 a foot in productivity increases, which isn't so bad, especially when you also have the opportunity to potentially increase the mall shop GLA by recapturing anchor spaces.","It's what we do every day. It's taking big spaces that defensively got leased to big boxes, and carving out into smaller spaces. It's recycling functionally obsolete huge anchors. I mean 339,000 feet, four levels for an anchor store is ridiculously big. And recycling that square footage, it's what we do every day. And it doesn't involve having to buy any more land, building. It's all within the four walls of the building.","We have taken a look at some numbers. And we actually have a plan to, one of them to recycle about half of the Sears building into shops and\/or anchor space, and freshen up the mall and I think that plan is in the $50 million to $75 million neighborhood total.","But the returns on that, which are not in our acquisition numbers, because we don't control recapture of facilities, we're mid-teens cash-on-cash. Our development money that we spend because it has a high hurdle, especially when you're buying a center that has not been brought up to date.","And we know centers that have not been brought up to date also, just to let you know. We try and stay ahead of the curve. But you spend the money, when it makes sense to spend the money. You don't spend the money just to be spending the money. The time to spend the money is part of an anchor repositioning. And then you'll completely reinvent the center.","So that five years from now, you could walk into Kings Plaza with a blindfold on compared to today and you wouldn't recognize it, I'd totally believe that, totally believe that.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","So it's safe to say that any significant work there would be coupled with some activity on the Sears space?","Arthur Coppola","Well, that's a big opportunity. But on the other hand there is lots of low hanging fruit. But what we do and that's not a criticism of the former owner.","Look we bought Queens from somebody that was a pro. We bought Santa Monica Place from the Rouse Company, they were pros. Anytime a new owner comes in that has a vision that's different from the old owners vision, and the vision can be made to reality. And it was a good idea. We make a lot of money. We generally that's what we look for when we buy.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus","And then focusing on Green Acres for a minute is that an asset that you clearly want to own long-term or is it more that it came along in the package and you're evaluating your options with it?","Thomas O'Hern","We had a conversation with the owners of Vornado a year ago, and they own more than just Kings in Green Acres. If you were to told me a year later that we were able to get control of Kings and Green Acres, I would have said, boy, that was a good years of work. We're very happy with the outcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Spector with Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","I wanted to focus on operating metrics specifically same-store NOI. I'm not sure how much you can say or not but when I look at the increase in sales per square foot over the last seven or eight quarters, and the last time you reported occupancy costs to sales, it seems like there was a big opportunity here to push same-store NOI over the next 12, 24 months. I don't know how much you can talk about that?","Thomas O'Hern","Jeff, the re-leasing spreads really relate, and I'd given here to about 8% to 10% on the portfolio. So if you were to have a positive spread of in this case, 18%, you have to multiply that by 10%. You know you're going to pick up 1.5% to 1.8% on your same-store NOI line. So it's certainly a key part of that. But given the trends it would indicate that the sales are going up faster because just we can get only get our hands on 10% of that space in a given year, but it does bode well for the future.","Arthur Coppola","Let me answer it a little more granularly. We just came through a budget meeting with the executive team and with Bobby Perlmutter who is with us now. And actually a lot of you will be meeting him at NAREIT. So that will be great.","And so we have great visibility into each asset. And we're very bullish about the activity we have. I don't care if it's Queens, Corte Madera, North Bridge. I'm bullish on Tysons Corner. Those are great things happening in Washington Square, Santa Monica Place, we're doing some terrific things. Cerritos, Kierland Commons, Broadway Plaza on the development side, Arrow Head Fashion Fair, Fresno, I mean I go through each and every center.","And I see great activity levels. Now, when we don't see great activity levels and we just see flatness and stability or even a downward trend, those are the ones we're going to be exposing to the disposition market. But the keepers, the ones that are in that top 85% to 90% of NOI, on a granular basis, I could spend 30 minutes on every asset with you, and talk to you about what we see in the next year or two.","So yes, we see great same-center NOI. It's up to us to produce it. And we can't do it to meet quarterly expectations, because we're always thinking about the bigger issue, which is value creation. So we're patient about how we do it.","You have the day-to-day stuff that we're doing it every one of our centers. I do think there is some opportunities at the acquired centers. There is an opportunity at FlatIron that I mentioned earlier in the call. And then you add to that bringing online Fashion Outlets of Chicago in August, which is going to be just a huge hit. We're very optimistic about where it will be on that and obviously we'll be giving you guidance for next year on the next call.","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","Sorry, if I missed this, but did you discuss I guess development specifically given the high sales increase again in Arizona?","Arthur Coppola","We talked about the development that are underway which is Tysons and Fashion Outlets of Chicago, where there is real money being spent. Other than that we talked about a lot of action going on in North Bridge, but not a lot of money.","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","So nothing else new?","Thomas O'Hern","No.","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","I wanted to ask an update on Santa Monica Place, I just heard, Art, you mentioned it quickly. I guess any new updates there?","Arthur Coppola","It's going to be one by one. There is a lot of activity going on. I can tell you that it's in the second generation of leasing as I've said before. It's unusual for a new center to be in the second generation two years in. It's not unusual for a great new center to be in the second generation, because within two years it becomes really obvious what concepts are working and what concepts are not. And then Darvin takes over and the productive guys come in and they pretty much force their way in to take over the unproductive guys with our systems.","Jeffrey Spector - Merrill Lynch","And then, my last question, I'm not sure if you can answer this. But, just to give us a feel for Kings Plaza, Green Acres performance, can you mention how their sales the sales trend there over the last 12 months?","Thomas O'Hern","They've been similar to our portfolio and they're on positive sales trends at both.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Just curious more broadly what you guys are hearing in general from the tenants out there especially for the regional malls, as they look going into the holiday season here, and then into next year as well?","Arthur Coppola","They're making capital commitments. They want to grow their business. Nobody knows where Christmas and Holiday sales are going to be until December 31st. I don't need to be trying about, but it's just, we get this question every year and I don't know.","But if you look at the prospects for the next year to two years, to five years, to ten years, they're bullish as they can be. I do hear some anecdotal evidence that those that you can measure on the department store side are increasing their hiring to have more staff on the floor in anticipation of greater sales. But you know what it's going to be what it's going to be.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Do you sense any change?","Thomas O'Hern","Can you tell me who is going to win the election?","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","I'll take a shot at that, but I will not do it here. The thing is, I'm in Ohio and listen my vote is open for sale. What I was thinking more about is from last quarter to this quarter is there any change. I mean are they accelerating the way their positive thought process or maybe gotten little more cautious?","Arthur Coppola","Sure. Bobby is here. Bobby Perlmutter you want to comment on the leasing side, Bobby?","Robert Perlmutter","I'd say it's a general role. We see the market continuing to improve. I think generally people think it will be a good, but not great holiday season. I think one of the real positive trends is some of the companies with larger fleets are really more focused in the BB plus category for their expansion, which is probably a significant improvement over the last couple of years.","But we look at our biggest tenants and our biggest tenants generally their business is good and when their business is good, they open more stores and in particular gap, who is a large tenant for everybody seems to have stabilized significantly over last 12 months.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","So if we think about year-end occupancy, where are you thinking, I guess, year-end occupancy for this year?","Thomas O'Hern","The occupancy always moves up a little but at year-end. Last year it was 92.7% and that was up from about 92% at the end of the third quarter. So we expect to see that maybe 93.5% something like that, Rich, little bit of tickup in the fourth quarter.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","And then kind of a strange question, we don't have the JV data yet. The depreciation expense in the JV seem to go down substantially which changes of course the FFO based on what the income line is. Is there anything special that happened in I mean in the D&A I guess of the JV line?","Thomas O'Hern","You're saying that JV line went down sequentially or compared to last year?","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Sequentially, exactly.","Thomas O'Hern","I'll have to get back to you on that one, Rich.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Then the last thing I had was the $255 million on your line of credit Tom, are you comfortable leaving a balance on the line or you have some plans I guess to clear it down to zero?","Thomas O'Hern","There's a lot of capital activity Rich. And as we raise cash it will go against the line, obviously going the other direction as we borrow for the development of Tysons.","But certainly we have a lot of capacity above that. It's a $1.5 billion line that we can take to $1.8 billion and we've got less than 300 outstanding at the end of the quarter.","So we're very comfortable with that. Keep in mind the interest rate is about 2% on that, and also keep in mind throughout all these other transactions we keep pushing down the percentage of our floating rate debt in total. And so when you combine all those things we're very comfortable with where we stand on that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from (inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","What was the timing during the quarter of the North Park sale?","Thomas O'Hern","North Park was in mid-August.","Unidentified Analyst","And I know you said that you don't have any structure similar to North Parks in your JVs, but just one question on the Heitman JV, I know there's a repurchase agreement for Macerich seven years when it occurred. Is that a repurchase agreement? Is that a fixed price that's already been negotiated or is that more of after price?","Thomas O'Hern","My recollection is that it's a formula price at a fixed number. Those joint ventures as well as the FlatIron joint ventures had disproportionate shares of income and residuals at times coming to us after the investor saw certainly return. But you're right. We did get the opportunity to have some form of a formula right in that agreement with them. But look they are great partner and they would love to expand their relationships with us. So I don't see that to factor.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc","Just wanted to follow-up on Nath's question from earlier, it looked like from the language filed with regard to the acquisitions that the Green Acres sale was conditioned on the closings of Kings Plaza. But it's a little hard to understand from whose perspective that might be from? It sounds like they both have additional investment opportunities and some upside. Was one of those centers more attractive in your view?","Arthur Coppola","Yes, Kings was a bit more attractive because, there are very few centers that have the opportunity to do something along the lines of what we did with Queens. At Queens, we hit a grand slam four times in the same game. At Kings, we think we've got huge opportunities.","Green Acres is just a real citizen. It's very solid sales over $530 a foot. The total center does $800 a foot. We have a very specific profitable, simple, easy to execute expansion plan that doesn't involve a ridiculous amount of money. And we own plenty of centers in Los Angeles like Lakewood and Stonewood in Downey that are in markets like this that are incredibly dense, high barrier to entry markets where they density protects you on the down side and it also gives you opportunity on the upside.","Which one do I think, has got the opportunity to become an A Plus, A Plus, but Green Acres is a very solid citizen. And it's a type of property that I grew up. And in terms of the tenant mix and the anchor line up, the fundamentals are basically very good there. But the big opportunity is Kings.","And don't forget, and I'm not going to speak for them, but there were different owners of the two centers, two different public companies. So we were happy to transact on both of them and are happy to transact on both of them. And as to any linkage, I would recommend you to talk to the sellers, not to me.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc","And you mentioned that there was minimal damage, if any, at your properties from the hurricane. Any update on Green Acres and Kings Plaza, how they were during the storm?","Arthur Coppola","We were in close contact with the folks there, and they are both opened for business and a nominal damage at each. I'd say they fit into category of a whole bunch of assets as well as lives on the East Coast that things could have been a lot worse. And then, you all know that better than I do, because I wasn't there for it. But I understand natural disasters and we feel for everybody. It could have been a lot worse, just form our own selfish view point.","But at the end of the day, we were closed one to two days at a half of dozen properties, including Kings and Green Acres, which by the way, we don't have a history of announcing acquisitions the time that we put them under contract in definitive agreement. But it's hard to say this, but it was material for the solo, but not material for us. But that's what they told us, so it had to be disclosed.","Todd Thomas - KeyBanc","And then, a question for Tom. In terms of leverage, I get the improvement in fixed charge coverage ratios and the reduction in floating rate debt, and the extension of the average duration of your debt portfolio that's set to improve meaningfully. But the absolute level of leverage is edging higher. And I was just wondering, what specific metric do you focus on for leverage and where are you comfortable taking that to?","Thomas O'Hern","Look, Todd, we don't focus on just one metric, I think that's a mistake. I mean we look at certainly layering out the maturity schedule trying to not have too much rolling in any one year, and that was really the emphasis this year and we've extended that significantly.","Our floating rate debt has come down a lot because we look at that as well, and although today's rates are extremely low that could change pretty quickly. So we're really focused on reducing the floating rate debt level, which is something we look at.","We do look at debt-to-EBITDA, but we realize that's going to move up and down a little bit depending on where we are in the development cycle and where we're with dispositions, and that's done that. I mean at the end of the third quarter debt-to-EBITDA was about 6.9 times, which is unrealistically low. That was after we raised the equity from the ATM and before we'd closed on FlatIron.","After most of this activity, it will be closer to eight times and we're not uncomfortable with that either, given the coverage level. So we look at overall leverage. We look at the maturity schedule. We look at the amount of floating rate debt and we look at debt-to-EBITDA.","Arthur Coppola","I'll try and immune on that. There is again, just one of those, you can never have too much equity and you can never have too little debt. But the most important metrics that has changed for us in the last two to three years and even in the last year is, the impending maturity schedule and the average length of the maturity schedule.","As Tom mentioned, I think you mentioned Tom, that by the end of the year our average maturities will be six years. Those are average maturities of fixed rate loans that are non-recourse at a property level that Tom and his group have been staggering out. We're at the point to where today we sit here and debate with each other over whether or not we have too much debt coming due in the year 2022. And that's a quality problem compared to worrying about how much debt do I have coming due next month or next year.","So we've lengthened out our maturity schedule dramatically. We do have a couple of big maturities coming up next year and the year after, but they aren't great assets. You got Scottsdale Fashion Square, I think is next year, Freehold is a healthy one next year. But the market looks like it does today to increase that non-recourse financing significantly, if you wanted to. And then February of 2014 is probably the most under levered asset that we have. It is a big mortgage of $300 million, but that property can support the mortgage a big multiple of that if it wanted to.","And then, you look at our overall liquidity levels, and we're sitting there with let's say $1 billion over capacity left on our line of credit. But we do have in our ongoing business plan, the idea that we're going to continue to prune our portfolio and pruning our portfolio to me is more important than optics.","So that's why I mentioned earlier on North Park. It was not an operating platform asset and the opportunity to reduce our leverage and repatriate equity to the tune of $300 million at a cost of depressing our sales per square foot that we report to you about $15 a foot. I'll trade the optics for the cash and the lower debt all day long. We're going to continue to do that on the balance of the portfolio.","I want to emphasize, the financing for Green Acres, Kings and FlatIron is done. There is no short-term borrowing plan here. We're not borrowing short to buy long. The equity is permanent equity. The equity from the dispositions is permanent equity. The Queens refinance was 12 years. The Chesterfield was 10 years. The Kings Plaza financing is seven years likely and Green Acres is probably 10.5 years to 11 years, and FlatIron has a loan coming due next year that we can over finance and take a lot of money out of it if we want to.","So I feel very good about where we stand, balance sheet wise. Our goal is just to make them stronger and stronger and stronger, but keep in mind that we are a non-recourse borrower. These are asset level property debts and the maturities have been extended dramatically and the upcoming maturities are extremely light for the foreseeable future.","And our development pipeline is virtually funded on the projects that are underway with the exception of Tysons, you know what that number is, we also told you how that can be repatriated, whether it'd be refinancing Tysons in February of '14 or we may elect to fund it through selling assets in the next six months too. That's a great use of our balance sheet and of our capital.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Just going to Kings Plaza and Green Acres, as you've outlined Kings Plaza, your intension is to bring it to a Queens Center type mall. As you see Green Acres, can you talk about the big sales that generates, do you see that as you think about your redevelopment being more of a big box center or you think it's going to still be a lot of in line? Where do you see more of the growth essentially, adding more big box or adding more in lines?","Thomas O'Hern","It's repositioning Penny to a prototypical store. So right now they've got about 97,000 feet, but it's all in line shop space, and half of it is basement. And in spite of that they're doing the highest sales per foot or any Penny I think that we have in our portfolio. Two stores that Macy's has a Kings and Green Acres rank in the top four Macy stores that we have in our company out of 60 stores.","The Penny store at Green Acres is maybe the highest sales per foot we have in our portfolio. And the Sears, the stores that they have at Green Acres and Kings, both are in the top 10% of the 40-some Sears stores that we own. But the opportunity is to help Penny. They very much want to build a new store there. They see a massive opportunity here for themselves. They see it as one of their top priorities in their company. We talked to Macy's about it, they talked about that store just doing gangbusters, and the special returns are doing $530 a foot.","So the simple opportunity as I see it, is to help Penny look at an expansion in a new building, outboard of their existing building, redemise their existing shops space into more traditional mall retail. And potentially connect that new two level Penny into the existing partial second level, which is only anchored by Sears in the food court and other shops. I don't want to say it's routine, but it's pretty routine is what we do every day. It's fairly sizeable.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","And the Wal-Mart, I forget if that's a super or not, but is that also source of potential improvement or they own their box?","Arthur Coppola","They're a tenant. They lease space.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","So is there upside there to extend their size?","Arthur Coppola","I think there is an expansion and a significant increase in rent that's underway right now and in documentation.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","So, Tom, as you think about financing these, sometimes we hear folks say, if they're going to redevelop assets, your floating rate short term debt as they can improve the NOI before long-term fixing it out. You guys are long-term fixing out. Is there more because of the attractive rates that exist today or is that because of the timing of the redevelopment is uncertain at this point, and therefore it may take several years versus something more in the near term?","Thomas O'Hern","Actually, it's a function of being a very strong borrowers market, Alexander. So rates are good, spreads are good. We're able to build into the documents latitude to do expansions on those space recapture that space. I got to tell you the Queens financing was very, very competitive. We saw the same thing on Deptford. Kings and Green Acres are going to be the same. And we're able to get a fair amount of latitude to get our hands on the asset and redevelop down the road.","Arthur Coppola","Look, if we were closing down the center, like we did at Santa Monica Place, the idea of putting seven-year financing on it, you wouldn't do it. But all the work that we're going to be doing is within the confines of what can be carved out in a new loan and look being able to borrow $500 million at a sub 4% interest rate for seven years give or take at Kings. It takes a lot of interest rate risk off the table. And from the viewpoint of, does it take proceeds five or seven years from now opportunity away from yourself, I would say not so much. And in the meantime I'd rather be locked in and say 3.6% for seven years, and not play the interest rate game.","So we do see huge upside there in terms of what we can do. It will take some time. Realistically, our property like that, it's three to five years give or take. But if the loan would have gotten in the way of the redevelopment and you couldn't carve it out, then you wouldn't put a long-term loan on it. And we've been one of those people that say such a thing. But we think it's just prudent balance sheet strategy to go ahead and take advantage of the proceeds level. We had no maturities to speak of in 2018. We could have gone 10 years. But like I said earlier, we're already beginning to say, alright, we got a lot of stuff coming due 10 years from now because of all the work that we've been doing lately.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Just final question is on Tysons. Can you give some color as to the tenants, are these tenants who are relocating from nearby submarkets or are these tenants who are growing substantially, and therefore need to have new space? Clearly, the story is coming out of DC on the office side have not been too upbeat. So sort of curious, where these tenants are coming from, if they are new to the market, if they are just relocating or if they need to really expand, just a little more color?","Arthur Coppola","Relocation.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","From within DC or within the suburbs?","Arthur Coppola","I'm really not going to get more specifics than that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Not to beat a dead horse, but I just want to be crystal clear on what you're saying. You have no intention to issue any common equity in the next couple of months to either fund the acquisitions you've done or otherwise. Is that what the message you're trying to get across here?","Arthur Coppola","We are fully financed at this point in time, permanently financed. And I'm not going to say anything more than that.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","If I just think about FlatIron, did GI have a put rate? What enabled the timing of that now versus in the future?","Thomas O'Hern","That was very much a financial transaction at the time. They're more of a financial investor than a real estate financial investor or a mall real estate financial investor, a dedicated mall type of partner. So it was a fairly structured deal, where they had the rights after a three-year period. No, that was not a put.","They had the right to look at exposing their position to the marketplace. They did that and along the way we elected to step in and take control of the assets, once they had some clarity as to what the marketplace felt their position was worth. We were already into a significant promote on the property over and above our 25% interest, and that enabled us to buy in at a very attractive rate, which represented part of our promote too.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","So not even quite a buy-sell either?","Thomas O'Hern","There is a buy-sell in every partnership agreement generally that I have ever seen. But that's not what was used here. They just had the right to take their position to the market. And while they were doing that, we were in constant conversations and we elected to go ahead and to take control of the asset. We had to balance that against other opportunities that we're looking at in the marketplace. And when it felt that this was the best place to put our capital, we stepped up and did it.","Operator","And we'll take our next call from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","A quick question, just curious how you guys are thinking about the unsecured market at this point just when I think about all the financing you're doing, a lot of it is basically secured?","Thomas O'Hern","Tayo, we've looked at that from time to time, the unsecured that we have on our balance sheet is primarily just our line of credit, but we keep an eye on that market. However, we given the size and quality of our assets, they tend to be very, very big financings institutional quality and getting some extremely attractive rates.","So we see some good financing on the unsecured side. But it would limit what we could do on the secured side, if we were to go that route. So we're very happy with the direction we've gone and type of financings we're able to put in place. But we do realize the unsecured market looks good as well.","Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","And then, Art, just a quick question in regards to Arizona and that whole market, how you're thinking about it at this point. I know it's still a lot of interesting things you could be doing there. You haven't put a timeline. But I'm just curious whether it's getting closer or whether still watching and then we'll take a while before you do anything new in that market?","Arthur Coppola","The market continues to get better. You're right about that. By many measures, it's a lot better than what people realize. And homebuilders are building again, and they're even complaining that they've got labor shortages, believe it or not, and there is tech coming into the marketplace.","All of the fundamentals are really good in Phoenix. And if you look at the cycles in Phoenix, it's up and down, about every 10 years something happens, and usually it's like a year or so and it bounces back. This was highly unusual, but this was like a three-year bottom. But it's clearly on its way back. When we feel that we have sufficient tailwind that justifies ground-up development in Phoenix, then we'll be talking about it. We're not talking about it today.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Just two quick questions. Just going back to the JV theme, so I'm crystal clear on that. In all the JVs you have at this point, are there any ventures in which your economic position is different than the position that is represented in the 8-K at the moment?","Arthur Coppola","I think the only ones would be on the plus side that there are some promotes that we have, where we have a bigger piece of the upside in a couple of joint ventures that are out there. But as Tom indicated earlier, if you're applying whatever cap rate you're applying to our portfolio income, the NAV accretion or dilution on the sale of North Park is relatively de-minimis. But there is nothing else of that nature in the portfolio.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Just staying on North Park. The interest cost was roughly $11.5 million a year. I think on the loan that was in place and prior, and so there is a $10 million FFO hit. It means that you've been reporting so far $21.5 million or something of that nature as part of your unconsolidated NOI on that property, is that correct?","Thomas O'Hern","The NOI was closer to $20 million, but in fact you're trying to come up with an NAV a piece if you may not be aware of is, there was a kicker on that loan. When that loan can due, there was a kicker due to lender, and so you'd have to factor that into your valuation as well.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","What were the circumstances around that kicker?","Arthur Coppola","That's got nothing to do with us, Tom. Honestly, it did not affect our position, it affects the properties position, and the family that owns it now is positioned. It doesn't affect us, never was going to affect us. We had a preferred equity position, and at the end the total FFO that was coming in from that preferred equity position, Tom said earlier was around $10 million.","And the dilution from getting rid of that $300 million investment was around $0.05 a share. And the dilution from the other dispositions was around $0.05 a share. And when you take into consideration, where we put that money, the accretion is net $0.10 a share positive. And we've gone from non-core to core and we're very excited to be where we're at.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Ben Yang with Evercore Partners.","Ben Yang - Evercore Partners","Just a quick one for me. I think, Art, you mentioned buying partners out can be quite noisy, highly structured transactions, but at the same time I think you said your partners at FlatIron tested the market for that piece. I was curious how far that 6% is from a market and maybe more on like transaction? Is there a good rule of thumb to adjust cap rates, when we see stuff like this happening?","Arthur Coppola","Could you repeat that please, Ben? You were kind of coming in and out on that.","Ben Yang","I'm just wondering the 6% on FlatIron highly structured, but at the same time the partners tested the market out as well. What's a good rule of thumb to adjust? I mean what would the market cap rate look like on FlatIron, is it 6%, is it 5.75%. Just curious, if you have any thoughts on that, given the fact, that they did test the market?","Arthur Coppola","The property is on its own, on a standout basis would probably trade at least a 100 basis points lower than the position that we were able to come back in at. But that was a function of the structure of the deal that had structural advantages in the deal that aren't necessarily transparent to everybody just reading that we owned a 25% interest in the center that we had another 20% promote that we were already into the promote. There is no rule of thumb.","Ben Yang - Evercore Partners","So that's when you think it's about a 100 basis points in size?","Arthur Coppola","The bottomline is, if you're buying a partner out, the partner wants to believe that they got full value and you don't want to pay more than full value. And you do it for reasons that are the reasons, that you do it for at the time. So we felt it was a very good use of our capital. We were happy to do it. And there really are no rules of thumb. It was a very attractive transaction from our viewpoint and it was an attractive transaction from our partner's viewpoint, both at the inception and at its conclusion. And that's a basis of good partnerships.","Ben Yang - Evercore Partners","Is there still kind of a mid $400 a foot mall or has sales trended up since you sold that interest to your partner?","Arthur Coppola","No, sales are north of $500 a foot. And we've got some very attractive simple plans there that we think are going to help us take it up to its next level. And it's a great center, couple that with our 29th Street, just 8 or 10 miles up the street, it's a very nice concentration that we've got there.","Arthur Coppola","We look forward to seeing all of you in a couple of weeks in San Diego. And thank you for joining our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"13954":["Macerich Co.

Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded, and would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter 2016 earnings call.

Consistent with past practice, we will be limiting this call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call or John Perry or Jean Wood as well.","Second quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by strength in most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. In addition, we completed our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also completed some significant financing transactions. We'll talk about all those in greater detail later in the call.","For the quarter, FFO was $1.02 compared to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Same center NOI increased by 6.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. This was positively impacted by about $6 million of lease termination revenue in the second quarter of 2016. This timing is somewhat accelerated compared to our guidance, which had most of the 2016 estimated lease termination revenues forecast in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Our estimate for same center NOI growth for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range.","The gross operating margin at the center improved at 70.3% in the quarter, up from 69.8% in the second quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was relatively modest, $1.7 million for the quarter, down from $2 million a year ago. As I mentioned, lease termination revenues at about $6 million for the quarter, that compared to $2.8 million last year. Year-to-date lease term fees are $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million for the first six months of last year.","And our full-year assumption for lease term revenue this year changed at $15 million. And when we make the decision and negotiate a lease termination agreement, it's typically a trade-off for making the business decision to take the cash now and incur the higher vacancy loss at future minimum rent and charges until the space is released.","During second quarter, the average interest rate was 3.52%, up slightly from a year ago, which was 3.47%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics included debt to market cap that's about 36%; and interest coverage ratio, a very strong 3.6 times; a forward debt to EBITDA of 7.2 times; and average debt maturity of 6.4 years.","The financing market for high quality regional malls remains very good. We have closed or committed on two life company deals and we're currently in the market with a large CMBS deal. On May 27, we closed a $375 million financing on North Bridge Mall that fared \u2013 there was a 12-year fixed rate loan at 3.68%, and we used a portion of those proceeds to pay off the old loan, which was $188 million with an interest rate of 7.20%.","And that was a life company transaction, another life company deal, which we'll be closing here in the next week or so. It is at The Village at Corte Madera. We're putting a $225 million fixed rate loan in place, and that's a 12-year deal, fixed at 3.50%. Again some nice financing at historically low levels in terms of the interest rates.","On July 5, we closed on an extension of our $1.5 billion line of credit \u2013 our line of credit was set to mature in April of 2018 and including our extension options on the new facility goes out to July of 2021 and reduces our borrowing rate to about LIBOR plus 1.33%, about a 17 basis point improvement from our old facility. At quarter end, the balance on that facility was about $1 billion; however, we got some significant financings that will take place in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","We should generate 350 million of excess proceeds from Fresno, which is currently unencumbered. We're in the market with that right now. It's going to be a CMBS transaction. Term was expected to be ten years. We're getting bids now. We're getting some very, very strong quotes. We'd expect that to close in September. In addition, we'll have about $75 million of excess proceeds from the closing of Corte Madera. And in addition, later this year Eastland, is an unencumbered asset that we will probably finance and that could be as much as $175 million. So, with that, it would comfortably put our line of credit outstanding balance at $500 million or less.","We concluded our third $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program on July 11. This was part of the board authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was announced in October. With these three separate investment banks to execute these ASR programs, the summary results where we invested the entire $1.2 billion, the average share price on all three combined was $78.62 and the total number of shares repurchased was 15.3 million shares, roughly 9.6% of our shares outstanding.","Just on the guidance, again, we reaffirm guidance today of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year. And just to reiterate, the remaining three quarters, we estimate of that FFO for the full year 25% or so will be in the third quarter and 29% of that total in the fourth quarter.","And with that, I'll now turn over to Bob to discuss leasing and tenant environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Recent activity during the second quarter remained strong, reflecting demand from the retailers for the Macerich portfolio. First, let me talk about leasing spreads. Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during the previous quarter. Regionally, East Coast and West Coast properties have produced the highest leasing spreads. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.31 per square foot. During the second quarter, a total of 848,000 square feet of leases were signed, up from 733,000 square feet in the previous quarter. The average term signed in the second quarter increased to 6.0 years.","Occupancy. Leasing levels at the end of the second quarter were 95.0%. This represents a 50 basis point year-over-year decline and a 10 basis point decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we discussed in the last earnings call, the decline in year-over-year occupancy was primarily caused by the movement of Fashion Outlets in Niagara and South Park out of the development portfolio into the stabilized pool. The occupancy also reflects the disposition of Capitola Mall and the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Temporary occupancy improved at the end of the second quarter, dropping 30 basis points from the previous quarter to 5.2%.","Sales. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot compared to $623 per square foot on a year-over-year basis. Same center sales per square foot were $644 compared to $629 for the year earlier period. This is a 2.4% increase. Sales were strongest in the West Coast centers, and the categories that showed the strongest sales during the second quarter were beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear, and leisure and jewelry.","I want to take a minute, and talk about tenant demand. Within our portfolio, tenant interest remains strongest in the higher productivity centers, the higher growth markets, and the coastal locations. This demand allows us to replace underproductive or struggling stores with those retailers looking to expand. Demand is strongest among, one, core brands renewing and expanding existing locations; two, brand extensions from successful retailers; three, foreign-based retailers; and four, online retailers migrating to in-line stores.","Within the last category of online retailers, we see many companies building the infrastructure to open brick-and-mortar locations in a traditional store rollout program. Some examples of this includes Blue Nile, Amazon, Peloton, Warby Parker, and Bonobos. We are also focusing on bringing online retailers into the centers by reducing the physical and economic barriers to entry. Examples of this strategy includes stores such as Combatant Gentlemen, Blink, Beta and WithMe. It is clear, the universe of online retailers will expand in our shopping centers. Some will take a traditional approach to store rollouts, and others will be nurtured through non-traditional canvassing and deal structures. This represents a growing opportunity within our portfolio.","Development. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce the redevelopment of an existing Sears store located at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. This center is one of three important assets owned by Macerich in the New York boroughs, and serves a trade area of approximately 4 million residents. This Macerich's acquisition in 2012, we have worked to improve King's Plaza's merchandise mix, anchor lineup, sales productivity, physical appearance, marketing and property operations.","Our goal has been to elevate King's Plaza to the level that we have achieved at Queens Center. The redevelopment of the Sears building represents a major step in that direction. Sears will be replaced with six to eight large format retailers and restaurants, all oriented around the dramatic four-story atrium.","The redevelopment will be anchored by new Primark and Zara flagship stores. We expect these retailers to generate a three-fold increase in sales and foot traffic compared to the existing Sears box. Equally as important, they will open the door to new specialty stores who have not historically been ready to locate at the center.","From the perspective of Macerich's portfolio, we are able to significantly reduce our rental exposure to Sears, while increasing our footprint with both Zara and Primark as well as improving our position in the New York marketplace. Sears will no longer be a top 10 rent payer within our portfolio.","The Macerich portfolio is well suited for Primark's entry into the East Coast markets. In June, Primark had a successful opening at Danbury Fair, which was followed in July with their opening at Freehold Raceway. Both of these locations repurposed as Sears anchor and initial reports indicated significant increase in foot traffic and sales at these centers. Kings Plaza will represent Primark's third location with Macerich. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number in the coming months.","And, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks, Bob, and thanks, Tom. As you can see, we had another very strong quarter from an operating viewpoint. More importantly, from my viewpoint, we also are very pleased to have completed our portfolio management and capital allocation strategy through the completion of our share buyback program. You'll remember that we announced that program literally about nine months ago and unlike certain other folks, we completed the program in very short order. We did exactly what we said we're going to do. We're very happy to have it behind us. We think that it was a great transaction that gave us the capital to invest into the balance of our portfolio that what we feel is a substantial discount to our NAV and we're pleased to have it behind us so that the focus going forward can be on the operating fundamentals of the company as well as our very strong redevelopment and development pipeline.","I want to touch upon a topic that has been \u2013 a justifiable topic in terms of questions that a lot of investors and the analytical community has asked themselves and that has to do with rent spreads and whether or not in an environment where you have decelerating sales or sales that are not growing like that used to grow, can you continue to have rent growth in the manner that we've enjoyed and our peers have enjoyed over a long period of time.","Like I said, it's a legitimate question and especially when you look at other property types where it's not usual to have positive rent spreads continue year-in and year-out, but it really comes back down to just the laws of supply and demand. We are in the real estate business and supply and demand is the key to everything.","Looking backwards, past performance cannot be a guarantee of future results, as I say. But over the past 10 years, we've averaged 17.4% positive rent spreads over the past 40 quarters. We've had high watermarks of 28%, low watermarks in 2009 of 7% give or take. But on average, we've averaged 17%. I will tell you that if our rent spreads come in at 13% or they come in at 21%, I don't get excited about that one way or the other, because I know that fundamentally when I think about our mark-to-market that the ability to generate mid-teen type of rent spreads is embedded within our portfolio.","As you look at our property type and you look at regional Class A malls and you think about the universe of the supply of that product, the supply of that product is, let's say, that it's 400 or 500 regional malls. And when we think about that product type in terms of supply, we can look to by analogy High Street retail, which is also a very low supply, high demand sector. And there have been studies that have been done \u2013 more studies that have been done in the regional mall Class A sector as it relates to High Street that it is a property type that has shown significant well above average rent growth over very long periods of time.","And that's what we've enjoyed in our portfolio, that's what our peers with Class A malls have enjoyed in their portfolios. History has been our \u2013 had supported that view and the fundamentals that we're sitting on support our optimism for this to go forward.","When we think about the demand side of the transaction, in terms of tenant demand for space, a lot of folks tend to focus on the one or two names that have gone bankrupt recently or the one or two names that people are worried about going bankrupt. But they tend not to focus on the 30 or 40 or 50 names of retailers that have got brand extension or are just growing their portfolio or now with the recent events with Brexit, we have tenants that have got global expansion plans that are upping their expansion conversations about their expansion in the U.S., which is creating incremental demand.","You think about other factors that may or may not influence our demand, and people worry at times about department stores. And we've had more than one of our department stores and so the problem with their sales is mall traffic. Mr. Les Wexner had a great quote on this point and I'll probably butcher it, but basically he said the trouble with department stores is not mall traffic, the trouble with mall traffic is the department stores. What he is basically saying is the department stores are not pulling their weight. You take a look at the parking lots of more than one of our department stores and some of our malls, and they're not as busy as the other parking lots. This creates opportunity. We and our other Class A mall peers have had great history of replacing our department stores that have become unproductive over time with better uses.","And we see this as a great opportunity going forward. Anecdotally, we think that the Kings Plaza remerchandising opportunity is going to be dramatic in terms of what that's going to do for mall traffic. People worry when they think about rent spreads, about whether or not e-commerce is going to drain sales away from the malls, and to reduce the demand for space in the mall. In fact, the advent of digital commerce creates new sources of demand for us and that it creates new tenants that are born digitally and then want to migrate to brick-and-mortar locations, and we are seeing this throughout our portfolio.","And finally, the thing that probably creates the most anxiety about mall spreads, rent spreads, is when people see sales flat for a certain period of time. And then that causes them anxiety. And that's legitimate for that anxiety. But what I would point to you is this \u2013 that if you have a fundamentally very strong portfolio and you have no new supply being created and you have demand increasing, then you're going to be able to lease that portfolio and you're going to be able to lease it at strong rent.","We took a look a couple of years ago and we dissected sales within our centers. We said if we take the top two-thirds in each tenant category, what are those tenants doing in terms of sales productivity and what are bottom one-third of the tenants in our portfolio doing in terms of sales productivity. Because that's generally the way we think about things. We tend to think about constantly the bottom 20% to 30% of the producers at our malls as being merchandisers that we're going to want to recapture over a period of time and replace with names that are more reflective of the merchants that people want to do business with today.","Here is some numbers. In our top 30 centers, our average sales per square foot are $726 a square foot. That doesn't really tell the story. Within each tenant category, whether it'd be apparel, shoes, jewelry, general, the top two-thirds within each category in these centers did $1,028 a square foot and they comprised about 60% of the GLA in those centers. The bottom one-third of the retailers in each of the respective categories in those centers averaged about $313 a square foot. So it's really a tale of two cities here. You got the great producers and then you got the folks that are lagging. You got two-thirds of your tenants within our top 30 properties are averaging over $1,000 a foot, one-third of our tenants by category are averaging $300 a square foot. So our job is simply to weed out the people that are unproductive and to replace them with the tenants that are more reflective of the top two-thirds.","And when we look at the cost of occupancies within our portfolio, you can't just look at the homogenized number. Our average cost of occupancy in these 30 centers is 13.5%. So you can debate all day about oh, can you push that number. But the reality is that our top two-thirds of the tenants in those top 30 centers, they do over $1,000 a foot and their occupancy cost is under 11%. So when those tenants, when their leases expire, we're sitting on substantial rent growth from the time that they've signed their lease and they can easily afford to pay rent that would generate in from 15% or so rent spreads for us.","And then, when we think about pruning out the bottom part of our portfolio, we're seeking tenants that are going to produce sales that are going to be closer to the top performers. And even if you only got 10% or 11% of sales from tenants that are doing on average $1,000 a foot our top producers in our portfolio, you are going to generate substantial increases. That's why we have the confidence that these rent spreads are sustainable, we have history as our guide and, obviously, it doesn't guarantee future performance, but it is something that we are absolutely comfortable that rent spreads will continue to be a big driver of our same-center NOI growth going forward.","And, with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Christy McElroy from Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good morning to you guys.","Arthur Coppola","Hi, Christy.","Christy McElroy","Hey. So there was a press report recently about an approval you won for an outlet project in Carson, California near the 405, can you provide some color on that and overall sort of your intentions to build outlets in LA?","Arthur Coppola","Well, we think it's a great site. We think it's a great location. It's true that we've entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement with the City of Carson to build a 500,000 give-or-take square foot outlet mall there and we are in the process of finishing up our development agreement on that. Once the development agreement is finished, which we hope to have done in the near future, then we'll go ahead and make a formal announcement about it. But you obviously picked up on either what's in the press or what's happening in local city council rooms and it is true that we do have a plan to build an outlet mall at Carson. There is still some work to be done on the development agreement, but we're very bullish on it and we think it's a great opportunity for us.","Christy McElroy","Thanks. And then just sticking to LA. Wondering if you could provide an update on your plans for redevelopment of Westside Pavilion in the context of the progress that's been made at Century City and the scope of the project at Beverly Center just considering the competitive environment in that market?","Arthur Coppola","Sure. We see it as a great opportunity. It's tremendous piece of real estate and it's part of our core holdings. We have no intention of chasing the same customer that literally The Grove and Century City and Santa Monica Place and Beverly Center and [indiscernible] everybody is chasing the same customer, the high end affluent customer in the West LA market. And we think that there is a different mousetrap that can be created at Westside. We are not in a position to say exactly what that's going to look like, but we've got at least four or five different development alternatives that we're thinking about, each one of which are very interesting.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll next go to Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi. Good morning.","Arthur Coppola","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, how are you, Art? Just two questions. One is, as you guys look at the department stores, you spoke about, one, sort of department store parking lot not being busy and then separately, you spoke about a third of your inline tenants at your top centers that are far less productive than the top performing. So, in your view, to drive \u2013 as you look at redevelopment and continue to drive mall productivity, which is more important to you, getting back department store boxes or getting out those or replacing the tenants who're averaging $313 a foot?","Arthur Coppola","They're both equally important. Sometimes you don't necessarily have the ability to recycle an anchor as quickly as you'd like to, so there are things that \u2013 generally, small space is going to be more accessible to you than department store space. But look, it's what we do every day, it's what we do for a living, and we got one department that does nothing, but the smaller shop space is facing it another group that does nothing, but the anchor stuff and it's what we do. And they're equally important, they're both really important.","And kind of what's left, which I think is left a little bit unsaid is that as the department stores potentially reduce their numbers in terms of conventional department stores in the United States, then that's not necessarily a bad thing. But it really gives us an opportunity to bring in other traffic generators, whatever those might be, but it also really creates more demand for inline space because as the number of department store locations reduce then that reduces the distribution points that manufacturers and creative folks have to distribute their merchandise. And so they become interested in inline stores as a consequence.","Take a look at an outlet mall, outlet malls that we have at FOC and FON, we've got over 400,000 feet of small shop space in these malls, and they're fully occupied, and that's because the manufacturers are not competing with the department stores as distribution points for them. So, as this goes, if this hand plays out over time, U.S. malls will begin to look more like the malls around the world. You go to Canada, for example, you've got 1.5 department stores, maybe two in most of those big malls in Canada, and the small shop space could be easily 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 square feet. And I think the reason small shop space there is fully occupied and fairly productive is that it's the best distribution point for the manufacturers of the merchandise.","So, look, it's an evolutionary process, but we see that if you have must-have little space, you're always going to have a good idea for it so long as you, obviously, are in touch with the pulse of the market, which we are.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, sort of following-up that, Art. Now that you have the Sears box back at Kings Plaza, you have the redevelopment there, bring in six to eight new retailers there, but what about sort of a bigger picture? I mean, the center, it abuts the water so it's got potential on the back side, and it just seems like there is a lot more potential than just redoing the Sears box. So, longer term, what do you think we can expect to see out of this center over the next few years as you further the redevelopment plans presumably?","Arthur Coppola","Well, look, we got a lot of work to be done here. We're on the right path. We like to take things kind of step \u2013 sequentially, Alexander, as you know, so we're going to stay with the step-by-step approach. It's not a small task, the task that we have to redemise the 300,000 square foot four-level apartment store, but the opportunity is huge. And we think that the rewards are going to be big. So we're thinking about the densification opportunities, but it's not anywhere close to being in the immediate horizon. The stronger we make the center, the stronger all of those other densification thoughts become.","Alexander Goldfarb","Great. Thanks a lot.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","Hello, guys. Good morning.","Arthur Coppola","Good morning, Rich.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Hi, Rich.","Rich Moore","Thank you. I'm curious on the Seritage venture that you guys have. You now have this Sears box, which I don't think is part of Seritage underway. Is there anything going on with the rest of or with the Seritage joint venture with regard to Sears budget?","Arthur Coppola","Nothing that we're in a position to announced right now. This was not part of the Seritage conversation. It was just a landlord-tenant relationship with Sears. We're working with our partners \u2013 Seritage to think about the redevelopment of the nine centers that we have Sear stores together in and we think there are good opportunities at each of them, but nothing that we're \u2013 we're going to be patient. I've said that before. We maybe a little bit of an outlier compared to our peers in terms of our willingness to be patient, but we're going to be patient.","Rich Moore","Okay. And I think, Art, it takes like six months or something \u2013 I think you got to give like a six-month notice to Sears before you do anything, and I'm curious are we in that window yet or do we still have at least six months to go probably before we can do anything at the boxes?","Arthur Coppola","So, those are logistics, Rich, and we've got lots of alternatives available to us. We have a flat-out option to recapture space at each of those nine locations, but we have found it relatively expensive to think about recapturing half of the space and then keeping Sears and business in the other half. So we're really thinking about our alternatives. I would note that we did just have Primark opened in half of the space of the Sears store at Danbury and Freehold. So, two of the nine are arguably done at this point in time.","Rich Moore","Okay. And then last thing is, Tom, the shares you bought back in 3Q, because I know, as you went a little bit over into July for your buyback, what would the amount be in just 3Q, do you have any idea?","A - Thomas O'Hern","The settle-up amount, the way it's structured, Rich, is you get 80% of the shares when you start the program, so that was in the case of [indiscernible] roughly 4 million shares. And then in July when the program concluded, we got the remaining 1 million shares. So 4 million of the 5 million shares were during the quarter, and remaining 1 million shares was on July 11 or so.","Rich Moore","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And we'll now go to Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey, guys. Good morning, I guess. Just couple of questions. One of the things that you mentioned at the very beginning was the competitive bids that you're seeing from the CMBS market. It caught my attention because I think in past commentary you've mentioned how weak CMBS market may have been. Do you think that's a more reflection of the strength of the quality of property that you're bringing to market? I think it's doing maybe $635 a square foot, $640 a square foot, or are you seeing broad interest \u2013 or do you think it's broad interest in that sort of a financing alterative?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Well, I think the market has gotten stronger. It is subject to being more volatile than the bank market, the life company market, but in this particular case, Fresno is a very strong asset, as you said, doing over $600 in sales, and we got bids from probably eight different investment banks and they're all pretty competitive in the range of $200 million over the underlying treasury. So it was good to see, it was encouraging to see, and I think that at the moment is a viable form of financing for probably A \u2013 A minus to B plus assets, some A assets may be competitive, it's a big deal, it's roughly $350 million deal. So we're encouraged, but we're not looking for a lot of CMBS loans right at the moment. So I'm not sure we're in a perfect position to say exactly how deep it is. But for a quality asset, certainly they're right at the moment, Rich.","Richard Hill","Great. Great. Thank you. And just one other question. Obviously, an impressive quarter for you guys. I'm curious, how should we think about that in the context of your earnings guidance being reaffirmed or your FFO guidance, should I say?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Right. Well, as I commented in my remarks, the big part of the quarters we had, we had a significant amount of lease term revenue that happened in the third quarter and moreover our forecast was for that to be in the third and fourth quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, the second quarter, we have roughly $6 million historically and what we forecast for the year, we forecast $15 million, but the bulk of that we had forecast in the third and fourth quarter. So, that got accelerated a little bit and as a result of that moving earlier in the year, it's going to be in that \u2013 we're not going to see the same kind of growth in the third and fourth quarter.","And I think \u2013 Bob, he may want to comment on this as well. I think also to the extent we have bankruptcies, we're going to feel that more in the third and fourth quarter. Some of those tenants remained in occupancy through the second quarter. And also when you make the business decision, and it is a business decision, and take a lease termination payment, that means you're taking that, but in exchange for that you're going to lose minimum revenue in the second half of the year. That's a little bit of what we're going to face in the third and fourth quarter.","Robert Perlmutter","Yeah.","Richard Hill","Thank you.","Robert Perlmutter","From a bankruptcy standpoint, most of the store closures would occur in the back half of the year.","Richard Hill","Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And we'll now go to Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Similar questions on the lease term. Was the acceleration of the lease term income at your choice? Is it something that you wanted to deal with now rather than postpone it or was there something else that caused the acceleration?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Well, I think part of it had to do with Sears and I think on our forecast we had that happening in the third quarter, not the second, so that was a little bit of an acceleration on our part. But, generally speaking, it's a decision on our part. When we give our guidance at the beginning of the year, it's an estimate based on some facts that we may be aware of, but also a lot of it is history. And, for example, in 2014, for the full year, we had $9 million of lease term fees; in 2015, it was $11.5 million or so of lease term fees. And we felt there'd be more in 2016, and part of that was as a result of specific conversations we'd had with tenants, such as Sears, and the other part was just the environment we were in.","Robert Perlmutter","Yeah. Craig, this is Bob Perlmutter. The only thing I would add is, on Sears and with another large one, candidly it was accelerated because there was deals completed with replacement tenants.","Craig Schmidt","Great. And then the management company business seemed more productive with somewhat higher revenue, but lower expenses. Was there anything that caused that?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Well, we've got \u2013 I think we had some lumpy expenses that hit last year, but we've got more JVs this year, Craig. Because the JVs we did with the Government of Singapore and Heitman were done in the fourth quarter of last year as well as January of this year, plus we have Country Club Plaza, which is a JV. So, as a result of having more joint ventures, we're going to have more management company revenue.","Craig Schmidt","Great. Thank you.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now go to Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Yeah. Hi. I guess, in terms of the e-commerce discussions, do you have a sense at this point as to how many stores could be opened in the portfolio, say, by the end of 2017?","Arthur Coppola","How many digitally native...","Michael Mueller","Yeah.","Arthur Coppola","...retailers that are not currently in malls could be open with us by the end of next year.","Michael Mueller","Yeah, exactly.","Arthur Coppola","It's evolving, it's picking up steam. We're finding that we're having good success in identifying retailers at an early stage in terms of their growth strategies. It's hard to put a number on it. And even if I had a number, which I don't, I'd hate to put it out there, because I see it as a growing number that's going to grow quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year for quite the foreseeable future. So I wouldn't want to put a ceiling on it by even putting a number on it.","Michael Mueller","Okay.","Arthur Coppola","It's early day, but it is definitely a big source of demand going forward.","Michael Mueller","Got it. And so, it feels like traction is there and stores are going to opening throughout this year?","Arthur Coppola","Well, there's no question that there is traction there, and there is no question that stores are going to be opening with us and we understand, look, the reasoning, it's interesting. Some of their reasoning is not necessarily sales driven, Combatant General (sic) [Combatant Gentlemen] (40:35), which opened their first retail location with us at Santa Monica Place a couple of weeks ago, they have 300,000 online customers, they've only been in business digitally for about three years, and they are not measuring success at Santa Monica place by sales. They are seeing that store as being more of a customer acquisition vehicle and a brand awareness vehicle. Now, they are certainly happy to produce sales out of that location, but they \u2013 and each of them have different views on it, but more than a few of the digitally native retailers view brick-and-mortar as being as much about brand awareness as sales productivity.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. And then, separately, appreciate the comments on occupancy cost. So it looks like you're in the mid 13%s today. So, for this portfolio, do you have a sense as to where it was pre-downturn, because it's obviously very different than it was six, eight years ago?","Arthur Coppola","Yeah. Pre-downturn, Mike, we were in the 12.5% to 13.5% range. And then, obviously, as a result of the downturn and decreasing sales, that metric went up significantly. But the big difference today, Mike, we have a much higher quality portfolio. I mean if you look at where we were sales per foot on the portfolio in 2007, I think we're probably $150 a foot lower quality productivity and sales...","Arthur Coppola","We're at $467...","A - Thomas O'Hern","$467 versus almost in the mid $600s now. So, we've got a significantly better portfolio, and the higher the quality of your portfolio, the higher the occupancy cost as a percentage of sales that you're going to be able to generate and sustain.","Michael Mueller","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Hey, Todd.","Todd Thomas","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just first back to the guidance and comp center [indiscernible] forecast of 4.5% to 5% for the year. So you're at 7% year-to-date. I understand the lease term fee income was a little more frontend loaded this year versus last year, but it would imply 2% to 3%, I guess in the back half of the year. Is that the right read, just trying to make sure expectations are?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Yeah. I mean our bias would probably be at the top end of that today based on what we know today, but yeah, roughly 3% on average in the last two quarters. And again we're going against some very tough comps in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, when I think we were north of 7% on average.","Todd Thomas","Okay. Got it. And then, Bob, any sports authority exposure impacting the portfolio in the third quarter and fourth quarter?","Robert Perlmutter","It's pretty small. I think we had four or five locations, most of which were non-mall locations, and I believe today one's been released by [indiscernible].","Todd Thomas","Okay. Any idea on the timing to re-tenant those and maybe where rents were in place for Sports Authority and what you expect to be able to achieve on re-tenanting the space?","Robert Perlmutter","Again, we know it's pretty immaterial in terms of our tenant base. My sense is the rents probably reflected the market. So, it's probably more an issue in terms of the loss of rental released as opposed to spreads.","Todd Thomas","Okay. I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies has our next question.","Omotayo Okusanya","Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Can you just talk a little bit about operating margins, again went up again this quarter, which was a pleasant surprise, just how sustainable is it at 70% plus? And what else can you do to keep driving operating margins up?","A - Thomas O'Hern","Tayo, yeah, we're over at 70% this quarter. Part of that was buoyed by the lease term fees. But I think on average for the year, we're at 69% \u2013 over 69.5%. So directionally we keep moving up. Last year, we did it pretty aggressively with expense cuts, which is kind of a one-time exercise. We've been able to maintain those, but now, most of what we see is coming from revenue growth and may have noticed other income was a little bit higher this quarter and part of that was driven by Country Club Plaza being in for the quarter, but \u2013 and part of that was from the hotel being opened at Tysons, but we also had additional parking revenues and revenues that we're generating from our common areas.","So, that's been a big emphasis this year on generating more revenue from our common area, could be advertising, could be sponsorship income. It's basically non-real estate revenue, and that has been an emphasis and that's going to help us to continue to move that gross margin up.","Omotayo Okusanya","Great. And then the second one for me just around the tenant watch list if there's any. Can you update on maybe new names that may be on the list or tenants that people might not be fully aware of that, maybe having some issues?","Robert Perlmutter","Tayo, this is Bob Perlmutter. I don't think the watch list has really changed in the first six months of the year. The activity during the beginning of the year pretty much reflected what we had anticipated. There are a number of groups that stay on the watch list, the characteristics of these groups are more larger store fleets, weaker brands, bad capital structures, some are public companies, some are not. So, we continue to maintain them. And as the landlords, we do the same thing, we try to mitigate our exposure to them while we can, and prepare as best we can. But we don't see a big change in the marketplace on the back half of the year.","Arthur Coppola","And as I mentioned, Tayo, on my comments from my view point, the opportunity list is a lot more robust than the watch list.","Omotayo Okusanya","Got you. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now go to Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","A - Thomas O'Hern","Hi, Vin.","Vincent Chao","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to \u2013 just get a sense of what is embedded in the outlook for the back half for Aero and PacSun?","Robert Perlmutter","Aero and PacSun are working through restructurings. PacSun appears to be making more progress. We have packages that have been worked out with both \u2013 in general, there is a few store closures, some rent release and some assumptions. So, the impact on the back half of the year is factored into the projection. It's not a material number either way.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks for that. And just curious on the WithMe partnership at Santa Monica and Century 21. Just curious if you could comment on how that went, what the lineup looks like for the rest of the year there and maybe, if there has been any discussions with Century 21 subsequent to their six-week venture there?","Arthur Coppola","First, they were pleased with what they accomplished out of their exposure and I think in that case it also \u2013 I think they measured success as much about extension of their brand awareness as we did the actual sales that they consummated. We'll be announcing another new retailer that will be taking that space in the near term. And that partnership is going well. It's focused on a number of locations. Going forward, the majority of those locations will be common area locations as if you think that's probably the most efficient way and then the most interesting way to go ahead and deploy with their technology.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi. Good morning. This is Caitlin Burrows. I just had another question on the Kings Plaza redevelopment. And it looks like the expected yield went from 7% to 8% down to 4%, in part is due to increased extracted cost. So, I was wondering, what is driving that extra cost?","Arthur Coppola","It's really I think just the fact of demising it into multiple locations, a few more than we had otherwise anticipated. It was a placeholder before and that's why we put it into the shadow pipeline. But it's evolving. These are the numbers that we see today. I think it is important to note that we believe we're being very conservative in the way that we are reporting this return to you.","I'm aware of other owners of malls that when they bring in a replacement department store, sometimes they include what they think is going to be the uplift in market wrench for the entire mall into the return they expect to get from that department store. And I'm not saying that in a critical way. I'm saying that because I'm just aware there are different ways of thinking about what your return is when you replace the department store.","We're not doing that in this situation, and we're looking at it, comparing it to the very substantial rent that Sears would have been paying over the next couple of years. Now, Sears, the lease expires anyway in a couple of years, so you could argue the 8% return is [indiscernible] the more realistic return. But we wanted to \u2013 look, we know that a lot of you are trying to models based upon this information, and that that's as important as the return that we're reporting. And so, we wanted to help you with the model and know that it's really 4% over what we're getting right now.","As we think about it we \u2013 look, we do think about it long-term, and we think about any investment in a replacement of the department store or any investment of that size in terms of IRRs, so we didn't expect it holding period also and the actual IRR on that particular investment, and this is just again going over the current rent that Sears is paying approaches 10%. So the company and the board felt very comfortable going forward. Go ahead, Bob.","Robert Perlmutter","Caitlin, the only thing I would add is, as we got into the redevelopment of the box, we clearly felt it was more than just taking the box and dividing up for tenants. We felt there was an opportunity to really create a front door to the shopping center, which it's really lacking now, an opportunity to really open up the facade, an opportunity to get vertical transportation from the parking deck into the fourth floor tenant. So, we definitely felt that it was a major redevelopment for the property, and there is a lot of items in there that are more than just taking the box and carving it up and maximizing the revenues.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Yeah. And then, on just that idea of when you guys are talking about being conservative, and thinking about it like this is the new rent you'll get kind of above and beyond what Sears was paying before, when you think about the other redevelopment projects you have, is that similar to how you calculate the returns then, again, thinking about who is there now and what the incremental add will be as oppose to the total?","Arthur Coppola","Yes. Looking at it, stepping away from it, for example, when we thought about the return that we will be seeing at Walnut Creek, we looked at what was our opportunity cost, what would the income be, which [indiscernible] averaging about $15 million at the time. And so we measured the return on investment over the income that was in place before we started tearing down buildings. And so after we got done tearing down buildings, we took that income down to around $8 million or $9 million. We didn't measure our incremental return from the reduced level. We measured that from what it used to be in the kind of do nothing scenario.","Operator","And we'll move on to Paul Morgan with Canaccord.","Arthur Coppola","Hey, Paul.","Paul Morgan","Hi. Good morning. Appreciate the discussion about rent spreads and top two-thirds and bottom one-third and I just want to kind of follow up on that. I mean how much of kind of that discrepancy in sales productivity is something that you think you could kind of dismonetize, we can just sort of take kind of a mark-to-market approach versus \u2013 it may feel like there'll be some other factors like what specific malls, maybe the locations in the mall [indiscernible] would seem like there is going to be certain locations that are just always going to be less productivity if it's near in cap with a weaker anchor or things like that. I mean, how easy is it to just map that difference $313 to $1,000 a foot to kind of what your upside is going to be?","Arthur Coppola","Well, since this is what I've been doing for a living for over 40 years and since it's been this way every day, those 40 years, and since there really hasn't been any change, I feel very comfortable with our ability to continue to recycle tenants. This is what you do. It's the nature of the business. But if you remember, I think one of my peers indicated to you in call a few quarters ago, I think he was observing that because top 10 tenants when he went public 20 some years ago that only two or three of them are still in business. Well, does that mean that the business went bad or does that mean that we had eight great new top 10 tenants?","And frankly, the answer is, we got eight really good new guys and the eight guys that went away, they went away because they had matured. And I feel \u2013 look, it all comes back to supply and demand. And we can dissect this to the Nth degree, but the way that we look at things is that we think about not what is, but what can be. So we don't think about a space where tenants doing $300 a foot and say that's a $300 space. We look at it and say, potentially that's a $300 space because it's a crappy tenant.","We had a tenant at Santa Monica Place over the second level that I think was doing $300 a foot [indiscernible] $10,000 a foot tenant and a payroll tenant, and we didn't say, oh, that's a $300 foot location and we replace them with a really good new tenant, who is doing probably three times that, which \u2013 that's what we do every day, and by the way, it's not just us, it's our peers do that also.","Now, I will tell you that we're able to do that because we have properties that are must have properties. If we had commodity type of properties where we were located in some really secondary markets or territory markets or we're dealing with a portfolio of significantly lower quality properties, we wouldn't be in a position to have this conversation, but we're in high demand locations with great real estate somewhat similar to high street retail in the demand characteristic and returns and rent growth that those have enjoyed over the years. It's supply and demand, it all comes down to that.","Paul Morgan","So, I mean, it sounds like you would attribute a lot of that difference in sales, productivity, two things that are specific to the retail rather than like being on [indiscernible], typically?","Arthur Coppola","Absolutely. Right. Look there are certain locations that are always going to be less productive, but that's all baked into the numbers. And when we looked at and we said the top two-thirds of our tenants in each category do over $1,000 of foot and the bottom one-third by category do $313 a foot to average $726 a foot, that wasn't location specific. It was just [indiscernible] if I got nine tenants in this category, what are the top six doing and what are the bottom three doing and it doesn't matter where they're located. So it is a function frankly of, are you selling the merchandize that people want to buy.","Paul Morgan","Okay. And then just going back to the Kings redevelopment number. I definitely appreciate the kind of this clarity of that 4%, which we don't necessarily often see. But I mean how should I think of that number being kind of specific to Kings versus when we look at all the other Sears where you have or other anchors where you have anchor redevelopment opportunities? I mean, is the gap between your gross yield and your net yield that meaningful there or is it just because of the complexity in urban nature of Kings and the fact that Sears was paying pretty material rent, the difference [indiscernible]?","Arthur Coppola","Well, I think [indiscernible] that shouldn't \u2013 there is a fair amount of work that's being done within that box that is really common area in nature and is really mall specific and not tenant specific. So, we're creating a new Atrium interim to blacklist Boulevard, which really has nothing to do with redemising the space. But I will tell you that when it comes to anchor replacement, we don't expect that to be returns that are going to be the normal 8% to 10% types of returns.","And if we can achieve returns that we think are adequate and we think about that [indiscernible] cash-on-cash, we think about it in terms of a 10-year hold and we think about its impact on the mall and everything considered, we're going to be willing to if we believe that we can dramatically improve the quality of the draw. We're very happy to take a mid-single-digit type of return on a replacement, very happy to do it, and it's the right thing to do.","Paul Morgan","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back over to you, Art, for any additional or closing remarks.","Arthur Coppola","All right. Well, thank you all for joining us. Enjoy the rest of your summer and look forward to seeing and speaking with you again soon. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes our presentation for today. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day."],"13964":["Macerich Co.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Now I would like to turn things over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Good morning. Thank you, Kayla. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that maybe deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Senior Executive VP and Chief Operating Officer.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean.","The third quarter reflected continued solid operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $0.96, although was $0.02 less than consensus that was primarily due to a $2.5 million income tax expense that related to the sale of our interest in office building continuous to our Philadelphia project.","Same center NOI in the quarter was up 3.1%, so year-to-date same center NOI growth is at 2.9%. Lease term fees were $3.2 million for the quarter that was down compared to $7.8 million in the third quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was a modest 700,000 in the third quarter, year-to-date $4.9 million. So that has slowed significantly compared to the first half of 2017.","During the third quarter, the average interest rate is 3.66% of about 12 basis points from 3.54% a year ago. Continuing our practice of selling non-core assets during the quarter we sold our interest in office building at Philadelphia for $31 million and recorded a gain of $6.7 million and as I mentioned earlier a related tax expense of $2.5 million as that asset was owned in a taxable REIT subsidiary.","The balance sheet continues to be in good shape. Quarter end our debt to market cap was 48%, interest coverage ratio is a very healthy 3.4 times, the average debt maturity is 5.7 years also strong and that will improve with the financings were in process.","Floating rate debt is currently at 18% but that's also expected to drop after we do our financing program the balance of this year and the beginning of next year. Rates are still low and for strong malls the financing market is good. The following financings are plan to close in October through year-end or possibly the first part of next year.","Green Acres Commons was unencumbered asset. We put $130 million bank loan in place that close September 29. Freehold malls, we put a life company loan on that that closed on October 19, 200 million, 3.9% fixed for 12 years.","At Santa Monica Place we have an agreement for CMBS loan for $300 million that we expect to close in December and on Inland Center we also have CMBS loan arranged for $88 million that we expect to close in November.","So the net impact of those four financings are $391 million of excess proceeds to us and the excess proceeds will be used to pay down the line of credit. So there will be no increase in leverage as a result of the new financings.","We're also considering financings on the unencumbered assets Broadway Plaza and Tysons Tower and if those happen they need to delayed this year or early next year.","Our share buyback program in the third quarter we repurchased and retired 742,000 shares of common stock at an average price of 53. Year-to-date our buybacks have totaled 221 million and we retired 3.6 million shares roughly 2.5% of our common shares outstanding.","To restate a point that we have made before we are not levering up to do these buybacks, we're using the proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.","On October 24 we increased the quarterly dividend of our common shares to $0.74 per share per quarter a 4.2% increase.","And now I would like to turn over to Bob to discuss the retail environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks Tom.","Third quarter performance met our expectations as sales per square foot rose, leasing spreads were strong and occupancy remained stable despite the impact of bankruptcies in early terminations through the first three quarters.","Trailing 12 month leasing spreads were 15% which were down from the previous quarter still reflect a healthy leasing environment for quality centers. Average leases - our average rent per lease signed during the trailing 12 month period was $57.71 per square foot, this is 2.1% higher than the previous year. Average base rent within the portfolio was $56.88 per square foot this represents a 4.8% increase over the prior-year.","During the third quarter a total of 708,000 square feet of leases were signed. This brings the total activity during the first three quarters to over 2 million square feet. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter was 5.4 years. This compares against the Q2 average of 5.9 years.","Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 94.3%. This represented 100 basis point decrease on a year-over-year basis and a 10 basis point decrease in the second quarter. As already have discussed in past calls, the bankruptcy early termination of lower productivity tenants is an important opportunity to improve the merchandise mix and sales levels by leasing the higher productivity and more contemporary users.","The result is the balancing of short-term occupancy objectives with long-term goals of securing the best and most productive tenant mix which meets our consumers need and improve sale productivity ultimately leading to the highest rental stream. This is especially true at our highest quality centers.","Portfolio sales ended the third quarter at $659 per square foot. This represented a 5.3% increase on a year-over-year basis. On a same center basis trailing 12 month sales were up 3.2%.","The third quarter represented the first period that Broadway Plaza is included in the leasing metrics since into completion in 2016. When the redevelopment began sales from Broadway Plaza were equal to $726 per square foot. Current sales are now $1278 per square foot ranking this as the third most productive center in our portfolio.","Specialty store failures moderated during the third quarter with four tenants declaring bankruptcy. Equally as important, during the third quarter the bankruptcies of True Religion, Rue21, Gymboree and Payless Shoes were resolved through a restructuring of the company rather than liquidations.","Since the start of 2014 within our portfolio approximately 900,000 square feet is closed from bankruptcies. Despite these headwinds, our occupancies remain stable. During the same period our occupancy is declined by only 30 basis points. We believe this illustrates the underlying strength of our assets and the importance of the markets they serve.","Critical to the success in replacing these locations is diversifying from our traditional tenant base by attracting new users and new uses to our shopping center. New and emerging brands either digitally native or store based are being added and often our customers new experiences when they shop at the centers.","A partial list of brands that had no previous locations with Macerich in 2014 and now have stores many of the multiple stores operating at our centers include Aesop, ALEX AND ANI, Amazon Books, Aritzia, b8ta, Ballard Design, Blue Nile, Drybar, Dyson, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Fry's, Kendra Scott, Monica + Andy, Morphe, Nespresso, NYX, Peloton, Sage, Shinola, SoulCycle, Superdry, UNTUCKit and Warby Parker.","We believe the demand from these emerging brands validates the desire for retailers to expand with brick-and-mortar locations in the premier centers and the Gateway markets across the United States.","There are currently two development projects in process. In Philadelphia construction leasing is well underway for the fashion district Philadelphia. This merchandise mix is evolving based on demand from the retailer community. In response, the development will be a combination of outlets, larger format of boxes, entertainment as well as full priced flagship retailers. We view this is as a very unique opportunity to redevelop four city blocks in downtown Philadelphia.","The redevelopment of the former Sears building at Kings Plaza is proceeding and ahead of schedule. Three of the four spaces are undersigned leases. Leased for this final space is nearing completion. This will bring the project to 100%. We anticipate all four retailers will open in the second quarter which is ahead of the original schedule a fall 2018.","And with that I'll turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thanks Bob. Thanks Tom.","As you can tell from the facts that our operating results, our company continues to be - to perform at a very high level. However many folks tend to look at the glass as being half-empty instead of half full. Why is that? That's because there is a major negative sentiment that we all know about retail, about our sector and about our company.","And after thinking about sentiments, so I looked at the definition of it and one of the popular definitions is that sentiment is a thought or view or attitude based upon emotion but not reason, emotion not reason. The facts are that our malls are counts were in high demand for retailers, they\u2019re places of preference for shoppers and they are performing extremely well.","So what creates this negative sentiment? Well to a great extent it is the social media. Social media that is driven by folks that have somewhat of a contrarian a conflict of interest. Maybe they are bank stock, maybe there are hedge funds. And course every time that a retailer goes broke it's always blamed upon e-commerce as being the reason.","In fact the reason with tenants tend to fail is because their brand has become irrelevant. They may be over levered and yes to some extent digital commerce may have accelerated their depth. In our company - in our portfolio the companies that have gone broke over the last couple of years averaged about $250 per square foot and they paid rents that are about 40% to 50% below the average rent in which they had stores.","Look it's true that retail is being disrupted by digital commerce but is usually the retailers that should be disrupted. As I said before in my view and I'll talk about this a little bit later, digital commerce is our friend. It is a breeding ground for new businesses and this will be the businesses that will fuel the excitement in our portfolio going forward.","Want to talk a little bit about the broader retail landscape. Much has been talked about the fact that there is too much GLA in the United States. That's true but why doesn't that bother in. Our portfolio is over 90% driven by town squares that represent and that occupy a place in the top 300 malls in the United States.","If you look at those top 300 malls in the United States, you're looking at square footage that is about one half of 1% of all of the GLA in the United States and when you add in high demand street retail locations and other great retail locations, they occupy a place that is in the top 2% or 3% of all of the GLA in the United States. That's why we have a very confident view on our future.","That's true that malls are evolving but that's good. If they were not evolving then they would in fact be a true to the social media that the mall is dying. But great malls in great locations are evolving.","If you think about the way malls were built going back 20 or 30 years ago, the profile generally look like this. They were suburban and location, amazingly 100% of the GLA on those properties was apparel. There was no food in those malls, there weren't even any public bathrooms in those malls, there were very few amenities, there was no entertainment, there was no mixed used they were all full price but they did well.","But why did they do well? Because it didn't have any competition. So now it's competition has come from the digital landscape, as well as from people like Walmart then going back to digital Amazon, these malls did have to evolve in order to survive and the ones that are going to thrive of the ones that we own. These are now town squares and their profile is, they are in urban locations, a tremendous number of the properties that we own were never suburban. They were built in the middle of cities. They are in the last mile of distribution. They have a lot of food options in these centers. There's lots of entertainment - location based entertainment whether it be theaters or destinations such as Legoland Crayola and other themed retailers.","There's a tremendous amount of amenities in the properties. There are lifestyle uses, uses that are - such a SoulCycle, Equinox, Life Time Fitness, yoga and other uses of that nature. There is a tremendous amount of health and beauty in these malls in these town squares and there will be more. We didn\u2019t use to have that in the malls that were built 20 years ago. There's home furnishings and accessories for the home, retailers like Restoration Hardware used to be for home you had to go inside of a department store.","There's the whole category of athleisure which didn't exist as recently as 10 years ago. Inside the malls and attach to the malls there are sporting goods which used to be found only in side of Sears. Today we have great sporting good retailers such as Dick's that occupy space.","There are mixed uses that want to be in these towns for us. Whether it be office, residential, medical, hospitality. There are major food users, such as Eataly. People like specialty food users, like whole foods, food halls and groceries.","These centers that we own are the new town squares or the new downtowns if you will. They are the preferred homes for the omnichannel digitally born vertically integrated retailers that are being born in the digital world today. So let's talk about the future occupants of these malls and these are the digitally born vertically integrated retailers.","We spent a tremendous amount of time researching and surveying the landscape. We identified through a variety of criteria over 400 digital retailers that currently are doing business that we would like to do business with.","We then engaged with these retailers with an outside research firm and energy firm who would interview the founders and the CEOs of these companies. And the answers came back that they all want to be omni-channel which means that they want to gravitate towards brick-and-mortar over time.","The stores that they want tend to be the types of malls that we own they are all brands that are extremely well defined in the stores that they have opened or their expectations for the stores they average over $1,000 a square foot in volume. They have integrity to their profit margin because they are vertically integrated.","These will be the tenants that will make our mall exciting these emerging tenants will be the next generation superstars in our portfolio in terms of what they will produce for us whether it be sales productivity which will be high as a consequence of that they will be able to pay rents which are significantly higher than the retailers that are leaving us. They will generate a tremendous amount of traffic and they will be the heart and soul of the social network of our malls.","With that we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Just a first question for Tom just in terms of the balance sheet leverage continues to pick up a little bit and I was just wondering if you could talk about when you project that to begin heading lower here?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Actually if you had some measure other than debt to market cap it wouldn\u2019t really be moving up Todd, we\u2019re not levering up to do the buybacks, we\u2019ve not seen a great degree and we do have one asset under contract for sale right now when that closes up we\u2019ll probably use to paydown some debt.","So when we look at most of the metrics average debt maturities is going to be close to six years or higher we don\u2019t lot of significant debt come and do the next few years. The coverage ratio is as strong as it\u2019s ever been at 3.4 times.","So I don't too hung up looking at just debt to market cap by anybody measure debt to value would it be under 40%. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with where our balance sheet is today that being said we do not plan to lever up to do buybacks for example.","Todd Thomas","And then just a follow-up if I could sneak one in there, how much - in terms of the buybacks I mean how much more capacity and appetite do you have to do future stock buybacks from here?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well we have an authorization that was announced earlier this year of 500 million and we had 220 million so we got us to about 220. And one thing we have said and we remain true to is that we would only fund buybacks through non-core dispositions, the equity that would come from assets that we deem to be non-core. In this context it's usually not retail.","In terms of our appetite going forward I would say that given our view of our total opportunities within our portfolio including our redevelopment pipeline and the appetite to bolster and create firepower for the future that our appetite for stock buybacks may diminish a little bit over time. But we\u2019ll be reviewing that literally on a weekly basis with our Board of Directors and others.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Schmidt, Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Is there any update on your Seritage joint venture?","Art Coppola","The update is that we\u2019re working well with each other. We have nine centers, nine serious locations together and we have a number of ideas that we\u2019re continuing to work on together and the - I\u2019ll say the plans are advancing nicely I think there's more definition to what we see the opportunity to be and it appears that you know our view of those opportunities. And hopefully our ability to get access to those locations a 100% may coincide in terms of timing.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Actually look at the loan you sourced - were those with the existing lenders and the loan to value change or just a value chain on those assets?","Tom O\u2019Hern","They were not with existing lenders Green Acres Commons is unencumbered, Inland Center unencumbered. As I said one was bank loan, one was a life company loan and two were CMBS. And really the loan amount was based on a - what will be at the most efficient pricing which is typically between 50% and 60% loan to value. We\u2019re not terribly proceed-sensitive when we\u2019re rate sensitive.","Wes Golladay","And then looking at the west side the billion, I see it still in the redevelopment platform but it look like they might have been handed back to a special servicer. Do you have any updates on that asset?","Tom O\u2019Hern","The loan is current - it has moved over to a special servicer but that really just means that the special services is paying more attention to the loan because it\u2019s public knowledge that Macy's and Nordstrom both are going to close.","But the loan is fully current and in term of what our plans are for the asset as the department stores announced their plans which we learned about for years, look it\u2019s a great piece of real estate and we received interest from ton of LA-based real estate developers, as well as other real estate developers that would love to be involved in the asset.","If I had to prognosticate what will happen there, my guess is that within a year or less we will no longer own the asset because somebody will have an idea to do either a mixed-use or totally nonretail use there that will likely be the highest the best use for a great piece of real estate and that will result in us getting value from it that we otherwise couldn't get in holding it is as a retail facility.","So just testimony again to here you have a mall where two of the two department stores are consolidating to another location and because it's great real estate they\u2019ll \u2013 create a amount of intrinsic value.","Wes Golladay","On that point would there be not a lot of NOI if has to that loan right now?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Today there is a not lot of NOI I mean I think there - those are public members but its diminimus, it's less than 1% of our EBITDA.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","I just wanted to touch based on the same-store guide 3% to 4% does imply a pretty big ramp in the fourth quarter which I think you benefit from an easier comparison year-over-year. But I\u2019m just curious what the other drivers are what sort of the uplift expected in the fourth quarter?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well Vin we\u2019re at 2.9% year-to-date. So to get to the bottom end of the range just got to have about a 3.2% gross in the fourth quarter and as you pointed out we\u2019re going against the relatively easy comp.","Typically fourth quarters our strongest quarter in terms of NOI, we\u2019ve got a lot of variables that roll through in the fourth quarter some of which are harder to predict roughly 60% of our percentage rent comes through in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s a little bit harder to predict.","Lease term fees we\u2019re working on a few some of those may happen in the fourth quarter, some may fall into the first quarter of next year that could impact the number. Advertising revenue which tends to come in the fourth quarter and there is not a lot of lead time to that.","But that's heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, as well as tenant leasing about 40% of the temporary tenant leasing happens in the fourth quarter. So there's a lot of variables that could push us within that range in the low side as you said three in the high side up to four for the year.","Vincent Chao","And I could ask one more just in terms of the financing for good malls you said it was quite good. As you think about future non-core sales, how was the financing market change for the lower quality stuff?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well we really haven't been in that market. I mean most of the assets we've got in our portfolio that we would consider financing are rare quality centers. And there this is pretty strong appetite in fact we are very happy to see a strong CMBS market as was evidenced by the Santa Monica place financing and that was competing with life companies but CMBS came through with the best quotes. So it\u2019s a good that if that market is there at least for high quality assets and I\u2019m really not the right person to ask on B mall financing.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","I was wondering can you talk a little bit about Philadelphia preleasing level you talked about few different types of tenants who were in there how the mix is allocated towards those tenants. And then lastly over what timeframe will it take that asset to stabilize do you think?","Art Coppola","I think we've identified today that there is going to be a mix of types of retailers that are going to be there actually a lot of the retailers are really excited about the mix and feel this could be kind of a paradigm for the future beyond that look we have a partner there too and we would need to coordinate any releasing on actual answers to stabilization et cetera.","Look our original prognosis on the center when we did our market research studies was that it was going to be a very high producer in terms of sales per square foot we still believe that, but given the nature of the project I think we've indicated that we seriously doubt that we will start putting out names and leasing statistics probably for another four to six months so we said that before.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just a question and a quick follow-up if I may first on the Broadway Plaza the redevelopment the sales jump that you guys talked about it\u2019s in your supplemental how much of that is just merely not merely how much of that is from the redevelopment having the figure traffic draw with this Canadian same tenant base versus REIT getting a lot of new tenants and that caused the higher sales. So just trying to see if it's more increased traffic versus it\u2019s how you funded the project at pre versus post as the driver of the increase.","Art Coppola","Well I\u2019m going to let Bobby experiment on that but I have to say there has been a tremendous ","the tenant mix profile doesn't look hardly anything like it looked when we started commencement of it. We tore down the vast majority of the small shop space and everything that was left with the three department stores and a junior anchor but I\u2019ll let Bobby go ahead and mix up for me.","Robert Perlmutter","Alex I went through both those factors it\u2019s one the center having a much stronger draw mostly because of the size of the presentation the small stores. And then secondly as Art said there you can literally count on one hand the number of tenants who remain in place through this process. So we've been able to really reach out and do two things one is established the critical mass that's needed to generate higher sales.","Two, we consolidated a lot of the stores that we\u2019re already in Walnut Creek doing high volumes and brought them into the center. And then lastly and most importantly I think is we\u2019re offering contemporary brands and so well Broadway might be the most extreme example of being able to bring new brands into an existing shopping center.","We see it at many of the top centers like Washington Square where as Art mentioned we\u2019re weeding out the lower productivity tenants and using it as an opportunity to bring in the brands that are stronger and more productive and ultimately we\u2019ll generate more income.","Art Coppola","So now look we\u2019re thrilled to finally be able to share the sales productivity of Broadway look when we announced this project four years ago some people were said what are you doing screwing around the successful centers that\u2019s doing $700 a foot.","We said look this is what we do for a living we constantly think about the future we think about is this center to serve intensification and densification is the demand here so strong that we could actually consider a complete recycling of it. And a significant capital expenditure and the answer came back yes so that there is a tremendous amount of value to be created by shake it up the applecart. And we did it we started significant amount of capital, but we also believe that given the returns that we got on that capital that is generated a very significant value creation.","We took center that was doing a little over $700 a foot today it\u2019s doing over $1,200 a foot its more than double the shop offering that we had before so it just a huge success it\u2019s nice to be able to publish the results of that success.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Alex, the only thing I would add is that sales number does not include an Apple store so that makes a number even more impressive.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then just a side question for Tom. You answered obviously the demand from Life Coast those banks CMBS is remain strong for good assets. Are the lenders changing the questions they are asking when they do they underwriting when they ask a different questions have you noticed that over the past year or is there underwriting and questioning then the same now as it was five years ago, 10 years ago when they had the right malls.","Tom O\u2019Hern","I mean they have always done a lot of due diligence in there underwriting, and it hasn\u2019t changed I mean they\u2019ve consistently been appreciative of the income quality of the malls the credit quality of the tenants and we don't see the appetite slowing down at all. I mean they read the headlines like everybody else, but they know that the fact that historically in a quality malls the life goes that never really lost money not many of those assets have ever been turned back to Life Coast.","And so they continue to have very strong appetite I would say they do their underwriting and due diligence with as much fervor as they always have. I wouldn\u2019t say that's it heightened yet today just as a result of the headlines I mean they\u2019re much deeper than that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christy McElroy, Citi.","Christy McElroy ","Just following up on the same-store questions just beyond Tommy touched about the seasonal uptick that you normally see in temp occupancy in the fourth quarter but last quarter. I think you talked about an abnormal uptick and sort of temporary occupancy midyear just given the bankruptcy closures and the change in the occupancy mix. How did that trend in Q3 and how should we think about maybe the conversion of some of that space to more permanent occupancy by year end I think we see the headline occupancy number but sometime we miss the new launches that are in the mix there?","Art Coppola","So in terms of the Q3 temp occupancy number it was 5.7% which is the same as the Q2. So we didn't see any change in the temp number. I think part of what Tom was referring to is probably more seasonal leasing done in the common areas in the fourth quarter for the holiday which would not be part of that temp occupancy number.","Christy McElroy ","Sure but does that 5.7 contract into yearend?","Art Coppola","I don't see its contracting I see it staying in pretty stable I mean if we look historically that number has sort of ranged from a low of 5% to a little bit over 6%. So you were a little bit higher than the midpoint but it has been pretty stable and it clearly is up from the beginning of the year based on the bankruptcies an early lease terminations.","Tom O\u2019Hern","And just to also look part of that is a business in which we are getting more thoughtful about that business and we\u2019re beginning to use that flexibility of a short-term lease to give digital retailers an opportunity to open a store with us that hopefully becomes a permanent location. So I would say that five years ago or three years ago it was kind of whoever would come and pay us rent and was reasonable as the space was waiting for a permanent tenant.","Today we\u2019re using a little bit more as a laboratory I will clearly heighten that focus going forward so the idea of having a percentage of your portfolio in an experimental mode which is kind of a new attitude that I have and we have around this I think is probably going to be a fixture at our numbers. And then as time goes on hopefully those \u2013 they\u2019ll be retailers that will be in those tests location that will gravitate to become permanent tenants.","Robert Perlmutter","And I do think that maybe the change in focus also going into 2018 is the rents that we charge for those temporary spaces we've been as Art said more focused on bringing in revenue and I think now there's an opportunity to manage that revenue and grow it better by putting more resources on what we charges these tenants.","Christy McElroy ","And then just a quick follow up you mentioned another asset for CLS I seen you\u2019re referring to the office at 500 North Michigan when is that expected to close how should we think about the proceeds. And I think you said you expect to pay down debt. Would that be just anticipate on a line of credit?","Art Coppola","Look we try not to talk about dispositions or acquisitions until they done but that got into the news the buyer has a very hard large deposit up of about 7% of the sales price that\u2019s actually the cash has been released to us. And there is a closing date that is schedule between now and the end of the year. I would anticipate they will close that won\u2019t acquire the property and the immediate use of the capital would be to pay down the line credit.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Could you talk a little bit about the evolution of the strategy for Philadelphia light it just kind of let chain from been a pure outlet to kind of more to kind of more what you're doing now how that will kind of happen whether it was more retailers driven or kind of what it was to where there was kind of market competition driven or what have you?","Art Coppola","It was totally retailer driven just listening to the market and we had a tremendous number of full price retailers that wanted flagships stores in that location and we thought about the idea of presenting a complete palette of resellers it\u2019s a lot of square footage. And we decided that it made sense to do it so demand driven totally demand driven.","Tayo Okusanya","And then if I may I just asked one quick follow-up in the past few weeks there has been a lot of just of buying of call option on Macerich stock. I'm not quite sure whether you guys have any insight into that but you could share with us about that to whether it is what it is?","Art Coppola","We have nothing to comment about that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from D.J. Busch, Green Street Advisors.","D.J. Busch","Art you made the point earlier on the sentiment and then I you provided the data point that the retailers that gone broke over the past couple years did about 250 a foot had below-market rents just taking that step further if I look at some your disclosure I would make guess that the more mature publicly traded retailers probably make up on a 20% or 25% ballpark of the merchandise mix these are the same retailers that have been a little bit more vocal about their struggles.","My question is similar to that 250 you point to how was the performance if you were breakup with those publicly trader retailers and in the bigger constituent the merchandise mix the ones that you\u2019re more bullish on and the ones that are performed well. How big is that bifurcation if you look at that breakout?","Art Coppola","That\u2019s an interesting question strangely enough it occurred to me this morning as I was looking through a supplement in our top 10 tenants I\u2019d said the difference is that look the vast majority of our top 10 tenants still have a business to run. The tenants that have \u2013 that went broke their brands stood for nothing and I would say are top tenants are much better capitalized then the ones that were broke. I don't have the breakout for you but yes it\u2019s an interesting question.","D.J. Busch","But when I look at top 10 tenants some of those ones are the ones that you have gone through a little bit of struggles but you still feel confident in the top 10 even though it doesn't represent a big percentage of the mix?","Art Coppola","We certainly don't have really in the top 10 that is on our watch list that doesn't mean that people are better in that 10 are not trying to manage their expenses and as their leases rollover there may be conversations around the idea of the moderation of rent increases.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeremy Metz, BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Art in your opening remarks you talked about how you\u2019re ascertaining these town squares and having a mix of usage. One of your peers earlier today announced the Jade is a large multifamily rated one of its assets in the Seattle area. Can you just give us your thoughts about adding kind of these alternate usage how much mixed-use to residential transportation is essential maybe embedded in the portfolio. And then if you have any plans in the near term to capitalize on any of these beyond what we're seeing in current pipeline?","Art Coppola","Well a lot of it already happened. So what I was pointing out was that when malls were built 20 years ago, you just didn't find mixed use of any kind. There were 100% retail and now with the strength of these locations, they are attracting other uses.","One of the uses that I see in our centers going forward and it may not be huge square footages but it could be 5% or so of any given mall maybe even 10% would be the idea of integrating co-working into the wall itself, not building a freestanding office building, but taking some of the less desirable shop space in a given mall maybe a mall that has a little too much square footage in the middle and dedicating it to co-working and we are in conversations with couple of companies in that space who have a very strong interest to do that with us.","And so when I look at the customer that they bring, the age of that customer and the profile of that customer and the rent that they will pay, it's a pretty attractive rededication of space. So look we definitely see the demand there for additional residential.","We see medical as being a use that's in some format that is going to be reintroduced to these malls, going back unfortunately I can tell you that's 50 years malls that were built 50 years ago used to have medical office complexes in them. I see hospitality coming in, residential adds a nice place making and can be very profitable.","Really I bring that up more in the context that as these properties have evolved they've gone from being single use apparel-only to being town squares and town squares, which are really the new downtowns they have multiple uses and so that's what we're going to have.","I don't think about it in the context of having 10% of our portfolio being residential or otherwise. I actually don't think it will be anything near that number, but you look we'll see. It's all demand driven.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","I guess a question for Bob, can you just maybe talk about the '18 and maybe '19 lease expirations and just from the conversations that you're having with tenants and I guess today maybe what percentage of your business for next year is signed and put away at this point?","Robert Perlmutter","So I would say that the conversations they we're having are really specific to the particular tenant, or the particular shopping center. Obviously, the stronger the shopping center, the more favorable the discussions are and the weaker the tenant, the more difficult the discussions are.","I would say that clearly as Art mentioned you're the retailers there are certainly using the sentiment that's out there to try to drive down their costs through renewals. So there's a little bit more friction on renewals. We have not seen major changes in terms of the percentage of tenants renewing. We've not seen major changes in terms of the length of leases and we think that reflects a very good quality portfolio.","In terms of where we're at in the business, I would say we're at a similar point in last year. Again remember 60% of our business is renewals and most of those come during the first quarter. So they're relatively far along, but with that said, there's clearly a tension with retailers trying to reduce their cost and landlords trying to increase their revenues and it comes down candidly to the quality of the shopping center.","But that tension has been there and the face of that will continue to drive strong releasing spreads and increasing average base rents in our portfolio. So you have sentiment which is an emotion or a feeling and then you have the facts. The facts are the releasing spreads are strong and the ABRs continue to grow. Next question.","Operator","Next is from Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","I know it's not a direct relationship but with the portfolio sales up over 5% year-over-year and comparable property sales up over three, is there is a good explanation for why or how the percentage rents are down both on an absolute basis and a percent of minimum rents basis. I feel like I get this questions so wondering what your response would be.","Robert Perlmutter","Our percentage rent is not a huge part of the revenue and obviously one of the things that occurs every year is you renew tenants who are paying percentage rent and you roll it into base rent. So there's a lot of different factors that go into percentage rent. Clearly while we have a small percentage of outlets, those centers do have higher percentage rent. We are able to on renewals roll percentage rent into fixed rents with higher productivity tenants.","And I think the other piece of it is it's a small number so it will tend to be more volatile year-to-year.","Caitlin Burrows","And then also just wondering before when you were talking about that they might not be on your watchlist but maybe I fell asking for lower rents because they're trying to lower their own costs within your top 10. And I notice that the scene is not actually your top 10 list of tenants but Dave obviously put out a plan to try to manage their costs as it relates to rental expenses. So I was wondering how your conversations with them has been progressing?","Robert Perlmutter","Well that's true in terms of Ascena. But remember, these tenants have leases. So while they may try to lower their rental structures based on their sales performance, they're not able to do that unless the lease is expiring and so the discussions with the tenants tends to be around expirations and renewals and that's where again it really comes back to how strong a quality center you have.","We're aware of which tenants are weaker. We're aware of which tenants want to rollback rents because of underproductive stores. Our job is to find productive stores who will pay more rents. So the discussions only occur upon their expirations. And we have a pretty good sense of which ones we need to replace and are working on it. And again, reflecting the quality of the portfolio that that puts us in a stronger position as possible.","Operator","We'll go next to Floris van Dijkum with Boenning.","Floris van Dijkum","Tom some of the other questions I had were answered already, but you brought up an interesting point on following the e-commerce tenant. Maybe if you could quantify as to what kind -- what percentage of occupancy or how much occupancy you're going to get from these new e-commerce tenants in next year or in the future in three years time?","Tom O\u2019Hern","We've really only scratched the surface since we were in the middle of the World Series I would say that in the world of bringing digitally borne, vertically integrated brands to our malls, we're probably in the top of the first innings but we see that this is good this is tremendous legs to it.","I easily could see over the next three to five years that these brands would easily represent 10% to 20% of our GLA of shop space.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hill, Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","I wanted to just get some updates from you about tenant reimbursement margins and how you're thinking about that? It look like your tenth reimburse margins still were trending up pretty nicely despite maybe a little bit of decline in occupancy.","So just wondering if you're seeing any changing in twin trends or you think the reimbursement margin is going to continue to go up?","Tom O\u2019Hern","I don't see that changing Rich. We quota a fixed TAM number with bumps in there and typically the annual increases exceed our actual increase. So there is some growth built into the existing leases and I don't see that changing going forward in terms of the structure.","Robert Perlmutter","And I think the others side of the equation has been relatively flat in terms of operating expenses.","Operator","We'll go next to Linda Tsai with Barclays.","Linda Tsai","In terms of Westside Pavilion, your discussion was interesting in the context of talking about the highest and best use for different properties and perhaps being a candidate for sales -- and assets in global markets.","Art Coppola","Linda you cut out there for a second Linda. You're coming in and out. We're not hearing the question all the way.","Linda Tsai","Oh sorry. Let me start over. Your discussion of Westside Pavilion was interesting in the context of discussing the highest and best use for different properties and perhaps being a candidate for sale. Do you see more opportunities like this across your portfolio where maybe you have a good asset and an asset in a good market but for different reasons it might not make sense to be a retail asset anymore?","Art Coppola","No, but we've known this about Westside and look Westside LA has too many malls chasing the same customer and it was due to for consolidation. We knew that Westside was going to being looking at being big part of that consolidation. We're fine with it though given that we are sitting on a tremendous piece of real estate it's the recently got the benefit of the train station opening a block away, it has been -- the path has been cleared of absorbing density on the property.","When all of those things happen to a great piece of real estate, it's quite likely that other uses are going to value that real estate more than a horizontal retail facility and we're seeing that in terms of the demand that's coming from really a tremendous number of people. So that would be it at this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. There's some interesting moving occupancy for some of your centers. I won't go through all of them, but it's something like Santa Monica and some others. Could you provide any commentary on that?","And second part of that question is you touched on it already but are you finding that the way you do these things philosophically is changing a little bit where it's more act of duration and maybe more TAAs to facilitate these e-commerce companies in the short-term that might be on the fence of opening stores?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well let me let me try to answer the capital question first and again remember that the capital discussion is primarily driven on the new leases and not the renewals and you've seen the historical numbers they've been relatively stable, but it is likely that certain users whether they're emerging brands or restaurants have the potential to increase the capital requirement.","The key to structuring those deals is to take a bigger percentage of the upside if they're successful, but that's a small percentage of the leases and so because of that we haven't seen significant changes to our capital requirements.","In terms of certain centers I think what you're commenting on is you see some occupancy fluctuations across the Board in all the quality of the centers and again I think that reflects more of a long-term approach of balancing short-term occupancy objectives with longer-term wanting to get the right hand in the right spaces and have them there for a 10-year term.","So when we talk about Santa Monica, we're talking about Washington Square, these are properties that we want to make sure we use the recent tenant bankruptcies and the early terminations to get the right tenants in the right location who are going to be successful and make the center a draw.","So we've had a space at Santa Monica which is arguably one of the best space on Third Street and it's been vacant and we're working really hard to get the signature tenant that that space deserves. And so it's a balance. In the short term we have an occupancy that's a little lower than it should be, but in the long-term, we want to get the right tenant.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks.","Art Coppola","Thank you very much for joining us. We'll see many of you in Dallas at NAREIT in a couple of weeks, and look forward to continuing our discussion. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

We will be sending out a save-the-date with more details soon.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Leasing.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thank you, Jean. Consistent with past practice, we\u2019ll be limiting the call to one hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me, John Perry, Jean Wood or Art.","It was another very strong quarter for us. We are now really starting to see the benefit in our operating results from all the major portfolio transformations we have done over the past two years. This includes the sale of 15 malls and the redeployment of that capital into more productive faster-growing assets.","Leasing spreads were good again this quarter and we saw strong yield volume on 335,000 square feet of shop spaces and the average deposit of re-leasing spread compared to the expiring rent was 17.5%.","Mall occupancy was again very high at 95.5%, up 10 basis points from a year ago, as well as up 10 basis points sequentially from last quarter. Temporary occupancy remained relatively flat at 5.3%, up slightly from 5.2% at June 30 of \u201914.","In light of the very significant retail bankruptcies in the second half of last year and early \u201815 this are very good occupancy results. Average mall store base rents increased to $53.62 that was up 9% from a year ago.","Looking at FFO for the quarter we reported this morning FFO at $0.89 per share that compared to $0.86 in the second quarter of 2014. Reflected in was $1.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as $11.4 million of expense related to an unsolicited takeover attempt and contested proxy, together they makeup $0.08 a share. Excluding those two items FFO was $0.97 per share for the quarter ahead of both our guidance range and consensus estimates.","Same center NOI during the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the second quarter of last year and year-to-date same center NOI growth is up 6.29%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rate increases and an aggressive operating cost management program put into place this year. The results through midyear have lead us to increase our same center guidance range assumption up 100 basis points to 5.5% to 6% for the full year.","As a result of the increase in same center NOI, we saw nice lift in the gross operating margin. Our gross margin increased to 69.8%, up from 67% from the second quarter of 2014. Bad dept expense for the quarter was $2 million, slightly higher than last year in the second quarter where we incurred $1.7 million of bad debt expense.","During the quarter the average interest rate was down to 3.47% compared to 4.11% a year ago, and if you look at the other balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap at quarter end was 36.9%, we had a very healthy interest coverage ratio of 3.7 times. Debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis was 7.2 and average debt maturity of 5.5 years.","And the financing market continues to be strong and we will continue to be in that market with the number of high quality assets that have been unencumbered recently and our candidates for long-term fixed rate financing. They include Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains Mall, Inland Center, as well as 29th Street in Boulder.","In today's press release we -- as a result of the strong first half results and outlook for the balance of the year, we bumped and narrowed our FFO guidance range. We increased to $3.86 to $3.94 and that\u2019s up from the prior guidance of $3.83 to $3.93 per share.","Looking at tenant sales, a good quarter there as well, the portfolio mall tenant sales per foot were up 10% to $623 a foot for the year ended June 30, 2015, that compared to $567 for the year ended June 30, 2014.","On a same center basis sales per foot were $619 and that compared up 6.5% to $581 at June 30, 2014. Again, during the period Arizona and California were top regions for us in terms of sales growth.","At this point, I would like to turn it over to Bob Perlmutter to discuss the leasing environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. As Tom indicated the second quarter leasing metrics were good. Leasing spreads for the trailing 12 months were up 17.5, occupancy rose by 10 basis points to 95.5%, sales reached $623 a foot.","Bankruptcies moderated significantly from the previous quarter and our signed leases for tenants over 10,000 square feet was strong with over 450,000 square feet signed during the quarter including three locations with H&M.","Demand from retailers for the company\u2019s mall locations and outlet venues continues to be positive. We see retailers seeking to tie in multi-channel retail opportunities and further establish their brand identity.","In addition we see emerging brand and foreign retailers entering the U.S. through store locations, which are typically on the East and West Coast and that aligns with our portfolio.","Tenant bankruptcies during the first quarter provide a significant headwind with eight national retailers declaring bankruptcies. These tenants affected 76 stores containing approximately 247,000 square feet, which generated sales of only $241 per square foot.","Included were larger chain such as RadioShack, Wet Seal, and Cache. Some of this impact has been mitigated with approximately 46% of the space either leased or approved and in lease documentation.","We have seen and expect to continue to see some retailers with larger store fleets reduce their store count. This is illustrated by Gap\u2019s recent announcement to close 175 stores. Most of these store closures are effectuated through natural lease expiration as oppose to lease buyouts.","We continue to believe the quality of the company's portfolio reduces the impact from both bankruptcies and store closures, which we believe will be felt disproportionately in the lower quality centers.","Leasing progress continues to be made at Broadway Plaza located in Walnut Creek, California. The initial portion of the first phase will open this November with 22 spaces containing 45,000 square feet. We currently have leases executed for 20 of the spaces or 91%. The remaining two spaces we expect to sign leases shortly.","Some of the tenants will be part of the initial phase and new to the include Lululemon, KIT&ACE, Michael Kors, Madewell, Kiehls, Lou & Grey, Athleta and Vince Camuto. The balance of the first phase will open in May 16 and contain approximately 150,000 square feet. We expect to make a more detailed announcement on the tendency later this year.","Significant resources are also been applied to improving the quality and revenue generation from the common areas of the shopping center. Sources of revenues include permanent kiosks and seasonal carts, as well as advertising and sponsorship.","As the portfolio has migrated to fewer but more dominant centers, these opportunities will grow and will result in improved operating margins. Through the second quarter the number of deals approved has doubled as compared to the previous year. The majority of this impact will be felt in 2016 when the lease is annualize.","An example of this has been the conversion from stationary guest service kiosk into mobile concierges, including text responses to customer\u2019s inquiries. This has not only improved the customer service, the customer experience, but has also allowed us to convert the former guest kiosk which are often the best locations within the shopping center into rent paying retailers. Another example of this is the Santa Monica Place, where the new ArcLight Theater will present significant advertising opportunities for major motion picture releases.","Lastly, to comment on sales, year-to-date sales through the second quarter have reached $623 per square foot. The increase is attributed to a couple of factors, including the improvement in many of the key tenant sales, including people like Sephora, American Eagle, Foot Locker, VICTORIA'S SECRET, secondly, to the impact of high volume retailers like Apple and Tesla, third, the closure of low-volume stores such as RadioShack, Wet Seal, and Cache. And finally the disposition of lower productivity centers.","In summary, we believe our portfolio offers retailers with key locations in major markets that serve dense trade areas. These opportunities will increase in importance to omnichannel retailers that have either existing store fleets or are attempting to build store bases.","And with that, I would turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Bob and thank you, Tom. We\u2019re very pleased with our operating results and with all of our metrics that we have put up here for the first six months. And as you can see by our guidance adjustment, we\u2019re very bullish about our future, mid-term as well as longer term outlook.","Same-center NOI is significantly above the guidance, even the high end of the guidance range that we provided at the beginning of year. And one might ask, what is the new normal as I look at it. Tom mentioned that he sees total same-center NOI of around 6% on the portfolio this year. And we\u2019re not in a position yet to give guidance for 2016 and \u201817. But we internally are expecting to see same-center NOI growth in that same range of 6% over the next couple of years or so.","And that\u2019s largely been put into place as a consequence of re-leasing activity, consequence of the margin improvement, some of which are yet to come, particularly on the revenue side. But we are very, very bullish on our ability to improve our margins. It was asked, I know, by one analyst, well have your really changed your business practices on the expense side to increase your margins. And the answer is really no.","We are fortunate enough this year to have a couple of major portfolio contracts for maintenance security for example, come up for renewal and given the strength of our portfolio and the quality of the assets and the size of the assets, we\u2019re able to negotiate significant reductions there as well as in other areas.","So we\u2019re very pleased about all of our operating metrics and the performance of the company and the outlook for the future on the leasing side. On the development side, Bob and Tom both touched on a couple of projects that are very meaningful to us. Very happy with where we are in Broadway Plaza, at Tysons Corner, you are invited to a tour that\u2019s coming up here in the near future. Residential Tower is now taking move-ins. It is currently well at least above schedule. It\u2019s currently 33% leased that we anticipated being fully leased by this time next year.","As we look at other major projects that are underway, Scottsdale Fashion Square, the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods anchor recently opened. They are doing very well. Harkins opens up later this year, same combination of additional anchors are going to be opening up later this year at Cerritos and early next year at Cerritos.","Very pleased with the impact. But the announcement in the construction and the reality of the ArcLight Cinema that\u2019s had on the third level of Santa Monica Place, which has actually also helped us to lend a signature restaurant that will be coming through the third level of Santa Monica Place and we expect it will generate tremendous amount of traffic.","At Green Acres, the leasing on Green Acre Commons, the contiguous space that we are building on the land that we acquired there is coming along extremely well. Preleasing activity both at Fashion Outlets in Philadelphia at the Gallery at Market East, coming along well as is San Francisco.","Last earnings call, we\u2019re on the heels of just announcing our joint venture with Sears on nine assets. We have been meeting with Sears and the Seritage people. We\u2019re very pleased to have the opportunity to redevelop it, to reposition those line assets. And we anticipate over the next 60 to 90 days that we\u2019ll be in position to make more concrete announcements about what\u2019s happening within the Sears\u2019 portfolio with us and the rationalization but very happy with where we sit there.","And in particular, we could be seeing pretty significant reconfigurations and remerchandising and developments available to us at Cerritos and Washington Square in particular, both great centers and centers where we have the ability to recapture over 200,000 square feet from Sears and each of them Sears controls at 28-acre parcel of land there.","We\u2019re looking at various ideas for various expansions. So very bullish on where we are, pleased with our results year-to-date. And at this point, we\u2019d like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Art Coppola","Hello Craig.","Craig Schmidt","\u2026. positions to fit into recycling capital. I just wonder how that was lining up for the second half of 2015?","Art Coppola","Craig, we really heard half of that question. Could you give us the whole question again?","Craig Schmidt","Sorry. Of course. I know that you're looking toward dispositions for recycling capital and I just wonder how that was lining up for the second half of this year?","Art Coppola","We are definitely in conversations to monetize our interest in several assets. I anticipate that over the next 30 to 60 days, we\u2019ll be in a position to provide more color on it. It will predominantly take the form of some new joint ventures on existing assets and the profile of the assets that are being looked, is really a very broad cross section of the company that if you take for example, one metrics, which would be sales per foot are virtually identical to the overall performance of the company as a whole. So the pool of assets that we are looking at, includes one asset that\u2019s in our top 10, two assets that are in our group of 11 through 20, a couple of assets that are in a group of 21 through 30 as well as couple of assets that are in group of 31 to 40. So it\u2019s a broad cross section.","We\u2019re -- let's say sixth or seventh inning of conversations. We\u2019re very gratified that the initial value indications that these institutional investors would be taking minority noncontrol positions, not only validate the boards opinion of value of the company that they reached with the assistance of its advisors back in March but actually exceed those numbers. And we\u2019re looking forward to being able to announce the results of that asset monetization activity over the next 30 to 60 days.","As we mentioned in previous calls, we will use those proceeds for whatever we determine at the time is the most appropriate use of proceeds, certainly redeploying the capital either to fund our development expansion pipeline or essentially prefunded to something that is always value accretive and always make sense. But we have also mentioned in previous calls that particularly at today\u2019s share prices, that the idea of using proceeds from the sale of assets at what we deem to be fair value through joint ventures and using those proceeds to repurchase shares at prices that we think are substantial for this account for the fair value of the company, makes all the sense in the world and as we get more clarity on the disposition and joint venture program, we\u2019ll be announcing the size and all of the pricing as well as these proceeds. And you can expect that will happen over the next 60 days.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, and then just, you touched on this briefly, but how soon do you think you can start capturing the 50% of space in your nine stores with the Sears joint venture?","Art Coppola","We have the right to recapture the 50% space today and we\u2019re just working closely with Sears as well as perspective users to come up with the right remerchandising plan at the various centers. So there will be a lot more clarity on that, that will be provided over the next 90 days. But it will be an ongoing process. In the meantime, we\u2019re getting paid over a very reasonable return on our investment, north of 6% while we\u2019re taking a look at and weighing the best alternatives for the reconfiguration and remerchandising of those locations.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Art Coppola","Hello.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey Art. How are you? The first question is on the margin improvement and, Tom, just thinking about the outlook for the balance of the year. You guys made meaningful progress from first to second quarter. Should we interpret that there will be more dramatic improvements in the back half of the year or are there some offsets that are coming up that would -- some negatives from just whatever is in the numbers that would cause the back half to be -- to have a little bit of a headwind? Because it seems like you guys are running a bit ahead of your increased guidance, so just didn't know, one, how to temper our view for margin improvement and two, if there were any offsets that we should think about in the back half of the year?","Tom O'Hern","Yeah. As it relates to the margin, the things that hit very quickly were some of the expense efficiencies that Art mentioned that we picked up and could be implemented very, very quickly. The revenue side of the improvement takes a little bit longer. It has to go through generally the leasing process, which takes a little bit time. So, I think the second half may not be as quick as the first half in terms of picking up the improvement. When we set out to improve the margins, Art indicated that over the next two years we\u2019d probably see 400 basis points of improvement. And to date through the second quarter, we are closer to 260 or 270 basis points through two quarter. So the expense I came on quicker, I would expect the balance of that to move a little slower.","Second half of the year, we do have a little bit more variability and things like percentage rents and things like that, which are somewhat of an estimate and tend to be more backend weighted. We have seen a little bit higher than average bad debt expense this year as a result of many of the bankruptcies that Bob mentioned in his comments. So there is little bit of that and that creates a little bit of uncertainty in the second half as well.","We expect to be, obviously a good second half regarding two of same center range of 5.5% to 6% and that\u2019s up fairly significantly from our initial guidance for the year, which was 4.25% to 4.75%, that\u2019s a 150 basis point pick up. As we sit here today, the bias is probably to the high side of that range we just gave but obviously less than the second quarter.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, are there any more advisory or takeover proxy costs or has everything now been fully expensed, meaning should we expect anything more later this year or everything has now been expensed relating to the proxy and the solicitation?","Tom O'Hern","To my knowledge, everything has been expensed meeting as of the end of the second quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan.","Michael Mueller","Yeah. Hi. I guess following up on that prior question. It looks like the recoveries jumped a little bit in the quarter. They popped some. And I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about what drove that? And specifically what drove the 100 basis points of increase in the same-store guidance?","Tom O'Hern","The recoveries on a same-center basis didn\u2019t really go up at that level. I think what you are seeing if you are comparing it to the second quarter of last year, as we consolidated four fairly large assets that have been unconsolidated asset before that. And the reason the recovery rate went up is because we were able to make some expense cuts to recoverable areas like operations, maintenance, security things like that.","So that's going to cause the recovery rate to go up. And obviously we had two pretty good quarters as it relates to same-center NOI growth. We are coming in at 6.2% for the year. It gives us a little bit more confidence at the balance of the year we are going to be in that new range that we published of 5.5% to 6% on average. So that's what gave us the confidence to increase the guidance for the second half of the year.","Michael Mueller","Okay. Great. And then for the second question, just thinking in terms of the earnings guidance increase, were there any offsetting factors that kind of went against the higher same-store NOI guidance?","Tom O'Hern","Yeah. We\u2019ve got a slightly higher bad debt expense for example, which I alluded to in a minute ago that\u2019s been bumped. We also tightened the range little bit. So, we took out little bit of uncertainty out of that as well. I mean, we bumped this now $0.05 from our initial guidance, which is roughly equivalent to the improvement in the same-center NOI that we\u2019ve changed.","Michael Mueller","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Todd Tom is next with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Art Coppola","Hi, Todd.","Todd Tom","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the guidance revision. I just wanted to dig in a little bit there. Can you just discuss why the guidance was actually up $0.02 at the midpoint? The increase in same-store NOI growth, I guess, for the full year alone is more than $0.02 a share, plus you added the Sears JV to the forecast, so you mentioned the bad debt expense. That's a little higher, but that doesn't sound like it is as significant. I am just trying to understand what the offset might have been.","Art Coppola","Well, Todd, 150 basis point improvements in same-center NOI is about $0.06 of improvement. We picked part of that up last quarter because we bumped last quarter as well and we also bumped the same-center range last quarter. We picked up another $0.02 share, so we are halfway through the year. We\u2019ve got decent visibility for the rest of the year, but more than 50% of our revenues in NOI comes in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter where you\u2019ve got a lot of temporary leasing and you've also got the percentage rent, the bulk of the percentage rent gets booked. So there is some uncertainty in those numbers. We are comfortable bumping it and narrowing the range and we will readdress it again after next quarter.","Todd Tom","Okay. And then the management company loss was lower sequentially by almost $7 million. I think that is consistent largely with what -- I think you mentioned last quarter, Tom, the bonus payments and some other items that hit in the first quarter. Are this revenue and expenses for the management company's operations, is that a fairly good run rate to think about throughout the balance of the year?","Art Coppola","Second quarter is a good run rate. As you mentioned, there were some non-recurring things in the first quarter that made that usually high in terms of expenses.","Todd Tom","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Tom O'Hern ","Thank you.","Operator","And from Citibank, we have Christy McElroy. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Art Coppola","Hey, Christy.","Christy McElroy","Just following up on the potential asset sales, as you think about sort of the sources and uses of capital, are stock buybacks contingent on executing on asset sales? And what level of proceeds should we be thinking about, given everything that you have in the works today?","Art Coppola","We think that from our viewpoint, funding a stock buyback with equity that comes from either the disposition of all of an asset, or the disposition of a part of an asset through joint venture is the most logical source of capital. We overly believe in the idea of borrowing money to buyback stocks. So once the joint ventures are committed and allocated and legally under contract, that would be the time that we would anticipate that if there is going to be a stock buyback, which I think there is a strong probability, that\u2019s going to be -- make a lot of sense to us. That would be the time that we would think about such a thing.","We are looking at a range of different joint ventures, but the idea that we would generate, at least a $1.5 billion or maybe even $2 billion of new cash from the joint venture activities that could be used for whatever we deem at that point of time to be the most rational use of proceeds is certainly not out of question. So it\u2019s a meaningful asset monetization, a very meaningful validation of our view on the value of our assets.","Again, it\u2019s a very broad cross question of assets. And we are not legally committed to the joint ventures at this point in time. So it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate in our mind to address or consider implementing a stock buyback until we have the certainty of legal commitments from the investors.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the same-store NOI forecast. Given the increase in your 2015 same-store forecast, I'm just thinking about your prior 2016 total NOI forecast of $1.04 billion, given the increase in your expectations for 2015, how that\u2019s changed?","Tom O'Hern ","We haven\u2019t given any additional guidance on 2016 yet, Christy. It would be premature to do that at this point.","Christy McElroy","So no update on that $1.04 billion number?","Tom O'Hern ","No.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Art, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit\u2026.","Art Coppola","Hey Steve.","Steve Sakwa","Hi. If you could talk about the redevelopment program and expansions, and just as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months, what other projects and if you can frame out for us kind of size and scope for some of those things.","Art Coppola","I\u2019m not in a position to make any incremental announcements that are not in our supplement of filing right now. But clearly, there are opportunities within the nine joint ventures that we have with Seritage for some incremental investment opportunities there. We are constantly looking at many different expansion and redevelopment scenarios at quite a few of our properties.","And our policy is that when we believe that we have a clear vision that it makes it into the shadow pipeline and when we believe that we have all of our entitlements and that we are virtually ready to break ground, it makes it into the in-process pipeline. So, I\u2019m not going to at this point speculate beyond what\u2019s in our supplemental disclosure. But there are plenty of projects that are being reviewed, that are not in the supplemental disclosure and as they pass those hurdles of projects that we want to pursue, they will be disclosed. So there is definitely more to come, definitely more to come.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, I guess, just on the outlet business. I don\u2019t -- maybe you can't speak to this either. But just sort of in terms of potential new projects as you just kind of look around the country, I mean how many more do you think you could do over the next couple of years?","Art Coppola","Our focus right now is on the execution of our project at San Francisco and Philadelphia. We\u2019ve got a lot of wood to cut there, but we are very bullish on each of them. So those are definitely in the pipeline. And beyond that, I would say the pool is limited. It would be from a competitive disadvantage in our view for us to put a number on something, but it\u2019s a limited pool.","We\u2019ve always said that if we at the end of the day own 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of these after 5 or 7 years of being in that business, given our requirements that they would be dominant centers that we think that would be a great accomplishment. And so I would not forecast that we\u2019re going to be announcing any new wins anytime soon other than those that are currently in our disclosure. And those are both great projects and we are very happy to have those opportunities.","I did allude to the possibility in a previous call that we could be potentially looking at an expansion of Chicago, the Fashion Outlets of Chicago somewhere down the road, but that\u2019s speculative at this point in time, and it\u2019s still possible but speculative.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And from Deutsche Bank, we have Vincent Chao. Please go ahead, sir.","Vincent Chao","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wondering if you could maybe provide some more color on the sales trends that you are seeing, which seem to be accelerating, the tenant sales growth in your portfolio. It seems to be a little bit at the odds with some of the macro sales data we see, which is sort of slowing.","But just wondering if maybe you could provide some color on sort of categories you are seeing the most strength from and also maybe more recent trends from the quarter as opposed to on a trailing 12-month basis.","Robert Perlmutter","Well, I think from a category standpoint, some of the stronger categories have been home furnishings, jewelry, athletic apparel, and athletic footwear, those would be some of the strongest. Regionally, the West Coast and Arizona has led the sales increases.","As I mentioned, what we see principally in terms of sales growth is many of our core tenants that occupy space in almost everyone of our centers, I think I mentioned some like Sephora and Victoria's Secret and Foot Locker, they have had very good sales trends. Kay Jewelers is another one that had good sales trends.","And then you do have the impact of the unique high volume retailers like Apple and Tesla. I think the weakest part of the market has been the apparel, and that is important for the malls because they do occupy a significant portion of the mall space. And that\u2019s probably been the softest part of the market.","Art Coppola","And just to follow on to that, you could easily have a macro environment where ICSC or whatever other resource that tracks retail sales, they could come out and say, hey, retail sales were flat every quarter for the next three years and they wouldn\u2019t be out of the question that even in that environment, you would see strong sales increases within a portfolio of well located regional malls.","So the source of that is essentially what we do everyday which is constantly on the lookout and for opportunities to replace lower producing tenants with higher producing tenants. And that\u2019s a big driver of sales performance increases in a well located mall portfolio.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, and that last comment sort of maybe addresses this question as well. But just trying to understand, so the rising sales growth environment seems to suggest an improving environment for the retailers in your malls, but the bad debt expenses is going up. So maybe that's just part of that churning process, but curious if you had some comments on that.","Tom O\u2019Hern","Yes. That is churning. And when you look at some of the retailers that filed bankruptcy and went out, those were some fairly stale concepts. I don\u2019t think it was a surprise to anybody to see RadioShack file and close stores in the same way with Wet Seal. They have been through the process a number of times. So it\u2019s kind of out with the old tired concepts and in with the new concepts, which by the way the new concepts are taking a lot more space than the failed concepts are giving back.","Art Coppola","Bad debts from dying concepts is really a positive canary in the coal mine of good things to come, because it\u2019s a precursor of the replacement of tenants that are doing well below the mall average with tenants that are doing. We always seek to bring in new tenants that will do better than the mall average.","But even if you bring in tenants that are doing the mall average, you are going to increase the overall sales of the portfolio. So sales of bad debt from low producing tenants, which that\u2019s what we are looking at here and it\u2019s almost always what you\u2019re are looking at, is really a precursor of good things to come in a well located mall portfolio, which is what we own.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will take Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good afternoon.","Art Coppola","Hello, Paul.","Paul Morgan","The same-store line numbers that you gave, is one way to think of it that, as we look into the rest of this year, it\u2019s been largely an expense story in terms of some of the initiatives you talked about earlier?","And then, as you said, you can do 6%, you think, maybe in 2016 and 2017 as well. As the expense savings anniversary, would we -- to get to that number going forward, is that when kind of revenue initiatives will start to kick in? Is that one way to look at it?","Tom O\u2019Hern","Well, that\u2019s certainly part of it. I mean, if you look at this quarter, I would say this quarter for a second, we had about $4 million of savings on the expense side on the same-center basis. So that equates to about a 180 basis points or so on the same-center numbers.","So that brings you down into the 5% range, which is a healthy growth rate. And that\u2019s before some of these new assumptions coming on the leasing side and other ancillary income. So if you look at this quarter, you can certainly see the impact of the expenses, but that still leaves us at a fairly high level of same-center NOI and that\u2019s before some of these new initiatives kick in.","Paul Morgan","Okay. And then my other question, just in terms of the joint venture, so, I mean, could you just help give some color -- I mean you have talked about over the past you pursue the advantages of buying out JV partners in some of your top assets. And this is kind of -- this would seem to be going the other way. Obviously, the buyback is a potentially strong use of proceeds, but is that just it, to provide a data point evaluation and potentially buy back the stock? Or are there other reasons?","Art Coppola","Well, there is certainly any of the new or expansion of existing relationships or the addition of new partners. We are clearly having strategic conversations with them and seeking to do business with people that see the world the way we see the world. Coming out of say March, we had a tremendous amount of interaction with our shareholder base. And our shareholder base really communicated to us that the only way that they felt that we\u2019re going to -- that they\u2019re going to be able to update their thinking to be more in line with our thinking in terms of the NAV of the company was to monetize some assets.","If there were not such a large discrepancy between what we perceived the value of the companies would be and where it is currently trading, our appetite should pursue those monetizations would be diminished a little bit. But given the current very large discrepancy between where our stock is trading and where we see the value of our company, and in response to really a request from our shareholders that of kind of show me the money request, that\u2019s why we have pursued the monetization and we think we have very, very attractive use of proceeds.","So we are not doing it for optics only, we just think it makes all the sense in the world. And we are clearly not taking the cream of the crop and using that to then average down in terms of the quality of the company. We are taking a very broad cross-section of quality that\u2019s representative of the company overall. And we are convinced that when we announced that deal, when we announced the valuations attendant to that deal, it will give people a lot more visibility and confidence into our view of the value of our assets and help them to update their own thinking. And again, at this point in time compared to a few months ago is that we have a really attractive use of proceeds.","Paul Morgan","So you are structuring it intentionally so that the portfolio sort of reflects -- is reflective of the quality of the rest of your portfolio?","Art Coppola","Yes. We don\u2019t wanted to look like -- we don\u2019t want people to be able to look at it and say well that\u2019s not really much of a litmus because I will use an extreme example. You did joint ventures on your top three assets in the company and you did it a sub 4 cap rate and they will say of course it\u2019s worth of sub 4 cap rate, but does it mean for everything else.","So we really decided that look we would take a very broad cross-section of assets that are really -- when you take a look and if you are going to use sales per foot as the measure to compare that pool of assets to the company, the sales per foot of the asset that we\u2019re looking at doing these joint ventures on is extremely similar to our average sales per foot that\u2019s in place for the company as a whole today.","And I mentioned in my opening comments where the assets sat, given the way that we rank our properties. You can see that it is a broad cross-section that hopefully will give people and it\u2019s a sizeable cross-section in terms of dollars. It will give people hopefully an updated data point, which is really one of the challenges that the mall industry has is that you have very few data points to look at for people to stay up-to-date on where the private market is valuing these assets.","And even with these joint ventures for example, you\u2019re still not getting a true sense of the value. It\u2019s still less than the true value because it\u2019s a minority position that has no control and the control position or 100% position of a great mall would always trade for more than what a minority position we trade for.","Paul Morgan","Great. Thanks.","Art Coppola","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we have Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets next. Please go ahead.","Art Coppola","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich Moore","Yes. Hi, Art. Good afternoon, guys. The first thing is the line of credit, Tom has a balance of $767 million, I think that\u2019s down from $852 million last quarter, but you added the Lakewood mortgage, so that should have shaved some $400 million. And I look at that now that $767 million and I\u2019d say, are you going to be able to reduce that further? Is that part of the user proceeds from the joint venture sale and that kind of thing? Or are we going to run more in the $700 million range going forward?","Art Coppola","Yes. Rich, you may have missed this. I made a comment early in my comments that we currently have four pretty significant unencumbered assets, Fresno Fashion Fair, South Plains, Inland, Twenty Ninth Street for example and there is others, but those alone are $800 million of refinancing proceeds at a comfortable 50% or so LTV. And the anticipation is that we will gradually as market conditions allow finance those and that capital can be used to pay down the line of credit.","We really don\u2019t have a lot of floating rate debt on the books, so we haven\u2019t been a huge hurry, but that\u2019s financing out there in Fresno. We\u2019ve been in the market getting bids and others would finance out pretty quickly, particularly in the CMBS market. So that\u2019s the plan there, at least at the moment.","Rich Moore","Okay. So, just as those mortgages come due, you\u2019ll get higher user proceeds, higher proceeds and pay down some of the line?","Art Coppola","Right.","Rich Moore","Okay. And then the other thing is other income guys, was also up pretty strongly this quarter and I'm curious, I am thinking about it sequentially. And I'm wondering if that sort of trend continues as well and is some part of the sustained margin improvement.","Art Coppola","Well, we certainly hope so, Rich. I mean that tends to be parking revenues, advertising revenues, things like that and was up a bit and that\u2019s a goal is to continue to push those type of answer that revenue will drop right to the bottomline and improve the margin.","Rich Moore","Okay. So those could continue as well?","Art Coppola","We certainly plan on that.","Rich Moore","Great. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Art Coppola","Thanks, Rich.","Tom O'Hern","Thanks.","Operator","And from Jefferies we have Tayo Okusanya. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Great quarter and really nice to see. Just I may have missed this earlier on, but was there any more update on Candlestick and The Gallery in particular?","Art Coppola","Just made some general comments that pre-leasing activity is going on very well and we\u2019re very bullish on both of them.","Tayo Okusanya","On both of the projects. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey there.","A - Art Coppola","Good afternoon.","Haendel St. Juste","How are you guys doing? So, Art, a question for you, I guess, at our recent NAREIT Meeting, you mentioned that you've resumed marketing your bottom 10 or so lower-tier malls. So I wanted to clarify, first, that those malls were separate from the JV conversation or JV comments you were making earlier. And as part of that, can you give us a sense of the status of that sales process, and any color on pricing or any other detail you would be comfortable to provide if?","Art Coppola","Yeah. We did get a lot of inward increase about those assets, but unfortunately a lot of those buyers are essentially trying to, instead of just making money, they\u2019re trying to improve their optics and so they\u2019re trying to cherry pick things. And I still see as over the next five years not owning our bottom 10 assets. But over the next six months, my suspicion is that we might sell one of them and we\u2019ll see where that goes. The pricing on that particular deal is, I think, in the low 60s or somewhere down in terms of cap rate but we\u2019ll see.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Fair enough. And I guess \u2026","Art Coppola","And a very high, Haendel, just to clarify a little bit. Look, we have an appetite to give people clarity on the value of the company and in our view, if we can sale a joint venture interest at a higher multiple than you can buyback stock that\u2019s kind of a no-brainer. And it\u2019s a very appropriate use of capital, especially if it\u2019s a broad cross section. And we have absolute certainty and confidence that we will execute on the joint venture side.","Dispositions by their very nature, I\u2019m just being agnostic and I believe them when they close. Otherwise, I just don\u2019t even try and predict. So, we really decided that while that is the source of capital for us, it really only represents 5% or 6% of our NOI. So it really doesn\u2019t give you any guidance to the value of the company, if we sold all 10 of them.","And given that our portfolio transformation is really already complete with 95% of our NOI coming from fortress assets, there is no compelling reason to do it there either. The whole idea of the reverse leverage where some of your weaker centers hurt your better centers is behind us now and our better centers are no longer being homogenized down which can tend to happen. And that\u2019s one of the reason that you continue to see this double-digit releasing spreads that we have been reporting to you. So, that\u2019s kind of been the thinking.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Listen, I certainly appreciate the additional color there, and as well as the thought process on the JVs and the expectation of higher values. But have you thought of, or perhaps how would you respond to those who might view this potentially as a potential form of a takeover defense? Curious on how that sort of went into your thought process here on the JVs.","Art Coppola","Well, I\u2019ve always maintained that the best defense against the takeover is to outperform your peers. And as it falls into the bucket of giving us the ability to outperform folks, well, I guess you could call it that but it\u2019s just good business. So, a good business is considered to be a deterrent to somebody wanting to buy your company then you could consider that. It\u2019s just good business.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you.","Art Coppola","Hello.","Ki Bin Kim","Hi. How you guys going. So, I realize value is a lot of times in reses in the eye of the beholder and even consensus estimates for NAV are somewhat all over the place. But I am just a little surprised that you are intending to do a stock buyback, and I understand if you're going to sell assets at $623 of sales productivity at a lower cap rate and buyback stock. I understand that math.","But when I look at consensus NAV or even my NAV, as I say, consensus is at $78. And some of those estimates include a quasi takeout premium. It just doesn't seem like the best use of capital, maybe not a bad use of capital, but maybe not the best thing to do, especially with your development pipeline that is pretty big and you have a serious joint venture to fund. So just curious to know, maybe it comes down to what your NAV is versus what I think your NAV is, but why buyback stock? And why is that a top two or three best uses of capital?","Art Coppola","We haven\u2019t announced that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing but we clearly have indicated to you that it\u2019s on the table. And we\u2019ve given you a timeframe that you could expect that it could be announced. As to -- if we believe that our NAV with $78 of share, this company would no longer be in existence, it would have been sold, we clearly don\u2019t believe that.","And I emphasize with those that try and calculate NAV on companies like ours because other than ourselves who gives you sales per foot by property and analyze by every 10 property, so you\u2019ve got really a pretty darn, 95% of the roadmap that you need to get to the NAVs that we view the company that we work. You still have the problem but you don't have a lot of transaction in this space because these properties -- assets are so dear.","And so I empathize with those that struggle with trying to come up with NAVs. And we\u2019re going to try and help you to rethink your view on NAVs by showing you some transactions that involve the substantial pool of assets that are a broad cross section that are at substantially lower cap rates than what you all are using to get through your collected consensus of $78 bucks. So that\u2019s the best I can do.","And that comes from meeting with our shareholders, okay. So meeting with our shareholders, we ask them in terms of our strategy going forward. And there was clearly a view that the strategy is something that made sense. And that actually transacting on some dispositions or joint ventures was more meaningful than even for example, posting a third party\u2019s opinion of the NAV of the company, which people could believe or not believe but real transaction speak for themselves.","And so this really comes from an outreach program to shareholders that control well over 90% of our company. And it was a consensus view that that was something that our shareholders wanted to see. And in some cases it was instigated by them. In other cases, they concurred with the idea.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing and additional remarks.","Art Coppola","Thank you for joining us. Again, we\u2019re pleased with our results. We\u2019re not sitting back and going to rest on our laurels. We are very bullish in our ability here to continue to put up outsize growth over the next several years, both from an operational view point, as well as from a value creation view points for our development, redevelopment pipeline that\u2019s currently there and as it gets expanded. So look forward to speaking with you, seeing you and thank you again for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a Question-and-Answer Session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions.","I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded and would now like to turn conference over to Miss Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Miss Wood.","Jean Wood","Hi. Thank you everyone for joining us today on our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. During the course of this call management will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to uncertainty and risks which are associated with our business and industry.","For a more detailed description of these risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s press release and SEC filing.","As this call will be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that the passage of time can render information stale and you should not rely on the continued accuracy of this material. ","During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that defined by the SEC Regulation G. The reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the press release and a supplemental 8-K filing for the quarter, which are posted in the Investor section of the Company\u2019s website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman of the Board and Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","","Thank you, Jean. Today we are going to be discussing the second quarter results, our capital activity and our outlook for the rest of the year. ","We continue to see strong improving fundamentals in our business. Retail sales had another strong increase and same \u2013center ROI was positive for the tenth quarter in a row. ","The re-leasing  spread showed double digit increases again, in addition, occupancy was up 30 basis points compared to a year ago, at a very healthy level of 92.7%.","During the quarter we signed leases for 266,000 square feet, average starting run of 45.64 and a positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 165.","The occupancy of 92.7% was up 60 basis points sequentially compared to the March 31st occupancy level, a strong gain for the quarter.","Occupancy cost as a percentage sales came in at 12.7 for the trailing 12-months. That\u2019s down compared to 13.2 at June 30th of last year. ","FFO adjusted which excludes the impact Valley View and Prescott was $0.74 a share. The operating results for the quarter included same-center NOI excluding termination revenue and SFAS 141 was up 2.9%.","Management company expenses were up for the quarter at $23.7 million. However, that has to be looked at on a year-to-date basis due to timing differences. Year-to-date, management company expenses are $46.3 million compared $46.7 million for the same period of last year. ","Valley View Center had been in receivership since mid-2010, it was sold in April and concurrent with that sale the debt and all accrued interest was forgiven. We booked an extinguishment of debt mean of $104 million.","In May, Prescott Gateway was conveyed to the lender in a deed in lieu transaction and a $16 million gain on extinguishment of debt was recognized.","Those gains on debt extinguishment on Valley View and Prescott are not included in AFFO. ","Looking at our balance sheet, our debt-to-market-Cap at quarter end was 40%. Net-debt-to-EBITDA was 7.3 times and our interest coverage ratio in the quarter was 2.6 times. ","It continues to be a great financing market but extremely low rates and a significant amount of capacity. We are taking advantage of this market. We began 2012 with an average debt maturity of 3.2 years. As a result of the refinancing and debt reduction year-to-date, as of June 30th we have extended the debt maturities schedule to almost four years. ","By year-end we are expecting the average debt maturity schedule to closer to five years, the average debt maturity.  In addition, since the loans we\u2019re putting in place are long-term fixed rate loans, the excess proceeds are being used to pay down our line of credit. And by year-end, our floating rate debt will only be about 20% of our total debt. ","And I would expect that to continue to go down in 2012 as we move forward with our 2013 debt maturities. ","Some of the recent activity includes a $200 million loan on Chandler. That was a seven year deal at a fixed rate of 3.77%. That replaces the prior loan which had a coupon of $5.48%. ","We also closed on a $220 million loan on the Oaks. That had been a floating rate loan before, the new loan is a fixed rate 10-year deal at 4.1% interest rate.","We are also getting fixed rate quotes on Chester Field and Rimrock, two currently unencumbered assets. The proceeds from those two deals were estimated to be between $160 million and $180 million and that will be used to pay down floating rate debt on our line of credit. ","We are also currently in the market on Kierland Commons, Westside Pavilion and Deptford Mall. We expect those transactions to close in the third quarter. ","In this morning\u2019s earnings release, we maintained our adjusted AFFO per share guidance in the range of 306 to 314, our assumptions are largely the same. So for now, we are not increasing our guidance range but we will readdress that next quarter.","Looking at the AFFO split for the remaining quarters, the third quarter we estimate to be 24% to 25% of the total year and the fourth quarter would be 27% to 28%. ","Looking at tenant sales, small tenant sales per foot on a trailing 12-month basis were up 12% to $513.00 a foot for the 12 months ended June 30th. ","At this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Art.","Arthur Coppola","","Thank you, Tom. As you can see, our sales trends, our leasing trends have been very strong, which is reflective of our industry. The financing markets continue to be extremely attractive for strong regional malls and we\u2019ve been tapping into those with a lot of new activity going forward that will be reducing our floating rate debt as well as extending our maturities as Tom outlined.","On the disposition front, as Tom has mentioned, we had a lot of activity. It doesn\u2019t add up to a lot of dollars but it\u2019s a lot of activity and it helps us to maintain and really prune and refine our focus, particularly, in our Arizona markets. ","We have had assets in Arizona. We had Hilton Village, a small specialty center on Scottsdale Road. The Borgata, another small specialty center. We had a power center, Chandler Gateway, another power center, Chandler Festival Center, another, Chandler Village Center, each of which we own 50% interest in. We had a power center around San Tan Mall that we owned a 35% interest in, that we\u2019ve sold, all during the first six months. ","In addition to that, we sold our 100% of a small specialty center in Carmel, as well as one of the old Mervyn\u2019s boxes that we owned in a regional mall that we do not own. ","But when you add it all up, we have eight operating assets that we sold. They don\u2019t add up to a lot of dollars but it does give us the opportunity from a timing view point to keep our focus particularly in our important Arizona markets on our major regional malls in those markets.","On the disposition front, we do anticipate that we will exceed the total that we had put into our earlier year guidance of $300 million to $350 million. Today, we\u2019ve had total sales, our pro-rata share of about $180 million but the total sale of the assets were significantly more valuable than that because as I mentioned, we had partial interest that we were selling. ","And we would anticipate that over the balance of the year that we\u2019ll exceed total dispositions of over $400 million with total equity raise being in the neighborhood of $240 million to $250 million. We\u2019ve currently raised net equity of around $126 million from the sales that we\u2019ve had to date. ","So, we are on a path in our pruning process. It\u2019s always hard to predict exactly when dispositions are going to occur and that\u2019s one of the reasons that any year where you\u2019ve got choppy dispositions, we didn\u2019t feel comfortable amending our guidance at this point in time. ","Turning to development activities. We\u2019ve really got two projects in the ground right now. One is Chicago Fashion , Fashion Outlet for Chicago. That project is doing terrifically. If you happen to land in Chicago and you\u2019ll drive by the site there, you\u2019ll see the steel coming up out of the ground. ","The project is extremely well-positioned. We have leases, 62% of the space are completely documented in signed and another 25% or so of the space is in lease comment, in negotiation right now. The space if virtually 100% committed. We anticipate an opening of August of next year. It\u2019s on time and on budget in all respects at this point in time. And again, we think it\u2019s going to be a great center. ","As you may remember, we have a construction loan on that project, so the total equity that we\u2019ll be putting into the construction there is a little over $60 million to $70 million, give or take. And we anticipate very large, good double digit returns on the total project and of course on our equity component it will be significant. We already funded a fair amount of that equity as it was used to prime the construction loan. ","This week, some of you may have seen announcements on Tysons Corner which is the other development that we are in the ground on. And I thought it would actually be a good time to kind of reflect on where we are on Tysons, how we got to where we are and where we\u2019re headed.","You may remember we bought Tysons Corner in 2005 when we bought the private company developer [Wilmer Wright]. Immediately upon it\u2019s acquisition, we were embarked upon an expansion of the center which included the addition of an AMC Theater and entertainment wing and a restaurant wing. The redemise of an old JC Penny\u2019s store and it really put the center to it\u2019s next level of success. ","That AMC Theater is their best theater in the U.S. outside of New York City and it\u2019s in the top five movie theaters in the U.S.  It drives a very successful entertainment wing and as a consequence of that expansion we added a couple hundred dollars a square foot in sales to Tysons Corner which already was a real powerhouse. ","When we bought, Wilmer Wright in 2005, we became aware of the fact that this particular site was grandfathered in terms of the master plan and that there was an opportunity to obtain entitlement to expand the center that no other piece of land in Northern Virginia, Fairfax County was able to tap into.","So we continued the efforts of our predecessor to perfect those entitlements. And after three years of effort, in early 2008, we did perfect those entitlements and attained the right to add roughly 3 million square feet of space to the center.","At that point in time, the exercise was simple one of entitlement. Of course when the financial crisis in fall of 2008 hit the idea of working on those entitlements obviously became moot for a period of time. ","As time progressed, then the Metro Rail got legs in the Washington D.C. area and it got funded. And currently that rail which connects Tysons Corner to the Capital and will connect Tysons Corner to Dulles, is under construction. If you drive by Chain Bridge Road or anywhere near that area, you\u2019re going to see above ground monorail-type of construction.","And that rail is going to change the entire traffic patterns in Northern Virginia and in Tysons Corner. The only complaint people have about Tysons Corner today, is it\u2019s too successful and it\u2019s too difficult to get to because there are too many people coming there. ","This is going to open up the flow of traffic. That, combined with a tremendous amount of offsite improvements that we helped to sponsor and even fund, in terms of hot lanes, the new Chain Bridge Road bridge and improvements to Chain Bridge Road and, literally seven different road systems around us are going to dramatically increase the accessibility of Tysons Corner.","The Rail opens later next year. It will be fully operational, we think, and open to the public in late 2013. Current estimates are that about 8,000 per day will use the rail system. Now the rail station itself is across the street from Tysons Corner. In looking at our expansion opportunity, part of the things that we wanted to tap into and one of the reasons that Fairfax County commissioners gave us the right to expand, is that we were willing to cooperate with them and provide access to Tysons Corner from that rail station.","And together with them, we planned a bridge that would cross the road and bring passengers from the rail station over to our side of the street. We provided some land area that would provide an opportunity for buses to drop off and pick up people on our side of the street.","And so, we really opened up our front door to the rail station. The work that we are currently underway with, we decided to move forward with the construction of an elevated plaza and bridge system that will connect us to the rail station. On top of that plaza, we have plans to erect an office building, a residential tower and a hotel tower. ","When we elected to move forward on this, a great deal of the motivation was to enhance the retail experience. We think that by building this new urban environment at our front door of our center and connecting to the rail station and having this elevated outdoor plaza is going to create an environment that is unlike anything else in the district, frankly, unlike anything else in the United States. And we are fully confident that the addition of this mixed use development and the creation of an additional 5,000 to 6,000 people per day in terms of foot traffic that will either work, live or use the hotel facilities should easily translate to dramatic increases in sales per foot. ","It creates a new second level entry to the shopping center and we are extremely confident that this is going to help us take our retail asset and take it to the next level. ","When we decided to pursue building the expansion on our own, it was a joint-venture decision between ourselves and the Alaska Permanent Fund. Alaska, in looking at the numbers, felt that the development returns were so attractive that we should build it ourselves. And we concurred with them and also decided to do it in this manner, because by being the single-source developer, we can maximize the synergy of the traffic patterns between the residential, the office, the hotel and the shopping mall. ","Together as partners, we and Alaska can always decide after we have developed out the project if we want to monetize one of those elements of the project. But we felt it was important to build it on our own. We also felt though, that it was important to bring in \u201cBest of Class\u201d developers in each of those categories to deliver a \u201cBest in Class\u201d building and bring the strength of leasing that would come with their unique development expertise. ","And so you may have seen earlier this week, that we announced that we have signed development agreements with the Hines Organization to oversee the office development and they have been extremely involved in every aspect of that, value engineering, the leasing, as well as even the integration of the office to the overall plaza area and the master planning. ","We brought in the Kettler Organization which was prior developer in the Tysons District and in Washington D.C., they are one of the most respected residential developers in the D.C. market. They have over 20,000 units.  And we brought in Woodbine to be the advisor on the hotel component. ","Currently we are building the infrastructure to support the plaza and to support a podium on which the office building, residential tower and the hotel will be built. ","The burn rate that we have is about $5 million a month between now and April of next year. And the way that we\u2019ve designed the project is that come March or April of next year we\u2019ll make a determination of each of the three components, whether to continue vertical or to defer for a period of time the further construction. ","We fully anticipate that all three elements will continue to be built but if we don\u2019t like in particular where we stand on the leasing of the office building come April of next year, we have the ability to Cap-off the pad at that point in time and to not go vertical on the building until it is pre-leased to a level of satisfaction to ourselves and our partner.","So we feel that we\u2019ve approached this perfection of the entitlement in a very sensible way. We feel that owning and creating the expansion on our own is the most sensible to enhance the retail experience and to create the most value for each of the components. ","We brought in \u201cBest of Class\u201d developers, I think, on each of the three components to ensure it\u2019s success and we\u2019re very bullish about the final impact that this is going to have on Tysons Corner. The entitlements that we have on this project are invaluable compared with what it costs today to get entitlements in this district. ","And again, a lot of this was driven by the fact that we did have the grandfathered right here but it is really driven by the opportunity that was created by the rail coming to the area and by our appetite to tap into that rail.","So, as we look at the funding of this, at this point in time Alaska and Macerich are funding this all cash. You may have observed from looking at our financial filing that we have relatively modest mortgage on Tysons Corner, just over $300 million and it comes due in 2 years.","We could easily, as a partnership, when we complete this project with a very modest expansion of that loan given the current income that comes out of Tysons Corner and the income that will be coming from mixed use development finance out of the entire development costs that we will have expended.","But we feel we\u2019ve approached this in a very conservative way. We\u2019ve looked at the idea of adding mixed use elements at different centers across the U.S. At this point in time, this is the only center that we feel that we will be participating in that in an ownership capacity. And we picked, basically, a center that has a catalyst that is driven by the Metro Rail. When you\u2019re booking at one of the top five centers in the United States, in one of the best markets in the United States and the best location within that market and we\u2019re very bullish on what we\u2019re doing there but we\u2019re very cautious of the overall risks. ","But we\u2019re convinced [NAV] creation, we and our partner the Alaska Permanent Fund is going to be dramatic but most importantly, it\u2019s really going to further solidify Tysons Corner and set it up for generations to come.  And with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question \u2013and \u2013Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator instructions)","And the first question will come from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","","Thanks. Good afternoon. ","Arthur Coppola","","","Hey, Craig.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","","The retail portion of Tysons that is going to benefit, it sounds like it is not from sort of expanding that space but from, let\u2019s say, the raised traffic level, the enhancement of that entire shopping area, is that correct?","Arthur Coppola","","And what\u2019s really happening here is that right now, Tysons has a front door which is kind of the Port of Cache underneath the AMC expansion wing. And that\u2019s a front door to the first level of the center but it doesn\u2019t really have a front door to the second level of the center.","This is going to create a front door to the second level of the center and it\u2019s going to create a new entrance to the center. More importantly, it\u2019s going to create an outdoor center court that\u2019s not going to be unlike the activity that we experience on the open air Santa Monica place, in the dining deck up there.","It\u2019s going to be a public space. It\u2019s 55,000 square feet plaza area and on that plaza area, we have opportunity to activate it with retail uses. They could be festival uses, they could be event-driven uses. And I think that basically what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re creating a public space that is unique to the entire district. It\u2019s unique, frankly, I think to any regional center that we know of in the United State. ","And we are essentially creating an outdoor center court to complement our indoor center court, improving the penetration to the center, creating just another racetrack to the center in an area where the center is very successful but the anchors are not really heavily loaded either.","When we first decided to perfect the entitlement, our partner said something to us, Alaska. They said, \u201cLet\u2019s just not forget that what this is all about is protecting the golden goose that lays the eggs here. And that\u2019s the retail.\u201d Now, we haven\u2019t lost sight of that and we think that\u2019s going to be the big win out of the entire project as we go forward with this.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","","And with rents that are rolling over between now and when you start to do this project, will you be able to get paid for it because they\u2019ll be able to see that or does it make sense to sort of structure leases so that they roll over more after the event and you\u2019ve made the improvements?","Arthur Coppola","We don\u2019t have any extra-ordinary rollovers coming in that center other than there are a fair number that are coming up in 2015 and \u201916 as consequence of our 2005 expansion. So the timing should be perfect given that the new penetration is going to be in the proximity of the area where we did our 2005 expansion. ","But other than that, the lease rollover that we have in the center is fairly normal and just day-to-day. We get very solid rents there and we\u2019re very bullish on what we think the impact is going to be to the sales productivity. Adding the hotel there when you think about it, at that particular center we think it is going to help generate a lot of sales productivity and be complementary.","When we added AMC, we essentially added around 2,500 to 3,000 visitors per day that came to the theater that weren\u2019t there before and it resulted in sales increases at the center that were quite dramatic.","By adding an office tower, the workers there and the residents in the residential tower and the users of the hotel, we\u2019re adding in excess of 5,000 to 6,000 a day between permanent and the tourists visitors that we don\u2019t have today.","And add to that the 8,000 commuters and I think that\u2019s a conservative estimate, they\u2019re going to be using that rail station across the street and we\u2019re going to be the only facility that is tied directly into that rail station. ","We just think that the ease of getting to Tysons is going to be enhanced and the number of bodies that we can run through there, even as great as it is today is going to be added to. That always just translates into better daytime business and greater sales productive. And we think that the big win here is going to be in the growth of the value of the retail asset.","We think we\u2019re making good money on each of the other components but the \u201ceye on the ball\u201d is on the retail asset and keeping ourselves plugged into the Metro Rail and really maximizing the benefit of that.","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","And our next question will come from Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Arthur Coppola","Hey, Quentin.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hey there. Just one quick one on Tysons, just given where office and hotel demand is, currently it\u2019s quite weak in that market. What gives you the confidence to be proceeding with all three parts of the development at this stage?","Arthur Coppola","Well, again, as I pointed out, we\u2019re proceeding with the infrastructure to support all three elements. We\u2019re proceeding with the plaza which becomes a podium upon which all three elements will be built. And as we get into it, really our go\/no-go decision on various elements really gets more serious in March or April of next year. ","Our belief is that we will be pre-leased and we\u2019ll have demand opportunities on each of the three components that will cause us to continue moving forward. But if we find that there are headwinds and that we are not along well enough in term of the demand that we have for each of the components, we have the ability to cap-off the construction on that component and to open up the balance of the plaza with the other, say, couple of components.","You know if you take a look at the market in Northern Virginia, Fairfax County, it\u2019s got 26 million or 27 million square feet of office space. And you\u2019ve got, say 7 million square feet of class \u201cA\u201d office space. But when you break it down, there is nothing even in class \u201cA\u201d office space that compares to the 500,000 foot of office space that we\u2019re going to be adding here. ","There is not one building in all of the 26 million square feet of inventory or the 7 million feet of class \u201cA\u201d office space that remotely has the amenity package, direct access to the Metro Rail, the entire district and that goes all the way out to the Reston.","All we have to achieve is the type of rent, office-wise, that they get at Reston, and we've got a big home run. The product that we're delivering is so much better, in terms of the amenity package. If you have an office at Tysons Corner, you're going to have a hotel that you're visitors can use, you're going to have a residential tower that some of your employees can live in, you've got the ability to your workers to be able to eat, shop, to play, right next door, and then you have this outdoor plaza. ","It's the best product by far. We've met with a number of new tenants that are interested in coming. If you take a look at all of the office buildings within a mile or two within Tysons Corner, look at the name at the top of that building, chances are they're talking to us. We're not going to, when we're ready to announce our lead tenant, we will. If we don't find that we have a lead tenant at the rent that we want, the thing that gave us confidence to move forward on the infrastructure was the ability to pause, on the office tower, if we weren't where we wanted to be. We will pause, we in Alaska have made that decision. The same holds true on all three components.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. So, what kind of rent premium, given the higher quality of bill boarding, what kind of rent premium do you think you need to be at, relative to what's in the market at the moment?","Arthur Coppola","Like I said, if we get the rents that are currently being obtained at Trophy Office Space and Reston Town Center, our building is a home run. It's just north of $50.00 a foot.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","There are plenty of precedents for those types of rent. Now, we're well aware of the headwinds in the market, but there is nothing else in the market like this, period, case closed. You're talking about, we'll own less than 2% of the inventory in the markets; and it's going to be best of class in every respect. We're very confident based upon the meetings that we've had. There are half a dozen lead tenants that we've already given presentations to, and we've got plenty of time. We're going to be stingy, if we don't get the rent that we want, we can pause and continue on. We have the infrastructure ready, and we'll be, in a short time-frame to build out, when we get the right lease tenants at the right rent. Alaska is very conservative, our partner, we're being very cautious here. Our advisers, I think are best in class, and we're all very bullish in the way we're doing it, but we've built in a hedge factor. Like I said, the burn rate between now and those types of decisions is around $5 million a month, which is tolerable, and our share is half of that.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","That's great. Thanks. Then, just [inaudible] you commented on some additional development projects or acquisition projects, in terms of the outlet sector. I think New York was a market you mentioned, and L.A. was a market that you've mentioned. Could you just give us a little bit more detail, in terms of what you're looking at and what you're thinking about in those markets?","Arthur Coppola","Just that they're long-term, our business plan remains the same. That we would like to have outlet centers in the same types of markets, that we have our best regional malls. So, we have said historically, that the markets that we love to do business in are L.A., San Francisco, the other major cities on the west coast, New York, Washington D.C. corridor, Chicago, and then Arizona. Those are our six or seven major markets that we have our best assets in, and that's where we're concentrating. Those will be the markets that we likely pursue outlet opportunities, so we're under construction and opening the one in Chicago. We own one in [upstate] New York, [below] Niagara Falls, obviously. Now the expansion of Niagara Falls is coming along well, in terms of the pre-leasing; but we won't reach a decision point on that, in terms of breaking ground, for another nine months or so. The other markets, they're really on our radar screen, and we would love to be involved in those markets, we think there's opportunity, but there's nothing to report on.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next will be Paul Morgan, with Morgan Stanley. ","Arthur Coppola","Hey Paul.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Just going back to Tyson for a second. So, the economics of the development agreement, you and Alaska are continuing in terms of the ultimate investment, is to keep the pro-rata investment, in terms of the development partners. What's their position?","Arthur Coppola","Yeah. We're 50\/50 owners, in the entire project. Together, we thought about selling off air rights, and development rights to other folks, and there were a long list of folks that would have loved to have bought the development rights. We decided together, that there was, frankly, too much money to be made. Also, the execution of the mixed use expansion needed to be integrated and cross managed, and cross marketed and cross developed. ","This plaza, that connects us to the metro rail, and bridges over Chain Bridge Road, to the rail, and then creates this urban space. This 55,000 foot central outdoor space, up in the air above the current parking lot, and feeds into the second level of the shopping center, is such a key to the opening up of the second level of the center; and enhancing the traffic of the second level of the center, that common ownership was really dictated. We decided to do it on our own, and that's why we did it. ","Now, together as partners, we could easily monetize one or more of those elements down the road. Like I said, we have such modest debt on Tysons Corner today, that even at very modest debt yields, we can finance out of whatever we spend on the project in total, when that loan comes due in two years.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Could you see the way it was structured with the podium, could you see moving forward on one or two of the buildings instead of all three, based on marketing conditions. [inaudible]","Arthur Coppola","That's exactly right. We could decide not to proceed vertically on any of the three elements, and just finish off the plaza and have basically Subterranean parking in place, that will support the office building and the residential tower. Now, what's the cost of doing that? The cost of that infrastructure is probably $50 million, give or take. Look, given the time value of money, if you deferred the project six months to a year, or even two years, that's not a deal killer. The burn rate of having that behind you, because it would put you in a position where you would only go vertical when you felt the market was hot. Look, this is a once in a generation opportunity to create value. ","So, what we're really doing here is making sure that we have the connection to the rail. We're doing the infrastructure, there was huge utility that had to be done, huge ring road work that had to be done, huge off-site work that had to be done, that's all been spent to date. Then, again, the key decision point on whether you go vertical on each of the three elements, is within that March to April, May time-frame of next year.","There's no magic to that, if we decide to pause on one of the elements, no big deal. We're going to build from strength. The one that would likely be most in question probably, would be the office one. Because you\u2019re signing 10 year deals on the offer. On the residential, you're marking the market every 30 days, so timing is not critical on that.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Then my other question is just on the dispositions. You mentioned $400 million with $240 to $250 million of equity. Is that what's in your FFO guidance, and is that still all non-malls?","Arthur Coppola","The total of the guidance we gave was $300 to $350, recognizing that we'll try to sell some assets that may not sell, and there may be others that we initially weren't sure would be in the mix, that are. There could be a mall or two in there. We said that we're not just selling urban villages but other assets, so there could be a mall or two in there.","","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Did you mention $400 million or did I mis-hear that? ","Arthur Coppola","You hit the right number. Our original guidance numbers for the entire year was [inaudible] was going to be between $300 and $350, and I did comments that I felt, in fact, our [inaudible] share will be closer to $400 to $450, so it will be higher. What Tom is adding, is that there could be an interest in a mall, that was a non-core interest involved, in that sizing. We'll see.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then, last, you had the Cap rates on the deals you did close?","Arthur Coppola","Yeah. The deals that have closed to-date are just under 7%, probably 61\/2% to 7%, of blended cap rates. There are small deals. There are partnership interest in a lot of them. Overall, from an energy viewpoint, it gives us a lot of capacity to refine our focus. It was a bigger disposition than the dollars would seem to have left. Again, most all of these assets that we disposed of were in the English market place. So, this now leaves us with really, just the regional mall investments that we have there with the exception of one or two urban villages. ","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Moving on to Christy McElroy with UBS.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Hey guys. Just to follow up on that last question, with regard to dispositions, I just want to make sure I'm clear. That's $400 million to $450 million pro-rata by year end?","Arthur Coppola","That's our best estimate, yes.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","At this point you've completed $180 million, do you have anything else contracted at this point?","Arthur Coppola","Excuse me?","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Do you have anything under contract at this point?","Arthur Coppola","You know, we have a policy that we don't comment on the specifics of acquisitions or dispositions, and we find that's a good policy. That's our best guidance. That's all I can do is give the guidance, today.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay. All right. Tom, you mentioned the assumptions that are in guidance are largely the same. Can you confirm, I think your prior, same-center NOI growth guidance was 2 1\/2 to 3 1\/2. Then your occupancy guidance was up 50 basis points, is that still about right?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","That's right. The same-center NOI growth, that's excluding lease termination, and SS141 that was in our guidance was 2 1\/2 to 3 1\/2, and through six months we're at 3.1%. So, we're right there, right in the middle of the range, and that remains the same.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay. Just lastly, regarding the income tax benefit in the quarter. Just wondering what that was related to, and what you do you have in guidance for the full year, for sort of net expected tax benefit or expense?","Arthur Coppola","Yeah, you get little, that's through the taxable REIT subsidiary, Christy, and when you dispose of an asset sometimes you get a small tax, sometimes you get a small benefit. If you look at it year-to-date it's only about $1 million. That's not particularly big, and we factor in, I think based on last year, maybe $2 million of gains for the year, $2 million of tax benefit for the year. It's relatively small, and in some cases in some stores it's going to be an expense, and some stores it's going to be a benefit. Either direction it's not going to be too significant.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","So, would you stay on par with last year, about $2 million benefits?","Arthur Coppola","Yes.","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next will be Rich Moore, with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good afternoon guys. Tysons in Chicago seem like the ones you're focused on at the moment. I'm curious, more broadly, you had given us a bigger number for sort of development\/redevelopment spend over the next five years. Where do you see that at this point, I guess, annually, or over a longer period of time, what are you expecting?","Arthur Coppola","Look over the five year period, I think the numbers that we've shared with you are roughly accurate. With the exception of the possibility of us building an outlet center in the Scottsdale market place in the next five years is probably out of those numbers now. The possibility of us opening and building a full price regional mall in the Goodyear market place is probably out of those numbers, at this point in time. So, right now, I think, it's best that we focus on exactly what we're in the ground on. We're in the ground with Tyson, we're in the ground with Chicago, it's likely that we will break ground on Niagara Falls next year.","In the long-term horizon, we're still working on that entitlement at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek. That's going along okay, but it's a difficult negotiation with the city, with lots of master planning implications. I think the opportunities are out there, still along the lines of the sizing that we have talked about, with the exception that when you take out the new possible mall in Phoenix, and Goodyear, the possibility of an outlet center in Scottsdale, that's a significant amount of money. That's $300 million or $400 million in that comes out, but it was pretty much back-ended anyway.","So, at this point in time, I think the real focus is on Chicago, Tysons, and the opportunity of Niagara Falls. We'll see how the others go. We're working on entitlements all the time. It's always hard when you're trying to project out five years, to know what's going to happen. Just because you see it in your sites when you talk about it, if market conditions change and all the sudden you've got overbuilding that is being created in a market like Phoenix. You got to back away for awhile, but right now we're really just focused on the three we talked about here. With the next big one coming after that being Walnut Creek. We've still got a lot of work to do on Walnut Creek.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. All right. Thank you, that's very helpful. You know, looking for a moment at the mall business itself, how do you guys size up traffic trends, maybe more recently, even since the end of the quarter? Given that the economy has slowed a bit, here.","Arthur Coppola","Are you talking about foot traffic, or sales?","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, foot traffic, at the malls.","Arthur Coppola","It's about the same. We don't have traffic counters at all of our malls. Sales are up, and some people, on a global basis, people prognosticate that sometimes purchases per visit or [inaudible] would infer that traffic was up. Look, the malls that we own, they feel busy, they look busy, they are busy, they're productive. Foot traffic is very important, but it's hard to have a direct correlation between foot traffic and sales. I think on a macro basis, people are continually more stretched for time, and they probably tend to go to places less often, and consolidate their visits when they do go, but it varies. Every property is different. Take the traffic at the Santa Monaco place, and you can just observe that it's virtually grid-locked, in terms of the number of bodies that we move through there. The big number, the eating the paste in the pudding there, and sales are great, sales are good. That's the most important thing.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Thank you. Tom, last thing. Is North Park done? Is the refinancing of that done?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Rich, that's being handled by our partner, we're passive investor in there, and they're operating under a short-term extension now, and working with one of the existing lenders on that.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So, probably next quarter, I'm guessing that's done. Right?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","That's my assumption.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. All right, good. Thanks.","Operator","Moving on to Michael Mueller, with JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah, hi. I heard the comments about not knowing all the specific time-frames, but, if you think about Broadway, with everything really lined up and it goes according to plan, under the best scenario. What could a rough time-frame look like for that project?","Arthur Coppola","I think we talked about the grand-reopening being in 2016.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, okay.","Arthur Coppola","There are lots of things that, when we started a process, we had a certain comfort factor that the city was going to allow one level of development. Then, as they've gotten into it, they have decided that some of the public spaces that they thought they were willing to walk away from, they don't want to walk away from, so that's kind of caused us to rejigger the development. When we first started talking about the development, that's another one that in a previous call that I had said that we're thinking about the possibility of allowing residential to be built on top of the retail. As we've gotten into the process of the city, and we looked at it, we just decided that we're not going to incorporate residential into that. It's going to be a pure retail expansion. So, things are moving around. ","That's a project that we're getting paid on our land, through the rents that we give today, while we work on the opportunity to build something that's a lot better. So, it's kind of the best of both worlds. Sometimes when you look on a piece of land, you're not getting paid while you're thinking about what to build. Here you have a situation where, as we think about what to build, we've got increasing sales, we've got increasing NOI. Once we get our entitlements in order for this project to pencil out, we'll have to convince ourselves that the incremental spend is worth decommissioning and then rebuilding. Preliminary numbers say that we have a huge NAV creation possibility here, and that we have the opportunity to create one of the top centers in the United States. ","It's tremendously well anchored today, with a fabulous Nordstrom's, a fabulous new Neiman-Marcus. We've got a big Macy's that just wants to get bigger, and wants to become one of the standout Macy's in the marketplace. We've got specialty retailers that are lined up around the block that want to be there. So that's one that we're very patient, but we're actually getting paid for our patience. Then when we decide to pull the trigger, then the whole process is roughly 24 to 30 months. We think it could happen in the Fall of 2016. Frankly, it doesn't matter if it's '15 or '16, because we're getting paid to think about it.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Separately, and a little bit more of a technical question. When we're thinking about Chicago leasing, how do the leases for that project with the tenants compare to say a normal traditional regional mall lease? If we're thinking about lease terms, the escalators, are they comparable?","Arthur Coppola","Yes.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Then, last question, sticking with leasing. Any sort of update you can give us, on the Santa Monica, you're starting to turn some of the leases there. What's happening, in terms of the renewal rates versus prior rates? ","Arthur Coppola","I think I've mentioned on the previous call, every time we looked at quoting a renewal deal or replacement deal, to new tenants that are coming in. Like three people is replacing Sketchers, and we've got a couple of other new tenants that have come in.  Lorna Jane has come in replaced [inaudible]. Lorna Jane is an athletic specialty retailer out of Australia, and it's kind of a first to market location for them. Roughly, on average, the new rents compared to the old rents on the tenants that are going away, they're always above, and in some cases they're double. ","As I've indicated before, I think there's a big opportunity to increase the rent levels, as we recycle. We were leasing in the worst of times, so it's not unusual that that's the case. It's also not unusual that that's the case when you've got a really successful center, because the guys that want to come in, that are not there now, they already have the advantage of knowing what works. When they can see the volumes of peers that they have, and see the success, then, they can pencil out better sales projections for themselves, and afford to pay you better rent. When you're building a project from scratch, and you're used to having mediocre malls, it's still speculative. We thought it was going to be a big winner, we believed it was going to be a winner, turned out to be a big winner, but, it's still speculative. Until you open it, you don't know. The trend is good, solid. NOI growth there is good, we're very bullish on the future and only good things are going to happen there.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on to Steve Sakwa, with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, good afternoon. Tom, or Art, I was wondering if you would be able to, on a go forward basis, I know you used to have a table in the back, that kind of provided the development projects and the costs. As the pipeline begins to ramp up, I'm just wondering if you would be able to provide a little more detail on that CIP number, which I think stands at about $350 million, today. Would you be able to kind of just go through, and talking about some of the projects that you've mentioned, whether it's Tysons, Niagara, Chicago, maybe Broadway and some others. Could you help us just bucket how much you've spent to date on each of those assets?","Arthur Coppola","Steve, we include a lot of assets in there, but the bulk of the CIP is Tysons, Chicago, and then Estrella Falls. It's not just ground up construction, it also includes a land relating to those projects. So that's the bulk of what's in there. There are other land holdings that are throughout the portfolio, in there, there are other smaller projects that are in there. That schedule you're referring to, is kind of a throwback to the era of '07 and '08, when we were scaling back on capital spending. I'm sure we can come up with something to give a little more detail to CIP as we go forward.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group"," ","Would you have [inaudible] for those three main projects, Tysons, Chicago, Estrella [inaudible].","Arthur Coppola","Not at my fingertips, Steve. I'll have to get back to you on that. ","Thomas O\u2019Hern","I think in my comments, Steve, I did indicate that over the course of the next year, our expected burn rate on Tysons, is $5 million a month, and we have a half interest in that. If you add our total expected projections, they won, including sub costs, interest carry and everything else on Tysons. From an equity viewpoint, and add up our total equity that we're going to put into Chicago, those two primarily. From beginning to end, the total investment probably is around $350 million. Our equity components are actually, [cheaper] though. Of that, probably we've got our pro-rata share to date is under $100 million, and the burn rate is what it is. The key variable being, which element that we decide to go vertical with, [inaudible] into Spring of next year.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Could you maybe just elaborate a little more on Niagara? It sounded like you said you were nine months away from making a decision there. I guess, why is that taking so long, or what are the necessary approvals you need to make that decision?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","The land that we're expanding on, is currently a trailer park, and we're de-leasing it. So it's taking a little time. ","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group"," ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The final question will come from Jeffrey Donnelly, with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. Art, has your partner given you a sense of how the rents that you're targeting at the office tower at Tysons, compares to the rents that perspective anchor tenants are paying today? I guess I'm wondering if there's a sense that maybe some of these tenants are maybe paying above market rent. From their perspective, any kind of incremental change might not be all that much of a stretch.","Arthur Coppola","Jeff, I don't know if you've got static on your end of the phone, but for some reason we do on our end. Hopefully, you can hear me. The market rents that we are seeking to achieve are roughly in line with the rents that are currently being achieved that the other letter considered to be trophy office buildings in the market place. We think that we've got the best product in the market place, so we're confident that we can get the rents that we need to achieve. Those rents are north of $50.00 a foot.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Hopefully you can hear me okay. Then, you mentioned the burn rate, I heard your share was $2 1\/2 million a month. I guess, how long are you guys willing to carry, or are you preparing to carry that cost, before it becomes unpalatable?","Arthur Coppola","Oh, no, no. It's not going to be unpalatable. The only question would be, whether or not we continue full bore, in the Spring of next year, or we pause on one of the elements. We're very bullish about all three elements. I was really just outlining basically, how much money we will have invested, before we have to make the decision to go vertical or not.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. Understood. Last question is just concerning your cash leasing spread. From where you guys sit today, on the mall side, do you expect to maintain a similar pace of growth, as we role into 2013? I know it can move around quarter to quarter, but just trying to think what you think you'll average going forward.","Thomas O\u2019Hern"," ","Well, if you look at what we've done in the past, Jeff, we've been fairly consistent between 10% and 20%. The numbers, we tend not to give a quarterly number, because you can get quite a bit of fluctuation; so the numbers we give on leasing are on the trailing 12 months. I would say as we see what rolls forward ahead of us, it's reasonable to expect to be between 10% to 20%. ","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's fine. Thanks guys.","Thomas O'Hern","Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","All right. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the question and answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to [you], for any additional or closing remarks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to seeing you soon, and reporting to you on our progress. Thanks again, for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter 2018 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO; Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Kingsmore, Senior Vice President, Finance.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom O'Hern","Thanks, Jean. Welcome, everyone, to this, our 100th earnings call as a public company. The first quarter reflected generally solid operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our key operating metrics. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the bankruptcies and early terminations in 2017 continue to temper growth in the first half of 2018, as we expected, as we work out \u2013 work through the lease up of that space that we've gotten back from the bankruptcies.","That being said, the 2018 year started on solid footing with good retailers' sales, far fewer bankruptcies and a more balanced tone from the retailer community. FFO per share was $0.82, and that was adversely impacted by $12.8 million of severance cost in the quarter related to our first quarter reduction in workforce. Going forward, we expect to see $1 million per month expense savings as a result of that.","Occupancy was 94% at the end of the quarter. That was down 30 basis points from a year ago. The decline versus a year ago is a result of the record number of bankruptcies we saw in 2017. Same-center growth was flat for the quarter. This was again primarily caused by the occupancy loss versus a year ago. We expect the second half of the year to be strong, and we are comfortable with our same center NOI growth guidance for the full year 2018 of 2% to 2.5%.","Lease termination fees were $2.9 million for the quarter, up slightly from $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Bad debt expense at $1.7 million was essentially flat with the year ago. At March 31, 2018, our average interest rate in the portfolio was up 22 basis points to 3.79%. We expect this trend to continue. The balance sheet continues to be in good shape. At quarter end, our debt-to-market cap was 47%, our average debt maturity is 5.9 years, and we only have $9 million remaining in 2018 maturities.","On March 29, we closed on a $450 million, 12-year fixed rate loan on the recently expanded and renovated Broadway Plaza. The fixed interest rate is 4.18%. This is a great long-term loan with two of our strong relationship life insurance companies, MetLife and Northwestern Mutual. At the time of the financing, Broadway Plaza was not encumbered, so we took our share of the proceeds, $225 million and paid down our line of credit. In the earnings release of yesterday, we reaffirmed our estimate of diluted FFO per share guidance of $3.92 to $4.02. And as I mentioned previously, we remain comfortable with our same-center NOI growth range in 2% to 2.5%.","Looking at the leasing environment. The first quarter performance reflected good leasing volumes, whereas 2017 began with a high degree of uncertainty regarding specialty store bankruptcies, retail sales trends and department store closures. The 2018 year started on more solid footing, with good retailers sales, far fewer bankruptcies and a more balanced tone.","Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were positive 14.7%. The average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $59.12 per square foot, and that's 14% higher than the previous year. So clearly, this is a sign of strength in the leasing environment.","The average base rent in the portfolio rose to $58.44, which was a 3.8% increase over the prior year. During the quarter, a total of 614,000 square feet of leases were signed, it included Lifetime Athletic at Broadway Plaza, True Food and Shake Shack at Country Club Plaza, H&M at North Park, HomeGoods at SanTan, Johnny Was at La Ecantada,Broadway Plaza and Kierland.","During the first quarter, of 2018, the square footage of non-anchor space for tenants in our portfolio filing bankruptcy was only 112,000 square feet, and we only expect 14,000 square feet of that space to result in rejected leases. That compares to lease rejections of 154,000 square feet due to the first quarter 2017 bankruptcies, a significant improvement there.","Portfolio sales ended the quarter at $686 per square foot, a 7.4% increase on a year-over-year basis. Economic sales per foot were $800 per foot for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018, and that compared to $741 for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, and that's an 8% increase.","During the quarter, Nordstrom announced their planned relocation to Country Club Plaza in Kansas City with an opening in 2021. The addition of Nordstrom to this iconic asset advances the vision that Macerich and Taubman share to further Country Club Plaza's position as the premier center in that region.","Many of you have asked if we would replace Bob Perlmutter, so I'm going to take a moment to comment on our senior leadership group and leasing and operations. Today, as it's been for the last several years, leasing is handled and run by Executive Vice President of Leasing, Doug Healey. Doug is a very experienced and respected leasing executive with 13 years at Macerich and 14 years at Wilmorite before that. Asset management is headed today by two senior executives, Dave Short, who has 31 years of mall experience and Cory Scott, who has 10 years of experience with Macerich and nine years with three other mall companies before that.","Marketing and business development will continue to be run by Ken Volk who is the Senior Vice President. Ken has 11 years with Macerich plus 18 years with two other mall companies. Portfolio operation is led by Olivia Leigh. She is Senior Vice President and has 13 years of experience with Macerich and 13 years before that in related fields.","So you can see, we have a very talented and experienced team running leasing operations and asset management. For the past 25 years, much of the time we have operated without a COO and, in fact, that was the case before we promoted Bob Perlmutter to that position two years ago. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art.","Art Coppola","Thank you, Tom. As Tom was talking about our people, I'd like to comment on that. Look, we obviously are a real estate company and we have a terrific platform of properties. But as I think about what really makes Macerich special, it's our people, and that's really our biggest asset.","And as we think about that asset, we're certainly blessed to have a very deep bench with long tenure. A lot of these people, frankly, have never worked at other mall companies, and they've been trained by us over long periods of time and they are very well positioned to take us into the future. Certainly, two of our greatest people assets are Scott Kingsmore, who will succeed Tom O'Hern at the end of this year as our CFO. Many of you will get to know Scott and you'll find that he is extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of our business.","And our greatest people asset at this moment in time is Tom O'Hern. With this terrific team that we have here, the key question in terms of succession for me was, who is the right leader for this group of talented people. And I congratulate our Board of Directors in selecting Tom to succeed me. He is absolutely the right person to lead our team.","Looking at our business. It feels to me like we are at an inflection point in terms of the retail cycle. It feels to me that retail sentiment is definitely on the uptick. Retailers are making a lot more money because of the tax cuts, and it's hard to ignore the coincidence of that tax cut and extremely strong comp sales over the last six months. The sales trends that started in Thanksgiving through December have continued through the first quarter and they're really across the board.","As we look at our top tenants in terms of their sales performance on a comp basis in the first quarter, names like Vans that were up 47%, Hollister is up 30%, American Eagle is up 15% comp, Gucci up 52%, Restoration up 56%, Apple and Tesla up 30% and 15%, respectively, and even PacSun is up 24%.","So the sales trends are really across the board, not only with the legacy retailers, but also with the new digital retailers and new concepts that are coming to our centers. As a lot of the sell-side analysts attended Shoptalk this year. They were made \u2013 they began to see our vision that the digitally native, vertically integrated brands are going to comprise a growing share of our merchandising opportunities within our centers. They all aspired to open stores with us and they are going to be, in my view, the superstars of the next three to five years.","Another inflection point that I see is that we see stores reinvesting into their fleets. One of our top department stores by size, and I'm not referring to Nordstrom, you can probably guess who it is, has recently announced that they're going to be reinvesting in growth initiatives at their top 50 stores, of which we have a disproportionate share. As we think about the inflection point, leasing activity remain strong. Our ABRs are up significantly and we're getting new concepts in our malls.","Looking to our portfolio now and just commenting on key things that are occurring across the board. As Tom mentioned, we have \u2013 Nordstrom has announced they're coming to the Plaza in Kansas City. That's a terrific, terrific opportunity for that asset. We're wrapping up the remerchandising of Kings Plaza Sears Box with JCPenney and Primark scheduled to open roughly over the Memorial Day weekend. We have signed a new deal with Lifetime Athletics to join us at Broadway Plaza. We talked about them on the last call and they're going to be terrific. And we continue to bring new experiential retailers to our centers.","We recently opened during this past quarter Candytopia at Santa Monica Place. They're in 15,000 square feet. They opened in March. They sell \u2013 it's basically an Instagramable moment, all about candy, it's similar to the Museum of Ice Cream that some of you may have heard of. It brings people from the entire region to the center. They're selling, on average, 2,000 tickets a day at a price of $30 to come and see this exhibit. I attended over the weekend the kickoff for the new Children's Museum that's coming to Santa Monica Place, which also is going to be a terrific experiential retailer.","Other new \u2013 other key developments that I want to just touch upon. In our supplement, you'll see a new reference to Westside Pavilion. What I would note about that is that we wanted to mirror our disclosure with our partners, Hudson Pacific's disclosure. So even though it shows up in the supplement, including their acquisition price, the contributed value of the asset, when you look at the net incremental spend of $260 million, give or take, the net cash spend from our side is fairly nominal. It's $15 million to $20 million, give or take.","And we believe that they are absolutely the right partner for us there. We have significant demand for the conversion of that creative office, and we see that alliance, as I mentioned on our last call, expanding to other properties and other opportunities, particularly in gateway cities. You also would have noted in the supplement that Fashion Outlets of San Francisco dropped off of the supplement for now. That project is being completely rethought, given the delays that occurred during the entitlement by the master developer as to size, scope, timing, dollars and even the certainty of the execution on the project. So we just felt it was best to go ahead and take it off the supplement.","And one topic that I know is of great interest to all of you and then we'll open up to questions. As we talked about in our last call, our partner had \u2013 it was marketed their position in Broadway Plaza, in Walnut Creek over the past couple of months. Demand was very strong. Even though given the structure of the deal being a 50-50 deal, the sovereign wealth funds were not able to bid on it because it would have triggered a complete Prop 13 reassessment.","So it's really just the domestics. And I'm not going to put out a cap rate because, frankly, I'm not a party to the transaction, but I am an observer. And what I would guide you to is that the cap rate on forward NOI, and forward really means next year's NOI, is much, much closer to a 4% cap rate than would it be, say, a 4.5%. Some people think of the cap rate as looking a lot like the interest rate on the loan, which was 4.18%.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jim Sullivan with BTIG.","Art Coppola","Hey, Jim.","Jim Sullivan","Yes, hi. A quick question for you on Broadway Plaza. I know that, that was this included in the sales results for last year and a very robust number of 1,300 a foot. And I just want an update. I didn't think, or my understanding was that there were a couple of pieces that had not been completed there in terms of the leasing. And I wondered if you could just give us an update on leases signed or tenants pending that are going in and where that center should be going over the next six to nine months after what's been a pretty strong sales recovery in 2017 with most of the project completed.","Art Coppola","Leasing, most \u2013 every inch of the small shop space is spoken for. There will be because of some very significant investments that retailers are making in the building out their stores, those who'd be still opening up over the next 18 months. The most significant piece that isn't finished and hasn't even started construction is the addition of Lifetime Athletics to the project and that's anticipated, and my guess is to open 18 months from now, give or take, and there's significant income attached to that also.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Great, thanks. First, Art, congratulations on your impending retirement. And then, Tom, on gaining the CEO role.","Art Coppola","Thank you.","Tom O'Hern","Thanks.","Craig Schmidt","There have been a number of changes in the senior executive suite, and I just wondered if there was anything that was responsible for bringing about these events. And are there any changes that the new management wants to take with Macerich that may differ from the past path?","Art Coppola","I'll let Tom go ahead and address that.","Tom O'Hern","Well, Craig, as you saw from the various press releases, Art has been running Macerich for well over 30 years. He's put in a tremendous effort and built quite a company. So I think he's entirely entitled to retire when he chooses to. So it's understandable. I've got big shoes to fill, and I'm happy to get the opportunity.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a great team of people here, a lot of experience and I don't consider them as the bench, they're starters. They've been in the game for a long time, and you've met some of them. But they're tremendously talented and we're glad to have them, and we think we've got the talent we need to run this company.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Art Coppola","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey good morning out there. And again, I'd echo best in retirement, Art, and Tom, I guess now you get the fun of having full control. So just a question on that. One of the people you didn't talk about was the retirement of Randy on the development side. And obviously, he spoke about pulling back on Fashion Outlets. So maybe you could just give a perspective on where you guys are thinking about development, redevelopment? Certainly, Simon seems to be ramping up their redevelopment activity, and I'm just thinking about where you guys see that, and especially with Randy's retirement, who's taking over on that front?","Art Coppola","We have a very deep bench in every area of our company. Randy made that decision well over a year ago, and we've broken up that area into an East and a West. The people that are running each of the East and the West have each been with us for well close to 20 years. They've been in the business for a long, long time. And as you take a look at the actual development pipeline, we're winding down on Kings Plaza. We're going to be finishing up Philly. We've potentially taken San Francisco off the table. Westside Pavilion is going to be handled by our partner.","So we're, at the moment in time, frankly, we're really in terms of just the \u2013 some caution to also thinking about things and also thinking about allocation of capital that our development pipeline in terms of what's about to go in the ground or what is in the ground is fairly modest. The next leg up on development will be on the recycling of the Sears Boxes, and we have plans that have been developed that are very specific and are ready to go as soon as we get access to the Sears Box. We have said that we don't believe in proactively going and buying Sears out, because we believe that there'll be a day we get those back anyway. So when those boxes are ready to be densified, we're ready to go, and we're appropriately staffed.","Operator","We'll go next to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on Craig's question about the personnel changes and the Macerich platform more broadly. There has been a lot of change recently with the overhead cuts and, Art, your retirement, Bob's departure. And I know that the company has sold assets and the platform shrunk a bit, but it seems like a lot of volatility from our perspective. Should we expect to see more change or should we expect to see some level of stabilization now?","Art Coppola","I certainly empathize with you on your view around volatility. But look, this was all well thought out, well-orchestrated. It will be extremely well transitioned, and we're extremely well positioned in terms of the talent that we have on board to take us where we need to go. But I understand, and I empathize with you that it does seem a lot for you to absorb right now. It's not a lot for us to absorb because, look, we all saw this coming.","Operator","We'll go next to Christy McElroy with Citi.","Art Coppola","Hi, Christy?","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here for Christie. Yes.","Art Coppola","Hello.","Michael Bilerman","But Christie is here, too. She can say hello.","Christy McElroy","Hello.","Art Coppola","Always nice to have you both.","Michael Bilerman","Well, there you go. But we'll only ask one question, so I don't know if have to say one word and she has to say one word. I don't know how we'll do this. But...","Art Coppola","I think you can probably do whatever you want to do, Mike.","Michael Bilerman","Yes. So it tends to happen and certainly 42 years, I'm sure has felt like eight decades, instead of five decades, so congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. I was wondering if you can spend some time just talking about the corporate governance, and things that are happening. The company still hasn't filed its proxy statement. You did hit the 120-day window this week where you had to put out some of the historical proxy comp information.","Clearly, Starboard Value that's out there talking publicly about the company. We've talked about some of the management changes that have occurred. You had Fred Hubbell come off the board recently and put a new director on. Ontario Teachers had submitted in January that they're not running for reelection. Can you talk a little bit about what's holding up the proxy this year and not setting an annual date and how investors should think about that and maybe just provide some insights to what's going on from a corporate governance perspective?","Tom O'Hern","Well, actually, that was about seven questions embedded in there, but I'll take \u2013 try to take them one at a time if I can. And Art, jump in as well. In terms of governance changes, you may have noticed that we added a new director to our board in the first quarter, Peggy Alford. Peggy comes to us with experience from eBay and PayPal, both places as a CFO, and she's currently the CFO of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, very accomplished. Has a lot of experience in the digital world and a great addition to our board. She replaces Fred Hubbell who stepped off the board, so he can focus on his run for governor of Iowa.","Also, what was announced in the various press releases over the last couple of weeks is that we're decoupling the CEO and Chairman role, which should be viewed as a positive in governance circles. So those changes have happened. There may be a number of other things that we're considering that we haven't discussed or not at liberty to discuss today. And in terms of details regarding directors standing for election in the proxy, that will be included in the proxy statement, which will be filed with the SEC and available to you all within the next few weeks.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Mike Mueller","Yes, hi. And I echo the congratulations sentiment as well. In terms of guidance, you have no dispositions in there, but you sold the Philly office assets, and I think you have a couple of other assets under contract for sale as well. Are they just not meaningful or how should we be thinking about that?","Tom O'Hern","Mike, we'll probably address that at the next call and with the next guidance. We don't know whether those assets under contract will sell, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. The Philly office is a minor number. We'll also have some timing from the sell-down of our position in Westside Pavilion, but we'll address all that midyear.","Operator","We'll go next to Floris van Dijkum with Boenning.","Floris van Dijkum","Hi, good morning guys for you.","Tom O'Hern","Hi, Floris.","Floris van Dijkum","Actually, my question was actually \u2013 also related to the asset sales, but as we think about asset sales or as we should think about asset sales, are these further pruning of some of your lower quality malls? Or is this JV-ing certain assets? Or are you not at liberty to talk about that right now?","Tom O'Hern","Well, the activity so far in the year is a little bit of both. The joint venture that we entered into with Hudson Pacific is relatively unique. The other assets we're talking about are noncore assets. They're not malls, but they're noncore to us, and that's a type of asset we would continue to dispose of as the opportunity presents itself. But they're not \u2013 not any of the assets listed in our top 30 malls. These are noncore.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. Art, I was hoping you could maybe just give a little more color on your decision to step away from the board. I think most of us would understand the desire to step back from the day to day, but you've been obviously an integral part of building Macerich from the start. You're only in your mid-60s, so you're still young. You mentioned the industry being at an inflection point. So it seemed like a natural progression would be to stay on as Chairman and help shepherd in the next phase, especially just given a significant amount of time you personally spent curating a long shadow pipeline of digitally native tenants.","Art Coppola","Well, we just think it's good governance to have as many independent directors as possible and given that I will not be an employee of the company as CEO at the end of this year, I would be taking up a board seat. If the nominating committee would have nominated me, I would have been taking up a board seat, and it would have been still considered to be a non-independent board seat. We just think it's a good idea to have as many seats on the board be independent board seats as possible, and that's why that all happened.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys. Maybe in regard to similar topic. I was just curious on succession. Did the board make an effort to contact external prospects for CEO? Or maybe look to Eddie or Bobby? Or was the situation because of continuity, they went straight to Tom?","Art Coppola","Well, I'll answer that, I think \u2013 and Tom, feel free to jump in. But look, on a regular basis, we meet with the nominating and governance committee, and we talk about succession, not only for the CEO role, but for the top, probably 10 or 12 positions in the company. And certainly, as we have talked about that for the CEO role, we were blessed to have internal candidates and the nominating governance committee as well as the board, they were aware of those conversations for the past couple of years. They're also very aware of what other individuals are out there in the industry that would \u2013 that could be considered.","And as I said in my remarks, I applaud the board for picking a great leader. The key attribute to me of a CEO is being able to lead and the key asset that this company has is our people. And there is 0 question in my mind that Tom O'Hern is, by far, the most qualified person to lead our team. He's extremely \u2013 the team is extremely loyal to him. He's very loyal to them. They will follow him. And I think that the team will perform extremely well under his leadership. And so I really applaud the board. Look, I'm a big investor in this company, I have a lot at stake, and I support their decision 1,000%. Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. And congratulations, Tom and Art. Can we talk about operations for a second? Your same-store NOI basically flat, occupancy down a little bit, but with the kind of built-in escalators and the lease spread that you've been posting for past several years, I would have thought the numbers would have just been better. So there's obviously some gives \u2013 puts and takes in this number. Can you just talk about what was going in and out?","Tom O'Hern","Sure, I'd be happy to. I think the first point I'd like to make is to send you back to the transcript for the fourth quarter. I think we've talked at length about the fact that we would have tempered growth in the first half of this year as a result of filling the bankruptcies last year. It was a record year last year. And unlike a typical year, a lot of those bankruptcies came in the second half of the year. So we were optimistic about the second half of 2018 going into 2019, and that was factored into our guidance. So I thought we're fairly clear on that, but perhaps not.","And the real issue here is occupancy. The occupancy level is 94% versus 94.3% a year ago, but also the temporary occupancy has gone up to about 6.4%, that's up about 100 basis points from 5.3% a year ago. So that's lower quality occupancy, that's opportunity for us. Obviously, when you get a lot of space back, quickly, you want to fill that space even if it's with temporary tenants.","So yes, the releasing spreads are good. That typically impacts 8% to 10% of your tenants in any given year, are rolling and you're getting that pickup. Built in rent increases, get straight lined and typically they don't end up being more than, on average, 1.5% to 2% in a given year. So that versus the offset by the occupancy has kind of taken us to flat same-center NOI in the first quarter. But obviously, we feel that's going to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter or we would not have left our guidance where it is at 2% to 2.5%. The first quarter was pretty much as expected, Ki Bin.","Operator","We'll go to Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning there. I guess just similarly on the guidance, I guess on the FFO side, I know you guys mentioned last quarter that the first quarter was expected to be about 20%, but it seems like at the midpoint, you're a little above that. So I was just wondering if, indeed, you are trending stronger than you were expecting or have the quarterly splits shifted or maybe just the lack of moving FFO guidance has to do with some of the dispositions we talked about earlier and that will be assessed later in the year.","Tom O'Hern","No, I think with the splits we gave, obviously, there's some rounding in there and there's a range in there. So the first quarter ended up coming in at 21% of the annual. I think originally we said roughly 20%. Just some timing differences in there. I would still say the second quarter is probably 24% of the full year, 25% in the third quarter and the balance in the fourth quarter. And we'll reassess the assumptions in the guidance in next quarter's call as well to factor in what dispositions may or may not have happened.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning. Just a question on the same-store NOI. So you talked about sort of what happened in the first quarter being expected. But at this point, I know a lot of the leasing for the year is done already. So I guess, there is going to be some amount of commencements that need to happen to hit your back half numbers, and I was just curious how much visibility you do have on that at this point based on the leases already signed.","Tom O'Hern","Yes. We think we're going to see the acceleration in the third and fourth quarter, Vin. We've got about 65% of the bankruptcy space that we've got back has been permanently leased and will push through the balance of that, hopefully, in the second quarter and we'll see the real pickup in the third and fourth quarter this year, which we feel pretty good about.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys. Just a question about maybe the financing side of the equation. One of the things that we focused on given the move up in LIBOR is maybe some of your floating rate debt. I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Are you, Tom, thinking about \u2013 trying to term some of that? Or are you comfortable with the amount of floating rate debt at this point?","Tom O'Hern","Yes. Rich, we've got about, I think, 16% or 17% of our debt is floating rate debt, the bulk of that is on our line of credit. We have one small loan that's floating that comes up later this year that we may fix out. But when we gave our guidance this year, we based it on the forward LIBOR curve. I think our preference is always to go long-term fixed rate financing, even Broadway Plaza, which was in the rising interest rate environment, we've got a fairly effective coupon on that, and we saw the spread compresses as rates went up. So we've got a little bit of benefit there.","So it's always our preference. I don't see a big change for us this year because we don't have a lot of maturities coming due. But it's always our preference when any of the floating rate debt does come due to put in fixed rate. So we keep an eye on it, but I think we're comfortable with the level of floating rate debt we have right now.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Art Coppola with closing or additional remarks.","Art Coppola","Right. Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you and meeting with you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"13965":["Macerich Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jean Wood","Thank you, everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. During the course of this call, management may make certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.","We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the Company's website at www.macerich.com.","Joining us today are Art Coppola, CEO and Chairman; Tom O\u2019Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Perlmutter, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thank you, Jean. The fourth quarter reflected continued solid operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our key operating metrics. FFO for the quarter was $1.03 that includes the adverse impact of about $0.10 a share due to revaluing our deferred tax assets as a result of the new lower corporate income tax rates that were passed by Congress at year end. Our guidance in the Street estimates did not factor in that tax rate impact. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax asset, FFO for the quarter was $1.13 and $3.93 for the year.","Same center NOI growth excluding straight-line rents and SFAS 141 income was up 2.4% for the quarter. Year-to-date, the same center growth rate was 2.7%. The major reasons for the actual being lower than our guidance range in the fourth quarter was largely due to temporary tenant income being less than forecast, other income including advertising being less than forecast, and the results from the Tysons mixed use buildings being less than forecast.","Lease termination fees for the quarter were $7.6 million compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter last year. However, for the full-year lease terminations were relatively flat at $22 million compared to $21 million in 2016. Bad debt expense was relatively modest $900,000 for the quarter down from $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","During the fourth quarter, the average interest rate was up about 20 basis points to 3.71% at year-end. The balance sheet continues to be in good shape. At quarter end, our balance sheet metrics were debt to market cap 44%, interest coverage ratio 3.3 times, very healthy and average debt maturity of 5.9 years which we expect to improve as we closed on the financing of Broadway Plaza which I will talk about shortly.","In December, we closed on the refinancing of Santa Monica Place. We put a new five-year floating rate loan of $300 million in place of the former $215 million loan, the initial interest rate is 3.13%. Along with our partner, we closed on a $250 million five-year floating rate loan on the Fashion District Philadelphia. That loan has an initial interest rate of 3.56%. And we have also arranged a $450 million 12-year fixed rate loan on the recently expanded and renovated Broadway Plaza. The loan is expected to close in February and the rate has been locked at 4.18%.","There was no activity in our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. In last night's earnings release, we gave guidance for 2018 in the range of $3.92 to $4.02. Some of the major assumptions include same center NOI of 2% to 2.5%, lease terminations are estimated at $22 million comparable to 2017 and 2016 actuals. There are no 2018acquisitions or dispositions reflecting in the guidance.","The average LIBOR rate is assumed to be up 80 basis points compared to 2017 on our floating rate debt of approximately $1.4 billion and we\u2019ve assumed no share buybacks. We have sold 24 non-core assets, lower producing properties in the past few years and have significantly reduced our portfolio size.","Accordingly, we have reduced our property-based staff subsequent to the dispositions and in the first quarter of 2018, we are downsizing our corporate staff and making some significant overhead cuts. Those cuts will take place in the first quarter and will yield annual cost savings of approximately $17 million.","The 2018 income statement benefit from the cuts is approximately $10 million, which will occur in the second, third, and fourth quarter and there will be a severance expense in the first quarter of 2018 of $12 million. That severance costs will impact the quarterly split of FFO, which we expect to be for the year 20% in the first quarter, 24% in the second quarter, 25% in the third quarter and the balance in the fourth quarter.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the retail environment.","Robert Perlmutter","Thanks, Tom. Fourth quarter performance generated improved leasing levels with the centers and solid leasing spreads. 2017 began with a high degree of uncertainty, regarding specialty store bankruptcies, retail sales trends and department store closures. The year ended on more solid floating with an above average holiday season resolution of a number of specialty store bankruptcies and a more balanced owned from the retailer community.","Let me start with the leasing statistics. Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 15.2%. This is up slightly from the previous quarter. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $59.20 per square foot. This is 4.6% higher than the previous year.","Average base rent within the portfolio is $56.97 per square foot. This represents a 3.8% increase over the prior year. During the fourth quarter, a total of $1.3 million square feet of leases were signed, bringing the total activity during the year to $3.3 million square feet.","During the fourth quarter, new leases totaling over 400,000 square feet were signed with tenants greater than 10,000 square feet. This included Life Time Athletic at Biltmore, Bristol Farms and La Cumbre, the Zimmer Children's Museum By ShareWell at Santa Monica Place, Nordstrom Rack at SanTan, two Burlington stores at Kings Plaza and Lakewood as well as three new locations with H&M.","The average term for the lease is under 10,000 square feet signed in the fourth quarter was five years. This is compared to the Q3 average of 5.4 years. Leasing levels at the end of the year increased to 95%. This represented a 40 basis point decrease on a year-over-year basis and a 70 basis point increase from the third quarter.","Portfolio sales ended the fourth quarter at $660 per square foot, a 4.8% increase on a year-over-year basis. On the same center basis, trailing 12-month sales were up 3.5%. Bankruptcies in 2017, totaled 850,000 square feet, including 160,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. This was an increase from the previous year level of 500,000 square feet.","We've discussed before, these bankruptcies often present an opportunity to replace lower volume retailers with stronger more productive stores. However, these bankruptcies will impact 2018 income as the space is released. The holiday season for retailers was the strongest in a number of years.","According to the U.S. Census Bureau, sales during the November and December period totaled $690 billion, a 5.5% increase over the previous year. Of this amount 85% of the sales were conducted in physical stores. ICSC research indicated that shoppers spent an average of $842 on gifts and holiday related items. This is an 18% increase over the previous year.","Finally, 90% of the click-and-collect shoppers made an additional store purchase highlighting the relationship of the online and in-store businesses. There have been numerous articles written on the recent passage of tax reform and the positive impact for retailers.","According to the University of Pennsylvania, retailers stand to benefit by an estimated $171 billion over the next 10 years as their corporate tax rate is significantly reduced. The outcome from tax reform at year-end stands in stark contrast to the beginning of 2017 when the fear of a border tax weighed on retailers.","Last Friday, Nordstrom announced their planned relocation to Country Club Plaza in Kansas City opening in 2021. The addition of Nordstrom to this iconic asset advances the vision that Macerich and Taubman share to expand Country Club\u2019s positive position as the premier center in the region.","In conclusion, the combination of a strong holiday season, tax reform law and retailer\u2019s corporate tax burden, and tax relief for individuals has provided support for a solid beginning to 2018. Retailer sentiment seems to be improving, while bankruptcies and early terminations will continue to provide headwinds in 2018 and temper growth it appears that much of this is working its way through the system.","With that, I'll turn it over to Art.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks Bob. Thanks Tom. I just want to review the annual results for 2017 a little bit, some of the basic metrics and look to the outlook also. For the calendar year 2017, by any measure we had a very solid year. Tenant sales are up from $630 a foot to $660. We had another great year of releasing spreads at just over 15%. We raised our average base rent in our portfolio by 3.8% and same center NOI was up just over 2.5% for the year in spite of the fact that we got hit by unexpected store closures of an unprecedented amount over recent memory.","On our balance sheet, we continue to extend our maturity schedule even though by converting short-term floating rate debt to long-term fixed rate debt. Obviously that has an impact on our FFO for 2018, but extending our maturity schedule and taking interest rate volatility out of the mix for us is just the right thing to do in this environment.","During 2017, we continue to walk our talk on the dispositions. We sold two sub-performing retail assets for over $170 million. We sold $150 million of non-core office properties and another $18 million of other assets for a total of just over $338 million, and we reinvested that money well.","As Bobby pointed out, we made good progress during the year in terms of improving the anchor integrity of our centers whether it would be the announcement that Nordstrom is coming to Country Club Plaza or the recycling of the Sears store at Kings Plaza, which we are very excited to be able to showcase for you in April, May of this year as the new anchor tenants that are going to occupy that store take place.","We are very excited about adding Life Time Athletics through Biltmore and we expect to announce another Life Time Athletic deal with one of our premier centers in the very near future. On the point of item athletics, I would point out that this is not another gym and this is not another health club and it's not another fitness center. This is a holistic wellness facility that draws tremendous amounts of traffic for us at exactly the right hours of the day and the right demographic.","Typical well performing Life Time Athletic in our portfolio, the average household income of the members are at levels that would be comparable to the average household incomes of major retailers like Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus.","We anticipate that at a strong facility, which each of these will be that they'll draw at least 200,000 visitors per year to our properties and at times of the day that don't conflict with the parking needs of other retailers. So we are very excited about that. Our outlook for 2018, I would say at this point as you can tell from our guidance is cautiously optimistic. I am much more positive as I look into 2019 and 2020.","The reason I am cautiously optimistic for 2018 is that when you get hit with unexpected bankruptcies like we did in 2017, and you do business in high barrier-to-entry cities, many of which are hard to get entitlements in even for the tenants that are replacing existing tenants and you own assets where the rents are extremely high, so you are talking major commitments.","You don't go ahead and just turn on the switch and replace that vacancy overnight. It takes six to 24 months; especially when someone is thoughtful about curating a tenant mix with the replacement tenants that will complement the balance of the center.","As Bobby said, the retailer mood is definitely better at this point in time. You all read the reviews that ICR, the outcome from that conference in January and the fact that retailers \u2013 or the legacy retailers and I would point out that the retailers that attend that conference are generally public company retailers and that's not the entire retail universe, that's just the public company retail universe, but their mood is generally better. The mood of the retailers moving away from the public companies is much brighter than you hear from the public company.","As you look at the private companies and I am particularly talking about digitally native, vertically integrated brands. This is the fastest growing digital commerce channel that exists. From 2016 to 2020 it's estimated that digitally native, vertically integrated brands market share of all of digital commerce will grow from 12% to about 22%. That's much faster growth than any other category or any other individual company.","And the good news about these retailers is that they all want stores. They're in the top of the first inning, most of them, in terms of putting their toe into the water, but at the end of the day they totally understand that it's a balance of digital and offline that makes for a great retailer.","As I look forward into the next two or three years, the big question is where is the demand going to come from to make these centers more vibrant? And the answer is that we see demand coming from the number of source. The legacy retailers are in a better mood. They are fueled by the Tax Cuts that are going to fund expansions for them. Several of the legacy retailers are working on new digital and offline integrated concepts, which hopefully will be exciting.","As I\u2019ve talked about a few minutes ago, the digitally native, vertically integrated brands are going to be a big source of growth not this year, but as you look at it, it's going to grow year by year by year and each year it's going to grow over the previous year. In our portfolio, we see integrating complementary uses like the Children's Museum at Santa Monica Place to the center. The Children's Museum currently draws over 250,000 visitors per year and they anticipate that they'll draw significantly more than that in Santa Monica.","And I would note, the Los Angeles is evidently the most under-served Children's Museum market of any major city. There isn't another Children's Museum within a one-hour drive of Santa Monica. So we think it's going to be a great complementary draw to the center.","We think that co-working is going to find a place in our centers, and in fact, we just signed a deal today with a co-working operator to take 35,000 feet of our centers at Scottsdale Fashion Square with an entertainment retail, a lot of the VR concepts and AR concepts are going to find their way into our centers and make them even more exciting as well as experiential retail. So I'm cautiously optimistic about 2018. I'm proud of 2017, and I'm significantly more optimistic as I look to 2019 and 2020.","With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take your first question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Good afternoon, guys.","Arthur Coppola","Hello, Jeff.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Hello. Actually just I guess question for Tom, and you talked about some of the overhead cuts that you guys are going to be making. Are you able to talk about maybe looking forward after those cuts are implemented and adjusting for the asset sales? How we should think about the NOI margin of the company and sort of a \u2013 I\u2019ll call it, post sales, post cuts basis versus where it was prior to those sales in those cuts? I'm just curious if this ends up enhancing margins of the company?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well it has, Jeff, you've seen the margins improved fairly significantly over the past few years at the property level. So as we've made dispositions at the property level, we've reduced our overhead and our headcount and we've actually improved our margin by about 400 basis points from 2014. This will be primarily an improvement to the EBITDA margin and as a result of these reductions. We should see an improvement of EBITDA margins by about 120 basis points to 130 basis points. And that will show up gradually through 2018 and it will be there in its entirety in 2019.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","We'll hear next from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning.","Arthur Coppola","Good morning, Floris.","Floris van Dijkum","Hi, good morning, Art. I had a two part question, I guess number one, I guess one of the key things that investors are concerned about obviously is \u2013 one is the right value for the mall space and the mall companies and A malls in particular. And I guess number one, is there \u2013 can you give any more updates on what is happening with Broadway Plaza and stake of your partner there and I guess related to that is, would you share with investors what your range of your NAV is or what are the things that prevent you as I believe you shared these with your board every quarter. What's preventing you from sharing that with the investors?","Arthur Coppola","Sure, I'm happy to answer the first part and I'm not going to answer the second part. The first part is that our partner has hired an investment banker to market their position. It's a great property and they've just set the teasers out to a number of institutional investors. And we anticipate strong interest and as \u2013 my guess is it will probably because of the size of the asset. Its probably be six months or so before they would likely circle something here, but you'll have a print if you will on that one.","As far as the value of an A mall portfolio, I have an opinion, but I'm not going to share it now because that would be inappropriate, but there's 20 of proxy out there for folks to look at. I mean people are looking for a print and then you have that major transaction between Unify and Westfield and it's didn't happen and you all can do your own map. So I hope that answers your question and that's the best I can do in terms of answering it for you.","Floris van Dijkum","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hi, Craig.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks. I guess I wanted to touch a little bit more on finding new opportunities for the digitally native, vertically integrated bands. What are they looking for in terms of the lease? Are they looking into more of the trial basis? What are you doing to open yourself to those tenants and how might that impact some of the results as you work towards those new retailers.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","I think that\u2019s Adam questions Craig.","Craig Schmidt","I'm sorry maybe just an overview of\u2026","Arthur Coppola","I\u2019ve getting with you sorry. Look, the answer is, there was no one answer and if there was any one answer then that would get in the way of my doing business with them. These brands kind of makes them a common characteristics are that they\u2019re digitally native. Okay, they were born in these online worlds, not the offline world.","They're vertically integrated that meaning to say, totally understand their entire supply chain and they're selling their own goods. They're not reselling other people's stuff. That's a huge point selling their own brand. They've created a brand that's important and that brand has a place within the sector that they are and whether it be apparel shoes or home or beauty. And that brand resonates with their customers that they've acquired through their digital channels.","But the other thing that is all \u2013 and they all want to have stores. Having stores is not an appendage, it is the core to their strategy. At the end of the day, the offline stores are a much lower cost of acquisition of new customers for the digital related brands and have a much higher long-term value per customer and a much higher conversion rate.","So these brands are born digitally and now they want to go offline. But as they go offline and they open stores, this is where their expertise doesn't exist and this is where we have to help them as landlords. And so we are helping them in a number of different ways. We're helping them with a much more flexible lease or helping them in terms of sometimes actually walking them through the process of finding contractors getting the stores build, getting things entitled. We are definitely doing creative leases with them.","There's a place for that in our portfolio, but at the end of the day while the creative part of the lease might exist in the short-term for a year or so ultimately once it proves out for each of us, it becomes a much more conventional lease. So there's no real rule and if the word rule it would get in the way of how we do business. The only rule is, this is new to them, it's new to us and we're helping them to bridge the gap.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to the next caller in the queue Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys. You talked about some of the retailer moods improving post reform. Question for Bob, can you just talk about what this is mean for your outlook for closing and bankruptcies relative to maybe where you were last call? And then do you get a sense that part of this better mood is [indiscernible] to an increased focus on reinvesting in their physical stores here?","Robert Perlmutter","So a couple of comments. As I mentioned before our bankruptcies in 2017 was 850,000 that compares with 500,000 in the previous year. So we definitely saw an uptick. The fourth quarter was actually a little heavier than we had anticipated at 160,000. I think on the positive signs, you saw at the beginning of 2017 many of the bankruptcies resulting in liquidation, and as we work through the year, the majority of them want the restructuring as opposed to liquidating. So that's a sign of some strength. We think looking at 2018, the bankruptcies are still going to be there.","We don't believe they're going to be as high as they were in 2017. We really just see \u2013 when we look at the list, we are working through some of the major ones and it doesn't mean they're not out there. In terms of where that tax savings goes whether it goes into stores or whether it goes into online or it goes to their employees or goes to their shareholders, I guess every company is going to make their own decision.","We do believe that the brick-and-mortar store needs more attention from these retailers. It's a very profitable means and as evidenced with many of the digital brands, it is part of their growth trajectory to have these physical stores. So we don't see it is an either or we see them being complementary. We see the retailers starting to understand the relationships better and use them more effectively for multiple venues. ","Jeremy Metz","Thanks guys.","Operator","We will hear next from Nick Yulico from UBS.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks. I guess just going back to \u2013 Art, you talked about being cautiously optimistic for this year. And how should we square that with the lease term fees and guidance being similar this year versus last year. And I know you don't get into specific occupancy guidance, but kind of feel like you're implying that bankruptcies are not as high this year and you finally gets through some of the releasing of space that should we assume that you could have a little bit better occupancy benefit this year?","Arthur Coppola","I believe that we could have some occupancy benefit this year, but I feel much more positive about on a relative basis occupancy gains in 2019. Look we're working very hard, it's job one. Everybody in this Company is in the leasing business today and that starts with me. As far as lease term fees, those are frankly \u2013 they don't come under my radar screen. One way or another, they are what they are, there's a long-term history there, and while they're non-recurring they seem to recur in a non-recurring in consistent manner. So that's my view.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi, good morning.","Arthur Coppola","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, Art. Just a question for you. You're going to have a chance to bring a board member on. At the coming election, one of your board members have decided to step down or not run for reelection. As you guys look at the business, I mean you talked a lot about digital retailers and how the industry is changing. As you see the Company going forward is there anything in particular that you're looking for in a quality perspective of a new board member as you look at running the Company forward?","Arthur Coppola","Yes. We definitely have a profile of what the board is looking for and what the nominating governance committee is going to be looking for. We have a number of candidates that are regularly in our queue. And the board will \u2013 and the nominating governance committee will be evaluating this over the near-term. And we have a great board. Our two most recent additions John Alschuler and Steve Hash have been terrific on the board. And we have every reason to believe that it's a very attractive board for people to join that we're going to be able to attract high quality candidates.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank has your next question.","Vincent Chao","Hey, everyone. Tom, just want to go back to your comments about some the ins and outs of the same-store NOI in the fourth quarter. You mentioned a number of things and then Bobby just mentioned the bankruptcies in the fourth quarter being a little bit higher than expected. Can you just maybe quantify what that 160,000 really good to the numbers? And maybe on the lease terminations fee which I thought maybe had something to do with it, I mean that was higher than expected I think for the full-year. Can you just maybe give some color around what drove that heightened amount of terminations and maybe how that impacted either occupancy or same-store NOI in the quarter?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well I\u2019ll let Bob comment the second, but in terms of his negotiating for the lease term fees, but we did have a bit more than we expected, of course, that causes vacancy which adversely affected the quarter. So in one case it helped, in one case it hurt and close to offsetting is my estimate on those. The other things I mentioned were things that we typically see as relatively strong in the fourth quarter and did not meet our forecast which was based roughly on last year's actual and that included advertising revenue was off, temporary tenant income was also off this year compared to forecast and last year. And also we had less rent from the Tysons mixed use assets primarily the office building and the apartments which had mostly timing differences on lease up that was slower than expected.","Robert Perlmutter","In terms of the terminations there were probably two larger terminations. One has received a lot of publicity, but basically these were brands that were owned by parents with significant resources which resulted in two larger settlements in the fourth quarter. In terms of the fourth quarter bankruptcies, it probably didn't impact the numbers in a huge way, it's probably more of a 2018 issue than it is in fourth quarter 2017 because of the timing of when they happened.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Arthur Coppola","Good morning, Todd.","Todd Thomas","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Art, I wanted to ask about a series of events that happened recently that I was hoping you could shed some light on. Bloomberg reported on January 22 that your largest shareholder Ontario Teachers was contemplating a privatization and two days later research note was published, indicating that you commented no activity there and then Macerich filed an 8-K the following day saying the same, and less than a week later the sole board member representing Ontario Teachers indicate that he will not stand for re-election the upcoming annual shareholder meeting. Can you just provide some context on the sequence of events, and following up on the board seat opening, is there an intention by Ontario Teachers to maintain board representation?","Arthur Coppola","Well, first of all as to your last question, they don't have any inherent right to a board seat, so that's not relevant. Look as far as the rumors that hit the papers in the press, we made our comments about our view on the rumors. Those comments speak for themselves.","As far as John Sullivan\u2019s decision to not run for reelection, John was a very valuable board member for us and his decision to not run for re-election was not as a result of any disagreement between John and the company. The news is what the news is and we stand by what we put out in the way of public you know positions in the 8-K that we filed and that's really all I had to say about that. Thank you, next.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Linda Tsai from Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Hi, how you thinking about the quarterly cadence of SSNOI in 2018? Should we assume that occupancies can be weighed down some of the closures in the first half? So SSNOI should be strong in the second half or maybe just in more color how you are thinking about the trend?","Arthur Coppola","I'm going to jump in and preempt your answer, Tom. I know you're going to try and answer that question. I'm going to encourage you not to answer that question because there are too many things that happen every day and every week and we don't control them. We give our best for you for the year and then we try and give you guidance by quarter, Tom, you're free to go ahead and answer the question. But I'll tell you the way, I think about it \u2013 I think about it on an annual basis because to think about it on a quarterly basis, there are just too many things that can be read into it.","The wrong way one way or the other, one quarter versus the other that's my view and that's from with looking at things 360 and I think it's the right way to look at it I really do I understand the need for everybody to want to look at things quarterly, but at every numbers that's out there. The one that I would highly encourage you to move away from focusing on a quarterly basis, as an entire sell side and investor world, get away from at our quarterly same center NOI, but that's up to you and you can answer the question Tom.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","I don't think it would be terribly prudent of me to answer. Given that preamble, I will give you the quarterly split on FFO though Linda. It's because of the severance in the first quarter is going to be low 20% on FFO and then the middle of the year is 24% in the second quarter, 25% in the third and then in the fourth quarter because we do have some seasonality to our business at our revenues that's the balance for the year. Thank you.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Could you comment on the pace of early lease renegotiations, I have it gotten better or how does that compare to 2017?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Ki Bin, I\u2019ll try to take this. As I mentioned our sense is that the legacy retailers, the retailers with the larger fleets are feeling a little bit more comfortable with their business and that's reflecting in the renewals. It's not always reflecting in economics that we would like, but it is bringing more consistency.","So it does seem like there's more predictability to how we're dealing with the tenants. The mandates to close stores seem to be moving a little bit towards working together to try to keep stores open and talk about new plans. So I wouldn't say it's robust by any means, but it does seem to be improving on the renewals.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, and is that the renewals of activity or occupancy blips that caused the decrease and SFAS 141 rental income?","Arthur Coppola","The decrease in 141 was primarily due to a Macy's building that we purchased and therefore it eliminated and so you reverse out the 141 asset on the books that was the main reason I went down and a non-recurring item.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. I guess just a couple questions are around kind of some of the new uses, and you talked about the museum at Santa Monica Place, you talked about this co-working deal for Scottsdale. I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk about the returns on those deals and how those compare to some of the other returns, which are looking at. And then is there any comments you could provide on the sale of Westside Pavillion and the kind of process that's going on there?","Arthur Coppola","Sure. The museum, it's a legitimate question. I'm actually glad that you asked it because some people might say well what happened, did you given the space. This was space that was on the third level, the Santa Monica Place is about 25,000 feet. And we actually were going to put a co-working operation into it and we expected that we would be able to generate net rents from that cold co-working space of something within $10 of our average ADR that we have in our portfolio, which is actually pretty good for the third level of that particular property.","And the museum approached us. We talked to them. And we decided \u2013 and they actually offered a comparable rent to us, and we just decided, look the co-working would have been interesting, it would have been profitable and would have brought nice traffic and some dizziness up there on the third level, but it wouldn't have brought 300,000 visitors moms with kids and an interactive experiential experience.","This is \u2013 the word museum actually does a disservice. This is a totally interactive experiential operation. They've got classes. They've got public programs in the arts, music movement, cross cultural exchange, early childhood education. It's completely interactive. So I'm really bullish on that.","The co-working opportunities that we're doing, it's not the 50-yard line on the first level of a mall. And these work in urban locations where you have the profile of the type of worker that likes to use a co-working space and I'm very bullish on those. We're again seeing average ADRs in our early analysis of this that are within the zip code of the average ADRs in our portfolio and above the type of rent that we would get from a pure retail idea.","So I think that there are \u2013 look each of these have to stand the rigor of a financial return, but if you can get a good financial return and have a complementary use that drives traffic and brings a new customer to a property then in this world it\u2019s a great thing to do. And there is going to be just more and more and more of this in our portfolio. Our portfolio is essentially being town squares. It's whatever wants to be in the center of a town or a city is what's going to be there.","The Director of the Children's Museum, I met with her the other day and she said I don\u2019t have half a dozen Children\u2019s Museums around the country to contact me and say how did you get into that shopping center because we think it's brilliant to put Children\u2019s Museums and shopping centers for all these reasons.","So on the experiential and the entertainment side of retail, there's just no shortage of companies that are developing experience a lot of ideas, and they're very exciting, and think Dave & Busters today and Chuck E. Cheese of yesterday, put them on steroids and doesn't quite approach Disneyland, but it's pretty darn interesting and they are coming.","And look don't have to stand the test, the financial discipline test on any other space, but the good news about them is, look it's a complimentary use, it's a different use, and they're all traffic generators. And they were bringing the good traffic and the right traffic just as I was talking about with Life Time Athletics. That brings a perfect customer to us. So it's the type of thing in this new era of the town square that you're going to see more and more of them coming to these properties. And I think they\u2019re going to be great. So you gave one question and I gave you four answers. Thank you. Next.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Christy McElroy from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here for Christy. Art, your relationship with Ontario Teachers and Cadillac goes back over two decades now. So it's been a very close relationship between the two firms. And I remember a few years ago when you did the deal in November 14 and swapping the assets for stock it was the opportunity for them to move from an asset level to an enterprise level. And you invited John onto the board at that time at 11% stake which is now built up to almost 17% as your largest shareholder.","Can you at least share with us the rationale and the reason and I recognize you said there's no disagreement, but can you at least share with us some of the rationale behind him stepping off what he provided you because arguably you do have a very close relationship between the two organizations that goes back a very long time and it's really rare to see in our shareholder relinquish the opportunity to sit on a board and effectively manage what is a multi-billion dollar position?","Arthur Coppola","Well let me first of all say, yes, I have enjoyed a very good relationship with Cadillac Fairview and Ontario Teachers now for 21 years. It's a very important relationship. John is the CEO of Cadillac Fairview. And Cadillac Fairview and Macerich continue to share best \u2013 the largest operator and the highest quality operator in Canada. We continue to share best practices back in forth literally every week and that's ongoing. So the relationship between the two companies, Cadillac which is by Ontario and Macerich is extremely good. As to the reason that he decided not to stand for re-election, I cannot speak for him and he did not give me a specific reason.","Michael Bilerman","And the intention is to replace him with any independent or\u2026?","Arthur Coppola","Yes, definitely. Yes, absolutely. We have a number of really good candidates that we're focused on. And look, we'll miss John as a Director, but not being a Director doesn't preclude him from having a very close pulse on how the operations at Macerich\u2019s are doing, and again, we share best practices back in forth everyday with their marketing teams, their leasing teams, we sent tenants north, they sent tenants south and that hasn't stopped and that will continue.","Michael Bilerman","And his voting agreement with the shares does that \u2013 I can't remember what the agreement was since he have to vote in line with the board's recommendation for everything above the 10.9% stake?","Arthur Coppola","That's a matter of public record. Tom if you \u2013 I don't recall all of that off the top of my head.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","I think it's just in excess of 15%.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","It's a matter of public record. So I get checked the public record and we will get back to you on that. It's a matter of public record. Let's answer the question that way.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thanks Mike.","Operator","We'll hear next from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo Okusanya","Hi, yes, good afternoon. My question is mainly focused around capital structure. Just trying to understand why there were no buybacks in 4Q and why no new plan in 2018 given the big discount to NAV, and as worldwide this isn\u2019t released by your paper to fund recently when any of your leases generally a much longer that that?","Arthur Coppola","I answered that question on our last call that we really saw share buybacks is dropping down our priority list given the other opportunities that we've had in our portfolio, and if anything I would say that it's probably dropped even a little bit more. It has absolutely nothing to do with the perception of value because it's a great \u2013 in our view, it's a great buy.","But look I think in the uncertain times that we live in retaining capital from dispositions or other activities and reserving them for redeployment into the densification of our properties in the redevelopment of our properties is a more value creating activity for us than anything else that we can do. So I don't see share buybacks in the 2018 timeframe and I signal that strongly in the last call.","Omotayo Okusanya","Gotcha, and then the use a five year paper to funded longer duration leases?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Well, that was kind of a unique situation. Most of our financing has been long-term effects like Broadway Plaza for example, 12 years, but in the case of Santa Monica Place, there's a lot of moving pieces there still and we didn't want to finance that long today and find ourselves in a couple years being very under leverage on that particular asset.","Just as example are talked about the Children's Museum is going in on the third level there's a few other changes and so that was a relatively rare situation where we decided to go with short-term financing on than long-term. In the case of Philadelphia that's a construction project and that essentially is a pre-funded construction loan, which typically we do go short-term on those.","Arthur Coppola","On the other hand Broadway has a much longer term.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Broadway is a 12-year loan.","Arthur Coppola","Santa Monica that was \u2013 look the landlords would have loved to have gone long, and normally I would have done that, but you really need to measure where you are in the cycle and we saw so much near-term upside in the NOI at Santa Monica over the next three years that we just felt it was silly to tie it up for 10 years will be more.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, great.","Arthur Coppola","And we\u2019re trying to ladder our maturity schedules also that's part of the two.","Omotayo Okusanya","Gotcha. And then just my second question same-store NOI just going back to that, again trying to understand the slowdown in 2018 versus 2017 if you guys did feeling really comfortable about where occupancy could end up in 2018, kind of just one of the many other factors that are resulting in slight slowdown in 2018 versus 2017?","Arthur Coppola","Like you said, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about 2018 for all the reasons that we've talked about today. Look if this was late I would say we're in choppy waters from an incident that happened in 2017, which was a tremendous amount of store closures. It takes six to 24 months to intelligently re-curate and re-merchandise these spaces and great centers like we know. And I'm cautiously optimistic so we'll see.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Arthur Coppola","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call and question. Just want to get quickly back into the numbers for a second. It looks like over the rents declined around 10% year-over-year in 4Q, I was hoping maybe you could just spend a little bit of time helping us reconcile that with some of the commentary that we've heard that that sales were \u2013 there I say robust in 4Q 2017?","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Yes, Rich. I\u2019ll take part of that. I\u2019ll let Bob answer part of that as well. The percentage rents we get from \u2013 in a very few tenants percentage wise. We must prefer to have big base rent and percentage rent is just not terribly relevant or significant percentage of our total rents. If you look at total rents for the year at $993 million percentage rents for the year is only $17 million.","So it's relatively in significant, very few tenants are actually in percentage rent and what we hope is as leases expire and we're able to renew those leases at higher rents, the tenant will move out of being in a percentage rent paying position and into a position of paying significant base rent.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes, Rich, the only thing I would add to that is as Tom said a lot of times, these are the more productive specialty stores within the shopping center and either they wind up wanting to expand and upgrade their presentation early in which case we try to roll the percentage right into their new base rent or at renewal we try the same thing. So part of it going down probably reflects either the renewal at expiration or early expansions of some productive tenants that are generating the percentage rent.","Richard Hill","Got it. Thanks for the color. I'll stop there.","Arthur Coppola","Okay. I think we'll get time for one more.","Operator","Your last question will come from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Hi.","Thomas O\u2019Hern","Hey, Mike.","Michael Mueller","Tom, your comments about temp tenant and ad leasing being down or ad revenues being down on the fourth quarter, can you put some color on that? Was it a function of just having a pretty high bogie that you just didn't get or was it more of a case where the normal course of business just didn't materialize this year?","Arthur Coppola","Well in the case of advertising revenue for example that was based on prior year, and I'm sure Bob and Art have an opinion on this, but we base that on history and maybe there is a little shift, maybe people are moving more to handheld devices rather than the billboards and signage.","Robert Perlmutter","Yes. I think the media business is a business that sort of happens fairly quickly. And a couple of things fell out at the end of the year that we had hoped to get in and unfortunately some of those deals can make a reasonable impact. So it's not a long lead item. It's something that's presented fairly quickly and decisions are made very quickly, but it's also not as predictable as a 10-year lease in terms of receiving revenue.","Michael Mueller","Got it. And what about the temp tenants?","Robert Perlmutter","Temp tenants, again, I don't know that I can offer any color. Clearly that is something in our budget that we pushed to try to maximize knowing that we were going to have vacancies during the year and it did not hit the budget side. And I know that I can add any color to that.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Arthur Coppola","All right. Thank you, all. We appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to communicating with you in the weeks and months to come. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."]}}
