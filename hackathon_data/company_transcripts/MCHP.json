As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operation.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales in the March quarter were a record $430.1 million and were up 3.4% sequentially from net sales of $416 million in the immediately preceding quarter.","Revenue by product line was $275.8 million for microcontrollers, $97.2 million for analog, $32.8 million for memory, $22.1 million for licensing and $2.3 million of other.","Revenue by geography was $84.7 million in the Americas, $99.3 million in Europe and $246.1 million in Asia.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.4% from the March quarter and above the high end of our guidance provided on February 7 of 56.25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.6% of sales and well below the low end of our guidance of 29.25%. Non-GAAP operating income was 27.8% of sales, and net income was $109.3 million.","This resulted in earnings of $0.52 per diluted share, which was $0.05 above the mid-point of our guidance and $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. Our EPS guidance and the actual results included about $0.03 from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","For fiscal 2013, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were $1.606 billion and up 16.1% year-over-year. Gross margins were 57.2%, operating expenses were 28.6% of sales and operating income was 28.6% of sales. Net income was $388.5 million or $1.89 per diluted share.","On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 55.6% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins were impacted by the sell-through of $1.1 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisition and $2.5 million of share-based compensation.","Total operating expenses were $182.3 million or 42.4% of sales, and include intangible amortization and special charges totaling $47.1 million and also includes share-based compensation of $10.9 million. The GAAP net income was $59.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share.","For fiscal 2013, on a full GAAP basis, net sales were $1.582 billion. Gross margins were 53%. Operating expenses were 41.7% of sales, and operating income was 11.3% of sales. Net income was $127.4 million or $0.62 per diluted share.","In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 4.5% and was favorably impacted by $6.5 million from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit relating to calendar year 2012. The GAAP tax expense was impacted by the acquisition-related items and several nonrecurring events. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items. Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.22, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.046 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006.","The dividend declared today of $0.3535 per share will be paid on June 4, 2013, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $69.6 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 43rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 37th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And when the dividend is paid, it will take our cumulative dividends paid to our shareholders to over $2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2013, came down significantly to $242.3 million or 116 days. Our internally produced inventory is still a bit high, and our inventory purchased from foundries is low. We will continue to work on rightsizing the various components of our inventory holdings. We expect days of inventory at the end of the June quarter to be flat to up modestly, although we expect our internally produced inventory to decline again. Inventory at our distributors increased by 3 days during the March quarter from the record low levels we saw in the December quarter and are now at 30 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At March 31, the consolidated accounts receivable balance increased to $230 million, driven by the back-end weighted shipments in the quarter associated with the Chinese New Year and the inventory build at our distributors. Receivable balance are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.","We had strong free cash flow generation in the March quarter of $123.3 million prior to our dividend payment. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.84 billion, and we had $620 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the June quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $15.5 million for the March quarter and $51.6 million for fiscal 2013. The capital spending in Q4 was about $8.5 million below our forecast for the quarter, with these capital receipts pushing into Q1 of fiscal '14. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter, impacted by the rollover of capital from the March quarter, as well as $12.5 million and a building purchase in India to support our growing R&D operations in that location. We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be about $80 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $22.4 million and was $88.4 million for fiscal 2013.","I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines in the March quarter, starting with microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller revenue grew 3.7% sequentially in the March quarter to achieve an all-time record of $275.8 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 20.5% versus the year ago quarter. And for fiscal year '13, our microcontroller business was up 12.4% as compared to fiscal year '12. Microcontrollers represented 64.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. And by the way, in April, we also shipped our 12 billionth cumulative microcontroller.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 7.7% sequentially in the March quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 93% versus the year-ago quarter. And for fiscal year '13, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 74% as compared to fiscal year '12. Fiscal year '13 also marks the eighth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 16-bit microcontroller business. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we are offering and customers that we are serving as we continue to gain market share in this segment.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business took a pause after 3 consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth and was down 16.6% sequentially in the March quarter, although it was up 527% over the year ago quarter. For fiscal year '13, our 32-bit business was up 475% as compared to fiscal year '12. And fiscal year '13 also marks the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 32-bit microcontroller business. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Gartner Dataquest has released their microcontroller market share report for 2012. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain share versus the 8-bit market at large and versus our nearest competitors. 2 years ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot from 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at the time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Over the last 2 years, we closed the gap between us and the #1 supplier, Renesas, and doubled our lead -- we closed the gap by 50%, and we doubled our lead over the #3 supplier, Atmel. And you can expect more of the same in the coming years. And unlike many of our competitors, we achieved these results while maintaining a focus on profitability.","In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2012. We moved up from the #8 spot in 2011 to the #7 spot in 2012. And expect continue to gain share and move up the rankings in the coming years.","In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved from the number #17 in 2011 to the #12 spot in 2012. And once again, we were the fastest-growing major 32-bit microcontroller franchise.","Now Gartner Dataquest report is a backward looking indicator, where we are performing very well. Now let's look at a forward looking indicator. Within the last month, EE Times released their results of their annual embedded market study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. So on all categories, we were #1.","We're honored by the overwhelming preference for our solutions and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where there has -- where some of you have had questions about our choice of core.","Our 2012 market results, as well as the 2012 design engineering preference results, echo market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution and all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is really not important.","Moving to our analog products. Our analog business grew 4.1% sequentially in the March quarter to also achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was up 12 -- 124.4% versus the year ago quarter. While for fiscal year '13, our analog business was up 89.4% as compared to fiscal year '12, easily one of the best-performing analog businesses among our peer group. Analog revenue represented 22.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter, and that's the highest proportion of our revenue ever.","Moving to memory products. This business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was up 1%. While this business has had some drag on our overall growth, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 7.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2014.","We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. In our last conference call, we told you that the December quarter was going to be our bottom quarter for this cycle, and we will see growth in the March quarter. We have more than delivered on that guidance.","Our net sales were higher than the mid-point of our guidance. We managed the operating expenses extremely well, with operating expense percentage coming in 115 basis points below the mid-point and well below the low end of our guidance. All other financial metrics, like gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and non-GAAP earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of our guidance. We beat the mid-point of the guidance on earnings per share by $0.05. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including the new employees from SMSC, for their contribution in making this an excellent quarter.","We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales were a new record. And our total microcontroller, as well as analog net sales achieved all-time new records. Individually, 16-bit microcontrollers also achieved a new all-time record. There's no doubt that Microchip has continued to gain market share in the microcontrollers, as well as analog.","I had a chance to compare Microchip's microcontroller results with the SIA data for the March 2013 that was just released. We are pleased that Microchip continued to gain market share in microcontrollers. For March 2013 quarter, our total microcontroller revenue was $275.8 million. Our overall microcontroller market share increased from 7.6% in March 2012 quarter and 8.25% in calendar year 2012, to 9.7% in the March 2013 quarter. So again, 7.6% in March of 2012 quarter. It was 8.25% in the calendar year 2012. And in the March quarter just finished, 9.7% market share.","Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 90th consecutive profitable quarter. Now we will not break the SMSC numbers out past this quarter and in the new fiscal year. But for the March quarter, the classic Microchip divisions without SMSC achieved an impressive 4.9% sequential growth. The SMSC division's net sales declined by 1.7% sequentially, mainly driven by the computing products division and the PC market weakness.","While we cannot control the PC market, we would like to point out that the SMSC business delivered an impressive $0.085 accretion, which was up from $0.065 accretion in the December quarter and higher than the $0.07 to $0.08 accretion that we had guided. There are lunchtime celebrations planned tomorrow throughout the SMSC sites and the combined Microchip's SMSC integration teams for a job well done. My thanks and congratulations go out to the entire team.","Now looking at the results of our fiscal year 2013, it was a record year for net sales and sales up for microcontroller, as well as analog products.","In November last year, we reported that we instituted a rotating time-off program for our fab employees and substantially reduced the wafer starts in our factories to reduce inventory. The inventory has come down substantially to 116 days, well below the guidance of 123 to 129 days that we provided. We are starting to reduce the amount of the rotating time off, but not completely because the internal component of the inventory is it still a bit high, while the outsourced component of the inventory is low. We expect to end this rotating time off starting July 1. Our longer-term goal for inventory continues to be 115 to 120 days.","In November, we also announced that we instituted a 5% pay cut for all executives, and we then requested other employees of the company to join the executives in a voluntary 5% pay reduction through June 30, 2013. Approximately 2,500 employees had voluntarily stepped up to take a 5% pay cut. We call it shared sacrifice. I want to thank all of the dedicated Microchip employees who volunteered for this pay cut. The participation level exemplifies the strength and uniqueness of the Microchip culture. Tomorrow in a company-wide communication meeting, I will be announcing a reduction in this pay cut from 5% to 2.5% starting the next pay cycle. And the pay cut will go to 0 on July 1. I will also be announcing a special bonus as a shared reward for the employees who made an investment in the shared sacrifice. This bonus is included in the March quarter results, and the reversal of pay cuts is included in our guidance for the June quarter and beyond.","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2014. We have continued to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite requests in our business driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline. The bookings were an all-time record in the March quarter. The starting backlog for June quarter was significantly higher than the starting backlog for the March quarter. However, because of lead times, many new bookings will be scheduled beyond the end of this quarter.","Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the June quarter to be up between 2% and 6% sequentially. We're ramping our back-end facilities in assembly and test to meet the increased demand of our customers. Our back-end facilities have switched from lowering finished goods inventory to now rebuilding finished goods stock to reduce lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers. This switch from lowering finished goods to replenishing finished goods is causing our back-end facilities to grow their units produced by 11% sequentially.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 56.5% to 57% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27.75% to 28.25% of sales, and we expect the operating profit to be between 28.25% to 29.25% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.50 and $0.54 per share.","Remember that our March quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 included a $0.03 credit from the recapture of past R&D credit. Therefore, a mid-point guidance of $0.52 for June quarter is $0.03 above the actual for March quarter.","SMSC is now fully integrated into Microchip. But for reference, the accretion from SMSC will be about $0.09 to $0.10 for the June quarter and between $0.40 to $0.45 for fiscal year '14. This is well above the prior estimate of $0.38 to $0.42 accretion for fiscal year '14. And we have increased that estimate a couple of times before.","We have already made significant progress in transforming SMSC's business model. SMSC's gross margin, operating expenses and operating profits are already significantly better than what SMSC achieved during its full fiscal year prior to the acquisition. SMSC's operating profit in the March quarter was 25.9%, well above the 12% operating profit SMSC recorded in fiscal year '12. So more than doubled. We expect that significant improvement in SMSC financial metrics will continue.","Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus\/minus 0.5%. Operating expense of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. And operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP.","This long-term model will continue to be a premier model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry will continue to generate excellent shareholder value. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Steve, just maybe to start, and given your vantage point in the industry and number of your customers you touch, I think you guys are in good position to answer this. And there's obviously a concern, and it's not just Microchip, it's the whole industry and really, the whole market because of the downturn that happened in the second half of the last 2 years. Because -- I guess, based on what you're seeing now, maybe you could help us by maybe comparing what you're seeing now in terms of the customer orders, the activity to the last 2 years and maybe talk about what you see different this year than perhaps over the last 2 years?","Steve Sanghi","Well, if I could refer to one report I was reading, I don't want to name the report. But I was reading an analyst report from investment analyst, where I read that for my personal investment. It said, in the last 2 years, in both years, Fed drew the stimulus out of the market right around the April timeframe. And last year, the QE2 ended and then they started it again in September or so with QE3. And the year before also, the housing and a bunch of other stimulus ended. And this report at least pointed a significant finger towards really the reduction of that stimulus, which then resulted into a weakening of the market in the second half. And actually, the GDP was already slowing down. This year, as you look at it in the U.S. market at least, the GDP is actually up from the prior quarter. It's accelerating. And there is no sign at least today of any kind of stimulus to be withdrawn. So that's not my analysis. I'm just reading the analysis from a different report. Now as we see from our own data, the bookings are very strong. They were very strong in the last quarter. We mentioned this at the last conference call also. And as we continue, finished the month of April, it was very, very strong. So currently, there is no sign that this thing will really follow the pattern it followed in the last 2 years.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, sure. Just as a follow-up to that. Maybe you can comment a bit about -- it sounds like you're getting some longer-dated bookings now and some customers booking into the calendar third quarter. Does that imply that your own lead times are starting to expand? What's the incentive for your customers to start booking a little farther out right now?","Steve Sanghi","So you pretty much said it. So one change that has happened in the Microchip business over the years is today, 40% of our business comes from wafers made in the foundry. And this is a result of 2 acquisitions and Microchip's own strategy of really significant number of products that we are sourcing from outside. 100% of SMSC's products are bought from foundries. 100% of SST, Silicon Storage Technology products are bought from outside. And many of Microchip products over the years were, rather than adding expensive equipment inside, we have gone outside. So that change in the mix shift has really added the complexity where today, our lead times are anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks depending on the product. And we make 60,000 different product types. So if you ask me, what's your lead time? There isn't really one number. It is anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks-plus. There are products which are in stock, and you can take immediate delivery. And there are other products, so you will be in line if you ordered them in less than 16 weeks. So yes, we're getting orders out in time for products that have longer lead time. And anytime that happens, there is a drag effect on the other products. Even those products which are available on a much shorter term basis, customer just reads it as, those may go longer lead time also or they place a bulk order in a kit fashion for the outer months. And you tend to get bookings on all different products out in time.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just to clarify -- was -- if I look at it versus the second half of last year, was there any meaningful change in the lead times across your portfolio from the second half of last year?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, very, very meaningful change, yes. Obviously, SMSC was acquired in the second half. It was acquired on August 2. So all that impact was since then. And many of our internal products, they have ramped significantly. They were much newer products last year, contributed much smaller portion to our volume. And 1 year later, they are in significantly high volume position.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sumit Dhanda from ISI Group.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The SG&A performance, you came in below the low end of expectations. Could you help us understand what exactly drove that performance?","Steve Sanghi","Go ahead.","James Eric Bjornholt","It's really just great expense control across the board. We've indicated that -- how we share information with our employee base about the state of the industry and expense control. And I'd say, all employees across the company really stepped up and helped us deliver much better performance in the operating expense area. So not much else I can share outside of that other than it was a collective effort of the entire Microchip team.","Steve Sanghi","When employees are on a pay cut and fab employees are on a rotating time off, there's a culture where everyone thinks it's their money. If you spend some money on something superfluous or just want a new computer while the old one still works, you're really spending your own money because the bonuses and pay cut reversal and RTOs and all that depend on the performance. So it's really one of the best cultures, and it creates employees to then really go out of their way in watching expenses and making it an efficient OpEx operation.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, just following up on the, on your commentary around lead times. How do we reconcile the fact that your own internally produced inventory is at a reasonably high level, but your lead times are still expanding? In other words, is the mix so out of kilter with how the demand requests are coming in? Or help us understand what the disconnect might be.","Steve Sanghi","So a lot of the longer lead times are not from in-house produced products. A lot of the longer lead times are from foundry products. But a lot of the in-house produced products, we were holding all the inventory in the die stores, where we have really, in the last many quarters, cut back on the production in assembly and test to not really add further value when the inventories were quite high. And as the demand has come very, very strong, we have to move that die through assembly and test. And that's where some of the challenges are in acquiring new capacity, new handlers, new testers and other stuff. And the third piece is on a good number of -- select number of products. The demand has exploded and the products are built inside, but the inventory on those new products were not very high and the demand has exploded, so we're expediting them even inside the factories.","James Eric Bjornholt","Right. So just to add on to that real quickly. I want to really emphasize the point that Steve made earlier about 40% of our products being from outside foundries. And lead times from our foundry partners have extended also. So that has compounded this. And we've taken appropriate steps to build that inventory back up in the June quarter. And you can see that in our guidance for inventory. Even though the internal inventory is coming down, the foundry product will go up and allow us to have competitive lead times.","Steve Sanghi","So the mix is not out of kilter. If the mix was out of kilter, then we would be writing off inventory because lots of products will have inventory write-downs while the other products are short. So the mix is really not out of kilter. It's -- anytime when large surge in demand happens, lots of new designs take off. And on those new designs, you couldn't predict how much customer is going to buy because they're newer designs and they were in incubation. And many of those are 32-bit microcontrollers and many of them are dsPIC and 16-bit microcontrollers. That's where the demand has exploded.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping you could give us a little detail on the puts and takes to gross margin guidance in the quarter? How should we be thinking about utilization versus last quarter given more modest inventory reductions and are there any impacts from mix shift or other factors that we should also be thinking about?","James Eric Bjornholt","So there's many factors that influence gross margin, including the mix of revenue from our various product lines, fixed cost absorption, factory loading levels, inventory reserves and just general competitive and economic conditions. So after considering those various gross margin factors for the June quarter, we're guiding non-GAAP gross margins to be up to 56.5% to 57%. As our inventory position gets rightsized, we can increase our factory output, which will help us improve our gross margins, and we will see some margin improvement from SMSC over time. So our long-term margin stays intact at 60%, plus or minus 0.5%, and we will get back to those levels as we increase utilization over time.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then as follow-up, if I could. I was hoping you could talk about growth drivers in the 16-bit MCU portfolio given the strong result in the quarter and over the last year. How should we be thinking of the growth profile of this business going forward? And are there any particular applications you're targeting for shagging?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, you can take that one.","Ganesh Moorthy","There are a broad suite of applications in which we're designed in that are continuing to grow. We're getting multiple designs in these applications with these customers. It's too broad of a range to be able to pick any one item to say that's what's driving all the growth. And I think that the strength of the business is, it is not dependent on any one application or any one customer for its growth. It's pretty broad-based.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steven Eliscu from UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just had a question on your 32-bit PIC. I mean, we've focused a lot in the past that the fact you're not using ARM and how it could keep you out of bidding on certain deals. I'd like to turn that around and get your opinion on how when you are included on a deal, how it -- the fact that you have a microcontroller that potentially has advantages versus an ARM core. How that's resulting in what may be less competition than what some of your peers are seeing and how it could also be resulting in better pricing resiliency as we see in 32-bit pricing based on the SIA data come down significantly over the past year.","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","We never sell, based on ARM versus MIPS or everything else on the core. We're going in to customers to understand needs or identifying alternatives, and we propose solutions that are PIC microcontroller-based solutions. That includes the product, includes the development tools, includes the roadmap, includes our software, includes our support. What a customer buys is our ability to solve their needs for today and for tomorrow. And the talk of an ARM core versus a MIPS core versus some other core never comes up.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you're saying you're winning because of all those attributes that you just said?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, there are 10, 15 different attributes that are important to the customer. There may be a few for whom the core may be important, but there's a lot more for whom their success is what's important.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, on the SMSC integration, a couple part question. First of all, just trying to understand why the accretion is higher than you originally expected. Is this just based on better IT integration and rationalization at the back end? Or was there more to it in terms of being able to fix some of the product groups and product areas that you didn't necessarily see upfront? And as a second part, now that also you've honed this M&A process with the last 2 acquisitions and you've essentially said the SMSC integration is complete, are you now ready sooner perhaps to do your next major acquisition?","Steve Sanghi","So the first part of your question regarding the SMSC accretion, I think we have revised these numbers up at least 2 or 3x now. Basically, the execution has been much better than any sand we had left in there. When you first make the estimates, you are largely making the estimate from looking from outside. And first estimate was actually based on the day we completed the acquisition. So as you get in there, as we got in there, we found significant more fat, a significant more areas of efficiency, where Microchip processes, business processes applied related into a significant -- more efficiencies. So the gross margin is significantly higher than we originally imagined. Operating expenses are much lower than we originally imagined. Therefore, the operating profit overall is much higher at lower revenue. So we had expected higher revenue before. So despite lower revenue, mainly because of the computing market, which has been really weak, despite the lower revenue, all other metrics have improved. And a lot of the internal metrics we have regarding revenue per employee to operating expenses, about anything to gross margins, to operating profit per employee, and various other indicators of rank of managers and VPs and directors and others, all these internal indicators are all turning green from bright red when we started. So I can't quite give you a pictorial view of that. Some of the data is confidential on it. But I have a very good chart on how -- where they indicators were, where we started and quarter-after-quarter, month-after-month, how many of these indicators have turned green.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And on the second part of the question?","Steve Sanghi","So the second part of your question is the SMSC acquisition is complete. Are we ready for another major acquisition? We have been ready well before even the acquisition was complete because it's different people executing it versus the people who are finding and doing the analysis. Although, if you know one that's ready and wants to do the deal, let me know, I don't have one.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar from Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Steve, I had a question on 8-bit. We're starting to hear U.S. markets, emerging markets, the end demand recovering. In your opinion, do you think it's possible for Microchip to take further share in the 8-bit market, particularly as Renesas and some of the other guys sort of flounder around in profitability?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I mean, yes, I mean, our 8-bit share is increasing rapidly. Our 8-bit share is up based on SIA data substantially over Q1 last year. It grew every quarter last year. It's up substantially over Q4. Some of the people that have broken their numbers out, including one we just heard yesterday, their 8-bit was down substantially. Sequentially, Microchip's 8-bit was up sequentially from December to March. So our 8-bit is doing very, very well. Don't think negative about 8-bit. 8-bit is resilient, doing very well, we're gaining tremendous share. It has very high gross margins. It's a tremendous contributor to profitability.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, as again, things get better listening to your commentary, a question on CapEx. What are the puts and takes that you guys think about in deciding whether to go outside to a foundry versus going internal? Does it come down at the end to technology? Or is it a total cost proposition?","Steve Sanghi","Well, it's basically, at the end it's a cost of ownership proposition. But a couple of factors that go into that. One, we develop technologies around those business plans that are fairly large business plans, which means we will develop the mainline technologies on which we will do a lot of business. But as the company gets larger, you have a lot of small business plans. We need a little DMOS. We need a little bipolar. We need a little something else. I need a little high voltage. I need something else. So when you start to develop all these versions of technologies for all these splinter groups and small acquisitions and all those in the company, those are not cost-effective necessarily always to develop them inside. So we pretty much go find a foundry who is doing those technologies and we get those. And the second piece is, when you really go deep into lithography, where the equipment becomes very, very expensive into 12-inch wafers, then we are going predominantly outside. Microchip's both fabs are 8-inch, and they will remain 8-inch. So when we really need very deep lithography that's only available on 12-inch, we're going outside.","Operator","We'll go next to Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","Two questions, if I may ask. Is this BodyCom technology important or it takes a few years?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","So BodyCom is a new innovation. We are working with a set of customers to get it adopted and implemented in production. But like most embedded solutions, they take time to be adopted, to be designed and to go to production. So don't expect an instantaneous spike in revenue from BodyCom. It will take time, but it will be like many of our solutions we brought over the years. Where we bring them to market, help customers be successful and ramp the volume.","Gilbert Alexandre","Steve, you've been very good at making economic projections. Can you give us a reading as to degree of slowdown in the Chinese economy?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I don't know if I can claim expertise on the Chinese economy. I read the same data that you read. I have a little more view from our own business standpoint or embedded control regarding what's happening. And the quarter for China was slow, driven by just the weak economy, Chinese New Year, which is always a down quarter, and the change of government, 10 year, a decade change. Every decade the government changes there, which has recently come in. Now what they are talking about are really a new round of stimulus and really trying to accelerate the economy somewhat. And when China does that, a fair amount of money often goes into the hardware goods where our products are. A lot of it goes into appliances, household appliances, TVs, automobiles and other stuff, which really has a lot of Microchip consumption. So if anything like that happens, which looks like its likely to happen, then we will be significant beneficiary.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Williams Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about your internal utilization now? I think it's in the high 50s on the front end. Is that right? And perhaps you're more constrained in the back end. Can you comment on the differential there?","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes. We don't break out a specific capacity utilization percentage. We do have plenty of capacity in our factory to support both the short term and long-term requirements of the business. It's just quite a mix today. We talked about earlier about 40% of our business being outsourced in wafer fab. And what we're doing internally coming off the rotating time-off schedules effective July 1. So it's just a lot of moving parts. I can assure you, we have plenty of capacity to grow into internally, though.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then there's another area of your business where I think you've done some smaller acquisitions and people -- investors, I think don't generally think of Microchip as a company with a strong position in touch and gesture and proximity controls. But I think you've developed some products there lately. Could you talk about the traction you've made there?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I mean, we have a very good touch business. We do business with over 1,000 touch customers in production, always has been. But our business characteristics is such that Microchip defends a very, very broad beachfront. We're not a touch company. We're not a motor control company. We're not a computing company. We're not a cell phone company. We participate everywhere with a very, very broad set of characteristics. So therefore, we don't really talk about any single application because there's just too many to talk about. Every once in a while, we throw something out and most people just think, hey, that's our focus. And we have a large portion of the business in that area, which is not true. The difference in touch is, with our touch, we're not pursuing cell phones and pads. Our touch is in automotive. Our touch is in industrial. Our touch is in printers, on touch screens, on various buttons and wheels and stoves and industrial equipment and household equipment. That's where our touch is. Margins are 2x higher than our competition or more. There are smaller volumes in a given design. They're support intensive, but Microchip is structured around being able to provide that. We don't go compete in a 20 million unit design in a cell phone. But we sell well over 20 million units in lots of small, small and mundane applications in the industrial and automotive and consumer world.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.","Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Shaon Baqui calling in for Chris. I want to circle back real quick on a pretty well-publicized letter you guys put out, I think in the first week of February to your customers. Can you talk about what kind of impact that letter had on the order rates throughout the quarter? And maybe talk about the last time you had to issue a similar letter and what it did to order patterns?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the letter is not to create an order pattern. The letter is in response to a order pattern. So for several weeks, prior to the letter, we were getting a large amount of orders and some of the lead times had pushed out, and we talked about lead time earlier in the conversation regarding products made in foundries to some other products which are ramping very hard. So when that starts to happen, the letter is essentially giving all of our other customers a notice because Microchip has a very broad, 80,000 customers, very broad customer base. So it's to give a notice to every other customer and saying, \"This is what's happening in our industry. This is what we are seeing. Please make sure that you have your orders in either at your distributor or at Microchip wherever you buy the parts from and take notice that this is happening.\" And usually, we didn't see any change in the pattern after that. But the pattern continued for quite a while and is continuing. It is possible that without the letter, the whole thing could have softened a little bit. And we know maybe after those customers were placing the order have placed their orders. But then when the other customers will come later on, they wouldn't have the orders in line, and they will go delinquent, their line is down. So it's a notice to the other customers, which then customer after customer then get on the bandwagon and are placing their orders which keeps the momentum rolling for an extended period of time, which is really what has happened.","Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And this is a quick follow-up along those same lines. Can you talk about where your lead times are today versus the beginning of the year and when do you plan on bringing those down?","Steve Sanghi","I don't know whether you were on the call earlier on or you just signed in. But we talked quite a bit about the lead times. Microchip's lead times are anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks-plus. And there's no single number I could give you for lead time. Across the 60,000-plus products we make, the lead time is really product-dependent depending on where the product is made, whether it's made in foundry, whether it's made inside, whether we have die inventory on that product, only have to test it, or we have to start from scratch making wafers. So the lead times are all over the place. Lead times have not changed since the start of this year.","Operator","We'll go next to John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, in your prepared comments, you gave us a metric that you usually don't give. I think you talked about the back end, perhaps, building units up 11% sequentially in the June quarter. Was the intent there to give us a sense of what you think underlying consumption could be, if you could meet it all? Is it expectation of future growth into September? What was the point of that data point?","Steve Sanghi","The point of that data was that in the prior quarter, we shipped more units than we built. So we were in the inventory depletion mode. And now, with the growth guidance we have given, you have to build more units. Plus, you -- I can't deplete them anymore, inventory is already low in our back end. I have to build more units to grow the inventory, plus I have to make up for the units I depleted last quarter. So it's just to give you a feel for -- ties into lead times also a little bit. We're having to grow the units 11% just to provide the growth we have guided, plus the units we depleted last year, from last quarter from the finished goods, replenish those, plus not deplete anymore and actually build some. And we have given you a range of guidance. So anytime we build, we build so that we can provide more than the middle point of the guidance.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Steve, on the SMSC accretion that you guys have raised a couple of times now, it sounds like a lot of that's coming on the cost side. I'm kind of curious now that we're a few quarters into this, what kind of revenue synergies you might have uncovered? And then, quickly and lastly, just given the yen situation, how do we think about yen relative to your business?","Steve Sanghi","We don't really think much about yen. We don't really buy stuff from Japan. We don't have any factories there. We ship product in Japan, but our pricing to our distributors is in dollars. So our products may become more cost-effective or less cost-effective based on yen. So if the customer has our design versus Renesas' design, they might see that difference, but most of our products that are sold in Japan are all proprietary. So it's not been a major discussion at Microchip when yen changes.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Helpful. And then on the SMSC, the accretion, what kind of revenue synergies have you guys uncovered?","Steve Sanghi","Well, quite a bit. So we're finding that SMSC's USB and Ethernet products and other common products have homes in lots and lots of Microchip sockets where we are shipping our microcontroller, serial and other products. And they were either using somebody else's Ethernet or they can add additional capability by having that connectivity. In addition, lots and lots of USB sockets, where they have large customers, many of them we did not do business with and we're finding that they need a memory or they need an analog or they need a microcontroller. And a lot of these things have design cycles and design cycle for anything these days is about 1 year, 1.5 years. So SMSC acquisition is less than 1-year old. So there is not a lot of retained revenue, although there is some, but there's a lot more coming in future.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Harsh Kumar from Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Following up on that question, Steve, maybe if I remember SMSC had a pretty strong and dynamic automotive line. I know that the time to get in that kind of business is a little bit longer than most. But I was wondering if you could shed some light on how long it may take to see some benefits of cross-selling there on that particular business?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, you want to comment on that?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, I mean, I think you're right. SMSC did have a strong automotive product line and a very proprietary one at that. They also had the added advantage of influencing designs at an architectural level with the carmakers and not just working with the Tier 1s that most semiconductor companies work with, but with the Tier 1s customer, end customer who are OEMs. And in that, we're getting insight into how those platforms are evolving over time and how other Microchip solutions can be proposed and included as the early stage design of platforms are taking place. But as you noted, these are long design cycles. You won't see any of it in the next 1, 2, 3 years. It'll take time before they are done, go into production. But slowly but surely as with all of our other embedded models, these are our long-term growth initiatives.","Operator","And with no further questions in the phone queue, I would like to turn the call back to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Well, we just want to thank all the investors and analysts for joining this call. We will see some of you on the road this quarter at some of the shows and conferences and all that. Otherwise, we will talk to you next quarter in another earnings call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.","We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website.","I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer.","As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and each quarter we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand.","End-market demand in the September 2019 quarter was $1.346 billion. End-market demand was about $8.6 million more than our GAAP revenue in the quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.","Net sales in the September quarter were $1.338 billion, which was down 1.15% sequentially and modestly below the midpoint of our guidance of $1.349 billion. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were near all-time highs at 62.24%, operating expenses were at 25.56% and operating income was 36.7%. Non-GAAP net income was 365.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1 43, which was in line with the midpoint of our guidance.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.9% and included the impact of 5.2 million of share based compensation. Total operating expenses were 643.9 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of 248.2 million, special charges of 3.6 million, 10.1 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of 40.1 million. The GAAP net income was 108.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share.","Our September quarter, GAAP tax benefits included 12.7 million of net discrete income tax benefits related to tax reserve releases, due to statute of limitations expiring, partially offset by a foreign tax assessment. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.5% in the September quarter and was negatively impacted by foreign tax assessment that Microchip will pay in fiscal year 2020, but defendant\u2019s position and seek a refund of these taxes in the future. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to be between 6% and 7%. Exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global tax structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits, as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about 236 million and will be paid over the next six years. We have posted the schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Our inventory balance at September 30, 2019 was 734.2 million. We had 131 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, down one day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were at 30 days compared to 32 days at the end of June. We have only had one quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels.","The cash flow from operating activities was 396 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was 405.1 million. We paid down 315.5 million of total debt in the September quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by 283.5 million. Over the last full five quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down 1.729 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt.","We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was 540.2 million, and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 2.178 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and as more equity like in nature was 4.59 at September 30 2019. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was 87.3 million.","Capital expenditures were 17.7 million in the September quarter. We expect between 20 million and 25 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million, a $25 million reduction from the forecast we provided last quarter.","We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Actel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was 39.5 million.","I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how Microchip measured its performance internally. Also, as I go through the product line reports, they will reflect continued broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. This broad weakness was further accentuated in the month of September.","Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1.3%, as compared to the June quarter. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including the industry's first commercially available serial memory solid-state drive controller, which won the Best-of-Show award in the 2019 Flash Memory Summit, as well as two different USB Type-C Power Delivery controllers, which enabled fast device charging and simplifies implementation of this functionality. Microcontrollers represented 53.3% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.","Now moving to analog. Our analog business are sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the June quarter. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the introduction of the Trust Platform for CryptoAuthenticaion, the industry's first pre-provision solution providing secure key storage for small and large volumes. Analog represented 28.7% of our end-market demand in the September quarter,","Our FPGA business was sequentially down 8.9%, as compared to the June quarter. As we have mentioned in prior conference calls, the FPGA business does have some lumpiness, because of a significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets where procurement timing can be a function of programs and they're shifting priorities, schedules and budgets.","During the quarter, we announced our Smart Embedded Vision initiative, providing for designing intelligent machine vision systems with our low power PolarFire FPGAs. Design wins for the PolarFire family continue to grow strongly. And we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family. FPGA represented 6.8% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.","Our licensing memory and other product line which we refer to as LMO was sequentially up 10.5% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. Strength in our licensing business, as well as our timing systems business outpaced the broader macro weakness we experienced. LMO represented 11.2% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.","In September, we completed the acquisition of two small early stage private companies. The first acquisition enables low power embedded computing solutions for machine learning inference, and smart embedded vision applications for our FPGA product families. This acquisition also adds domain knowledge depth in the areas of machine learning algorithms and vector processing.","The second acquisition provides digital gate driver solutions for wide bandgap MOSFET and IGBT Technologies. The acquisition complements our silicon carbide discrete and modular power conversion offerings, and enables us to provide more comprehensive total system solutions.","These two acquisitions were very small and more akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser focused areas. The combined cash outflow was less than $6 million and hence not material to the rate at which we're paying down our debt.","Finally, a quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration. We continue to plow forward with the business systems and operations integrations. On the business systems front, we went live with a few more systems on November 1. And as I mentioned on prior conference calls, this is a tedious and time consuming effort and we estimate that we're about 50% of the way to completion and have about another year of work ahead of us. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we close the transaction, despite the week of macro environment, and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come.","Let me now pass it to Steve for his comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2020.","Our September quarter GAAP net says based on selling revenue recognition was $1.338 billion, up 1.15% sequentially versus a guidance of flat to a 4%. So we missed the GAAP sales guidance slightly at the midpoint. Our end-market demand based on sell through was $8.6 million higher than GAAP sales, which we believe shows that the channel is continuing to manage the working capital conservatively by reducing inventory, due to uncertainty.","Recall that we call the bottom of the cycle back in February of 2019, contingent on resolution of the U.S. China trade dispute. This trade settlement did not happen and remains unresolved. Since then, our end-market demand has been flat at 1.34 billion, 1.35 billion and 1.346 billion for March, June and September quarters respectively, due to multitude of headwinds from trade tensions, and resulting impact on automotive industrial and consumer appliance end-markets.","Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 62.24% was just above the high end of our guidance and was near a record high. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.7% was also higher than the midpoint of our guidance of 36.2%. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely. Since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvements in growth and operating margins for Microsemi products. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.43 right at the midpoint of our guidance. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 116 consecutive profitable quarter.","In the September quarter, we paid down $315.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payments since the end of June 2018 has been $1.73 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong, despite the weekend uncertain business conditions as we continue to squeeze working capital.","Now before I provide you guidance for the December quarter, let me comment on geographical and end-market sales. While the uncertainty begins with U.S. China trade friction, the uncertainty has become global. The week business conditions can be seen in all geographies. Our Americas business in September quarter based on end-market demand was down 6.1% over a year ago quarter, Europe was down 12.9%, and Asia was down 12.6%. We did expedience our business being weaker in September than we had expected in the month of September. This weakness was also reflected in the lower studying backlog for the December quarter as well as the unusually low distribution inventory exiting the September quarter.","From an end-market standpoint, industrial, automotive and consumer appliances end-markets are down significantly, aerospace and defense and communication markets have been flattish, and data center market has been strong. The uncertainty in all geographies is continuing. In this environment, direct customers and especially the distributors are continuing to manage the working capital by reducing inventory.","However, there are some signs of inflection point too. In the September quarter, distributor inventory was down to 29.6 days. We have had only one quarter in the past 15 years, which was the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, where our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels.","Secondly, booking for the month of October were the highest booking achieved since June of 2018. While the backlog for December quarter is much lower than the backlog for September quarter, at the same point in the quarter, the slope of the backlog fill for the current quarter is much steeper. With steeper backlog fill, where the backlog in shipments end up is a guessing game, especially with the holidays coming. Our judgment is that the net sales based on selling revenue recognition will take another leg down this quarter. But with several indicators showing inflection point, we may see the forming of a bottom here even though we saw a false bottom back in the March of this year when trade dispute was not resolved.","We expect GAAP net sales based on selling revenue recognition for our products to be between minus 2% to minus 10% sequentially in the December quarter. Due to this sharp reduction in GAAP sales at the midpoint of the guidance, we are taking steps to reduce our manufacturing capacity, capital expenditures as well as expenses.","We are planning to reduce the clean room footprint in our Colorado 6-inch fab that we acquired with Atmel acquisition. At 6-inch wafer size, the fab is no longer competitive with other high volume 8-inch fab. Therefore we will be turning the 6-inch fab into a discrete and specialty fab doing silicon carbide field effect transistors, the transistors, MEMS and other discrete devices. We will be transferring high volume Atmel products from the 6-inch Colorado fab to our 8-inch fab in Arizona and Oregon. This transfer will take about 12 months to complete, largely because we brought up the highest volume process in 8-inch fabs for dual sourcing earlier.","In addition, we will be transferring some of the discrete products from Microsemi 4-inch fabs to the 6-inch fab in Colorado. These actions will create about $65 million in cost of good savings per year when completed. The first phase of this transfer will take about one year to complete and will achieve about two thirds of the savings. The balance of the transfers have a long tail and we\u2019ll take another two years after the first phase.","Regarding capital expenditures, we\u2019re reducing our CapEx for fiscal year 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million for the year, a reduction of $25 million from our guidance on CapEx last quarter. Regarding the reduction OpEx, we\u2019re doing three things. Some of those are continuation of what we have been doing. First, we are approving new and replacement acquisitions very sparingly. Second, we will be managing discretionary spending very tightly. And third, our bonus program will yield a lower payout for the reduction in net sales.","For December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% and 61% of sales \u2013 gross margin to be between 61% and 61.4% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 28% of sales. We expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 33% and 35.2% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 per share to $1.32 per share.","Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] All right, we\u2019ll take our first question from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question Steve, is the expectations for sell-in versus sell through in the December quarter. You already said that the distribution channel inventory is at a record low. So, is this guidance for December suggesting that that end demand is actually declining in December? Could you explain the difference there?","Steve Sanghi","The end demand is declining. There has been some destruction of end demand in various end-markets. So, automotive clearly where the number of units build in automotive are much lower in U.S., Europe, and China. The industrial market end demand has been weaker because of all the impact of tariffs and increased cost and similar thing we\u2019re seeing in the home appliances market. So, yes, the end demand is weaker and sell-in we\u2019re guiding down. We do not know what the net to distribution inventory will be in terms of increasing or decreasing, whether end-market demand will be higher than GAAP sales or lower slightly. But we think they could be roughly in the same range and could go either way.","Chris Caso","Right. Okay. As a follow-up then, maybe you can reconcile that with your comments of the potential of this inflection point. I guess what I understand you\u2019re saying is the opening backlog coming into the quarter was lower, but you\u2019re seeing stronger fill as you go through the quarter. How are you reconciling that better order fill with the prospect of end demand, perhaps a bit weaker?","Steve Sanghi","So, how we are reconciling it is the starting backlog in the quarter was significantly more weaker than minus 6% guidance at the midpoint, significantly weaker. So, some of that \u2013 fair amount of that has closed in the last five weeks because the curve of backlog fill is much deeper. And we are expecting that that kind of curve will continue and will end up really close to the guidance for providing, but where we end up would still be lower than the last quarter. It will require significantly more steeper curve to be even with the last quarter. So, we are expecting improvement because of steeper curve, but it doesn\u2019t get us to flat compare to last quarter.","Ganesh Moorthy","Yeah, and it probably is worth repeating what Steve has already said that our October 2019 bookings were the strongest month of bookings we\u2019ve seen since June 2018.","Chris Caso","All Right. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","For the kind of a lot of mixed messages, weaker backlog, but some inflection points and still leaves very hard to read in this environment. We said back in February that could be bottom, but it was very much tied to the trade settlement. We didn\u2019t get it. So, this time, we\u2019re just being cautious and giving you all the puts and takes.","Chris Caso","Right. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go with Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that sort of the retooling of your Colorado facility could bring on maybe a 50 basis point positive impact to gross margin long term. The near term looks like we\u2019re contemplating the 100 basis point sequential decrease. How much of that degradation, the gross margin near term is due to underutilization and how much is due to mix?","Ganesh Moorthy","I can address that and Steve can add on to it. So, the quarter we just completed, we had underutilization charge are about $8.9 million. That charge will be higher in the December quarter. So, that is having an impact on gross margins that we\u2019re seeing on a sequential basis. There\u2019s always things like product mix that factor into it also. And then with demand down, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll have some accounting charges related to obsolescence doesn\u2019t mean that the product isn\u2019t good anymore, but we\u2019ll have some obsolescence charges that will also impact the gross margins that we produce this quarter.","Gary Mobley","Okay. And just \u2013 I know it\u2019s very, very early to call, but could you give us some sense of seasonal trends in the March quarter, based on past history and perhaps how you are feeling about the linearity bookings as we see here today?","Steve Sanghi","Well, seasonality is the hardest one to talk about, because of various acquisitions that we have completed. Prior to the Microsemi acquisition, for example, our end-market mix was dominated by industrial, automotive and consumer appliances. With the addition of Microsemi now, we have added three other significant end-markets, aerospace and defense, datacenter and communication where we had very little exposure. And last year, year or five quarters since we\u2019ve had Microsemi, the environment hasn\u2019t been normal. A significant inventory correction in the last June and September of last year, and then subsequently, fighting through the U.S. China trade sanctions and all the other issues. So, we haven\u2019t really seen a combined company normal environment for a year or longer to be able to figure out what the seasonality with the current mix is.","So, I think that would be my answer that we \u2013 at the minus 6% of the midpoint, clearly that is below seasonal. We\u2019re not defending that it is seasonal. Prior to any of this acquisition, I think seasonality for December quarter used to be about minus 3 if I remember. We don\u2019t know where it is today.","Gary Mobley","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Vivek Arya from the Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was hoping you could help us understand the chronology here, because back in August, you gave some guidance, then in September, you kind of confirm the midpoint of that guidance. At that time, the hope was that September would be a normal month. And since then, the results are about, 11-ish million somewhat below. So, not bad, but somewhat below. And since that time, we have just heard such a wide range of views from here, you know one of your peers was very weak, but then most others have kind of been in line. And now, you\u2019re saying that October bookings are very strong but backlog is very weak. I think investors are just horribly confused as to what\u2019s really going on, what is driving such a week backlog and what is now driving the subtitle, what is causing all this?","Steve Sanghi","Vivek, in terms of confusion, join the party. I mean this has been a very, very confusing environment. On one hand, they\u2019ve been fits and starts on the trade front, and the three largest of our markets which are industrial, automotive and consumer appliances heavily hit with large amount of tariffs and therefore they have a lot of demand destruction. In anytime you make any kind of guess with some resolution of the trade dispute, it really hasn\u2019t happened. And then you have had multitude of other issues with ZTE about a year ago then Huawei, you can ship is, not shipping then Hikvision and many other customers added. So, there has been a lot of confusion. And every company \u2013 I think if you look at the number a year-over-year, you will see that our performance year-over-year is pretty reasonable, but quarter-over-quarter, it just depends on when somebody went into inventory correction, how long the inventory correction lasted. We measured our September performance to the September performance of last year. However, September last year, we were still reporting numbers based on sell through revenue recognition as a non-GAAP. If you compare the numbers GAAP to GAAP, September quarter to September quarter, we were actually up, because last September quarter there was a substantial reduction in distribution inventory. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exactly correct.","Ganesh Moorthy","Yeah, we were not up but we had about an $80 million reduction last September in distribution inventory in that quarter.","Steve Sanghi","Yeah. So, as you compared to that, the number of get very confusing. So, in parallel with all these other confusions, last year, we also went through change of revenue recognition. So, I would say simply lay out the numbers for various companies and you will find that our year-over-year performance is better than the other large competitor you talked about.","Ganesh Moorthy","Vivek, in terms of chronology, the other thing to keep in mind is, if you remember, I think it was in early August, there were additional tariffs that were announced and were going to be taking place at various points in time. I think that creates more uncertainty in the market. And I think what happened was September ended up being a lot weaker as people were trying to sort out, customers are trying to sort out, what are they going to do. And that was reflected in distribution inventory going down, the overall results being less than what we had expected at the midpoint, and then beginning to reverse as we went into October, and then reflected in the guidance you\u2019re seeing today.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And my follow-up, Steve, how much do you think distributors will be willing to take down inventory that you mentioned, this is the lowest that you\u2019ve seen in the last I think 15 years or so that you mentioned definitely far below historical trends. What are you hearing from them? I understand the uncertainty, but at some point, do you think you see the benefits of perhaps say DIB crunching from the distribution channel or is it too early to give a sense for \u2013 what does normalize distribution level look for you?","Steve Sanghi","I think the macro trends in the demand destruction by the tariffs and all this confusion created a much larger impacts than the other secular trends of impact of another competitors in distribution and distribution putting more focus on us. Those things happen over two, three years. And the effect of trade friction and all that is really much more immediate and much more severe. So, we\u2019ve been telling you now for a few quarters that the distribution inventory went down, the sell through in several quarters now, I would say at least five quarters had been better than sell-in. And when would think with distribution inventory now, lowest in 15 years except one strange quarter in fiscal year \u201813. It wouldn\u2019t go down further, but we can\u2019t be sure of it. Distributors don\u2019t have confidence. The seeing the same issues we are seeing weakness in industrial market in automotive market and consumer appliance market, aerospace and defense and communications that kind of flattish, if distributors can manage their business, but even lower inventory they probably would.","Ganesh Moorthy","Right. They are going to leverage are generally short lead times to their advantage.","Steve Sanghi","Despite, reporting GAAP numbers based on selling you\u2019re very well aware of a stance. We manage a business to sell through and we do not go request any distributor to take any kind of inventory stock for shelves. So, we are focused on sell through and sell through is weak and therefore the selling is weak.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for the comment.","Operator","Thanks. We will be taking our next question from Harsh Kumar from the Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Yeah, thanks, Steve, for all the colors so far. I\u2019m trying to square some of your comments. So, you\u2019re taking some steps in OpEx and CapEx, but October suggesting from your commentary some sort of an inflection point upward. So, should we just read into it as okay maybe we\u2019re not going to go down from the current guidance that you gave for December that sort of the new base should we look at and you\u2019re just adjusting your business to get out? I guess be more profitable and more cash flow and just optimize it a little bit or is it from the last can read into it?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think what I'm reading into it is that we started the December quarter with much lower backlog on October 1 than it was in July 1. And you know if that had continued in the last five weeks, the guidance would be double digit negative. But we have made up significant gap by the fill being much stronger. And if that strength of that fill continues, then the results could be reasonably good. But there are also holidays coming, short month of November, short month of December, you know, Europe shuts off in the middle of December. So by all those puts and takes, our guess is that the December quarter still ends up about 6% lower than September quarter. And that minus 6% is a huge makeup from how low the backlog was in October one.","And then with the strength of the bookings, October was strong bookings, November so far looks like good strong bookings. If the bookings continue, then hopefully the January one backlog for the March quarter could be better than what we experienced as a backlog on October 1. And with continued strength of booking, hopefully, we have some sort of recovery, but I'm not really giving any guidance for March yet.","Harsh Kumar","Understood. Thanks for the color, Steve. And I think earlier you mentioned that the classic Microchip as you call your core business from some acquisition to go typically down about 3% in December. You think some of that and maybe the Chinese New Year stack kind of closer to Christmas this time has some effect on you know, some small portion of your consumer business, you think part of that's going on, perhaps impacting September and then coming back up in October?","Steve Sanghi","I think, you know, earlier gentleman asked that we gave guidance in early September that we reconfirmed our midpoint of our guidance. So kind of what happened, you know Ganesh mentioned and I mentioned also the month of September was quite weak. Weaker than what we expected causing us to miss a sales by about $10 million, $11 million. You know, the month of October was much stronger and November is continuing much stronger. So, you know, could it be because of some sort of light at the end of the tunnel on first phase of settlement with China, could be the inventory has gone low enough. You know, there are all these puts and takes and we really have put them all on the table, you know, the good points and bad points. And then we gave you a judgment and you could make your own judgment or agree or disagree with ours. That's where it is. Numbers are very hard to call in this uncertain environment.","Harsh Kumar","Understood, Steve. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. We are taking next Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first would be, is there any way to quantify, I know you've talked about it a lot so far, just how much September disappointed in terms of either the backlog or actual sales? Would you have been tracking toward the higher end of guidance, otherwise?","Steve Sanghi","No. I mean when we reconfirmed our guidance, we were essentially tracking towards the midpoint. And September was weak causing us to miss by 11 million, am I correct? Yeah.","Shawn Harrison","And that's the amount that we should consider what the shortfall was also and kind of general backlog as well?","Steve Sanghi","No, the backlog was much, much weaker.","Ganesh Moorthy","Remember backlog cross us over into the December quarter and exceeding quarters as well.","Steve Sanghi","And then you know earlier I mentioned that the backlog started on October 1, the backlog was down in double digits compared to July 1. And if we are giving minus 6% guidance now you know even if 4% change would be $52 million, right, on our revenue number. And the backlog on October 1 started much worse than minus 10, significantly worse than minus 10. So, we have made up a huge amount of gap with significantly steeper slope.","Shawn Harrison","Very helpful. And just as a follow-up...","Steve Sanghi","Today ruler on the slope and get to a number and tell you that's the number. Unfortunately we have seen that you know, when the backlog start so low, can be a steeper slope but then the slope can change and it could end early in the middle of December and not fill during the holidays. So you got account for all that and that's why I keep stressing that there are lots of puts and takes. And putting them all into consideration, we're giving you guidance that we believe is where we're headed.","Shawn Harrison","It's very helpful. Steve, if I may a follow-up. Just the incremental weakness you saw in the backlog, was it more on the analog side of the portfolio or the microcontroller side?","Steve Sanghi","It was largely pretty much across the board.","Ganesh Moorthy","There's no product specific backlog that was weaker than the other.","Shawn Harrison","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We're next going to William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, you've already told us that the weakness was very broad based by markets and by geo. I wonder if the strength or the very recent strong recovery in bookings trends could be attributed to anything in particular, any geo, any end-market, any event.","Steve Sanghi","So, I would say, if you have to pick a geography that has shown strength, it would be China.","William Stein","But nothing by end-market there. We've heard about China auto recovering significantly. Are you seeing that as well?","Steve Sanghi","Yeah, I mean, you know, we manage our business by product lines as you know. So, you know, we have rough end-market commentary, where we believe that the only stronger end-market has been data centers, communication and aerospace and defense were flattish, and automotive industrial and consumer appliances were the weakest markets. You know with a one month booking in October, we can't really, you know, tell you a change in that tone. We just don't track it that way.","William Stein","Thanks. One more if I can. With regards to the Microsemi system, that ERP integrations that you're doing. Can you remind us of the timing to complete these? And I just forget whether there's a step function cost savings that happens at the end of it all? Or is it more linear as we go and remind us of the size of that, please? Thank you.","Ganesh Moorthy","So if you recall, we began this a year ago, and have had a number of transitions we make every quarter. We just did the most recent of that on November 1 of this year. In my prepared remarks, I said we have at least another four quarters to get substantially complete. We're about halfway through at this point in time. And the savings are more over time rather than a step function change. And as we get through enough of the systems, you know, we take the savings and that becomes a synergy that we add to what we've done.","Operator","All right, thank you. We're next going with Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's always tricky to reconcile SIA data with your results, but if I look at SIA data for calendar Q3, the overall general MCU market grew about 5% sequentially. But almost all of that growth came from 32-bit, while 8-bit decline, 16-bit was relatively flattish sequentially. You've grown the size of your 32-bit pretty strongly, but I think it's still about a third of your overall MCU business. So mix adjusted because you still have more 8-bit and 16-bit exposure. Is this the potential reason why your MCU business slightly underperformed the general industry in the September quarter?","Steve Sanghi","We have not analyzed the numbers again for SIA, so I'd rather not guess and make any comments. I think you know our \u2013 you mentioned end-market demand base microcontroller business was down 1.3%. I think many other results we have heard from various companies wouldn't lead us to believe that the business in September quarter was up 5%. I don't know how SIA comes up with the numbers, if you add up the numbers from TI and others, I don't know whether I can construct that number.","Ganesh Moorthy","Our 32-bit business is doing, you know, much stronger than 8-bit and 16-bit. I think these are businesses that are not as much 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit focused. They are broad market trends in automotive and industrial, in consumer appliances and they affect all segments of the microcontroller market.","Steve Sanghi","Our belief is in history that you know SIA, you know, especially during turbulent times like this, they revise the numbers and the significant changes reported and it's easily causes confusion like it's causing right now. If I look at, add up the results of most companies, they make microcontrollers, I don't really think I can get SIA numbers.","Harlan Sur","You know, that's a fair point. Okay. And then my follow-up, you know, you've been to a couple of quarters of cloud data centers spending digestion, but looks like spending is picking up back here in the second half of this year. It looks like you guys are seeing that as well. I think via the Microsemi acquisition, you guys have a relatively strong position in NVMe enterprise is the controllers, you've got a strong platform for PCIe switching products. And then you've got some of your core products right like secure MCUs and Ethernet products that go into the cloud as well. Roughly how big is cloud data center as an end-market for the team? I assume it's probably a bit easier to track given that these products are purpose designed for data center applications?","Ganesh Moorthy","So the product lines that address data center are more than just the Microsemi product line that came to data center. Clearly that is a big position that we have some of what you mentioned relative to these strength and storage. The strength in the SSDs and all that is good. I don't know if I have a good way to break out exactly what our data center. It's in the mid-teens is what my guess would be based on where we had seen the combined company, but that's from several quarters ago.","Steve Sanghi","We also have products into data center from the classic Microchip business prior to the Microsemi. And some of those products go into power supplies, they go into, you know, other IO control and various different areas. So, we had some data center exposure before, but obviously, the big one came in Microsemi.","Harlan Sur","Yeah. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much for your question. [Operator Instruction] We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'll give it to one. The October bookings strength that the company spoke to, are those primarily bookings that are for shipment in the December quarter, or are some of those bookings for shipping in the March quarter and maybe giving you a good start on your backlog for the March quarter? Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","Those bookings are aged every month from here on and into the future six, eight months out. So some are for December quarter, some are for March quarter, some of it even spill beyond the match quarter.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, to the entire December quarter, you've been pretty clear that your assumptions for terms are higher. I'm just kind of curious, given the strength you've seen quarter to date, from here on out, what's the expectations in terms of returns relative to trend? Do you expect \u2013 you need that steepness to continue to hit the midpoint or you embedding kind of a more normal turns in business in the second half of the quarter to hit the midpoint of guidance?","Steve Sanghi","So I'll speak qualitatively rather than quantitatively because we haven't disclosed what the backlog was, where it is now and all that. If the current slope of backlog fill continues, then the results will be very good. We're not expecting the slop to continue. So we in our judgment have moderated that slope, current slope. Some just because the backlog started very low and then people place the order, slope is high, as backlog starts to fill up, the slope will moderate. And the other is the effect of holidays, because you know, you don't do a lot of bookings over the Thanksgiving week. And then December, Europe is weak as usually, U.S. is second and then you know, Asia usually continues to work over the holidays. So we have based on our experience from our history, we have model that in. But I will admit that we have moderated that slope because we think the slope is not sustainable.","Eric Bjornholt","I think I'll also point out that we've given broad range of guidance.","Steve Sanghi","And we have given a pretty broad range of guidance to account for all those puts and takes.","Operator","Thank you. We're taking our next question from Chris Danely from Citigroup.","Christopher Danely","Hey, thanks, guys. I'll try to stick to one question. Steve, is this I guess, sluggish type of environment continues into the March quarter. Theoretically, what would you be looking to do as far as OpEx goes in your own inventory?","Steve Sanghi","Well, if the sluggish environment were to continue, the OpEx would be basically in the range. We will keep on you know, controlling any headcount additions, sparingly approve any replacement acquisitions. Bonus will continue to be lower, you know, then the target type of bonuses. You know, CapEx will, you know, continue to tighten, because if there's no growth, we will need capacity. And a lot of the capital we're investing is just incremental here and there is no big capital needed for growth in this environment. So, you know, those are the things we would do if the environment continues to be sluggish. If the environment were to accelerate, you know, I would think we still have sufficient capacity and sufficient inventory to ship the upside. So you wouldn't see a growth in, you know, CapEx immediately and you wouldn't see growth in expenses either. So if the upside in revenue were to come through, I think there will be a pretty good leverage for the earnings to go to the bottom.","Christopher Danely","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next go with Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Rakesh","Thanks. Just Steve and Eric, just briefly \u2013 you talked about inventory has come down quite a bit. I was just wondering if the visibility extended to the end customer also, have you seen the end customers stock up ahead of the tariffs or you think inventories going out to the end customers have come down as well?","Ganesh Moorthy","You know, we really have no meaningful visibility into end customers and what they're doing with their inventory. They don't report to us. We don't see the change from week to week as we do in the case of distribution. So you know, they are \u2013 we presume doing what they think is the right thing for their business. But we have no color one way or the other.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And I know you mentioned October you saw a nice snapback or a pickup in backlog most different China. Given the \u2013 Steve mentioned auto and industrial where the weakest, would expect those to snap back faster than others if we see some rebounder? That's it. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","So it's really hard to call future by end-markets. It's easier to talk about the past. Yeah, if there's some sort of trade settlement, there was to be clear rules were overnight to another tweet, you know, the duties will not go higher or something then you would see some stability and return to normalcy on the industrial market and appliance market. Automotive, there is a settlement with GM and GM know, and so you should see some impact there. So I think those are the things that would show strength. Yes.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We'll next go with Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna International Group.","Christopher Rolland","Thanks for the question. Steve, thanks for all this big picture stuff. In your experience, maybe you can talk about how this cycle has been different from prior ones. You know, kind of what most surprised you this time around? And then how do you feel about this being a more of a semiconductor specific driven cycle versus you know, an economic cycle? And do you have any thoughts on an economic cycle, given how long this economic cycle has lasted?","Steve Sanghi","Well, that's a tough ball that you have served. You know I'm not an economist and that's not my field. So I'll give you some feel for really, you know how I'm thinking. Many of the cycles our industry has seen are the cycles created by our own industry through lonely times, excessive inventory build, and then the bubble bursting and going the other way and company shipping below demand for a while and then the cycle correcting. So those are, you know, semiconductor industry and its customer cause cycles by successively under shipping demand and over shipping demand. This cycle hasn't been caused by the industry. This cycle has been caused by the much larger economic forces. And if I were to name a single one, it will be the U.S. China trade. It\u2019s really been caused by that.","I tried to explain it before and let me take another shot at it. The world economy runs on manufactures building the product and putting into the inventory with a forecast that the customers will come and buy that product. Now given an example of a grocery store, or an electronic store, you can go into the stores, there is lots of inventory and you can come out with bags full of your grocery. You do not order your grocery a week ahead of time and then go pick up the delivery. In fact, if you were to go into the grocery store which you want, it isn\u2019t there, you will go to another store and buy it.","So, world economies are largely run on inventory. Now, enter the tariff uncertainty, imagine a customer building the product in China and let\u2019s say there were no tariffs on it and bringing it to U.S. \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 they were tariffs on it, there is 25% tariff format. So, they bring the product to U.S. with 25% tariff on it and having then the uncertainty to be able to pass on that tariff to the end customer. They don\u2019t know whether they can or they can\u2019t. And the second risk is to bring the inventory to U.S. and then there is settlement announced. Once a settlement is announced, no end customer will pay the 25% tariff, because the manufacturer brought it here with tariff at their own risk. So, what it does is it makes everybody stop in their tracks. They cut down the inventory on the loading dock to the manufacturing lines, to the raw material, to the finished goods, to the transportation hubs everywhere, people draw down the inventory, because they do not know what the landed cost is and what they can pass to their customers. That is the impact we have seen in many, many of the market. And when there is the clarity on the tariff front, then you will see the rebuilding of that supply chain inventory, which would have a very positive effect on us.","Christopher Rolland","Got it. Thank you for that extra insight. Very helpful. Yeah, that\u2019s great. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019re going next with Gil Alexandre from the Darphil Associates. Please go ahead.","Gilbert Alexandre","Good evening. I assume as you look at your long term models that you still have gross margins at 63% and operating margins at 40.5%, once we get over these problems?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, Gil. We have not changed a longer term model. In fact, the changes we announced today on the restructuring of our Colorado fab and bringing some of those 6-inch products to our higher volume 8-inch fabs and really creating $65 million in savings and the process. What we have done is we have lowered the revenue at which we achieve our target model. So, prior to that, it required a certain amount of revenue to fill up our factories and remove the underutilization to achieve a 63% target margin. By making those changes we are not galvanized for you how much, but we have lowered the revenue we need to achieve to achieve the target margin because we\u2019re taking so much cost out of the system.","Gilbert Alexandre","Thank you. May I just ask one question on China and you can skip it.","Steve Sanghi","Go ahead.","Gilbert Alexandre","You talk of this 25% tariff. Have you seen any talk that they may \u2013 that people want to reduce that tariff or is that all open ended?","Steve Sanghi","You have some information you are sharing.","Ganesh Moorthy","Are you talking about the trade discussion between the U.S. and China? Because I think that is that the entire point is going to be, the 25% tariff is creating uncertainty on both sides of the ocean, is creating uncertainty in other regions of the world as well.","Steve Sanghi","In phase one settlement that has been touted by the administration, the 25% tariff doesn\u2019t go away. They only agreed to not increase the tariff from 25 to 30, but there is some talk whether it\u2019s in phase two or gets done in phase one with certain $100 billion worth of goods, the tariff will go down, but those are just talk so far?","Ganesh Moorthy","I think we see different news reports. We don\u2019t have any direct insight into the discussions and decisions. I think there is a, in good faith effort to try to deescalate from where we are, and it may take more than one phase, but the rate at which that comes down and the time when it impacts, the products that we are designed into, our customers are impacted by is unclear to us.","Even if there is a settlement, which creates a finality, the tariffs are not zero, tariffs are some number 10%, 15%, but they are constant and it\u2019s not going to be another tweet which is going to increase those tariffs. Once the customers, distributors, contract manufacturers, everybody has that finality and they can run the business in a normal way and the inventories will get replenished. It is the uncertainty which causes it because they don\u2019t know what the landed cost will be.","Gilbert Alexandre","I want to thank you. Good luck.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Gil. Anything else, Operator?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR.","Carlin Lynch","Hey guys, this is Carlin Lynch on for Craig. Just wanted to ask a question on the cross selling opportunities with Microsemi. I think last quarter, you had said that the muted environment had kind of slow down some of that progress. If we were to get to a normalized environment next year, could we see those cross selling opportunities kind of springboard? Is the design activity going on and or just seeing muted demand everywhere, or any kind of qualitative color you could give on the cross selling opportunities would be great?","Ganesh Moorthy","So, as you note, the cross selling opportunities are all at the design in stage. So, these are platforms that get designed and then go to production over 18, 24 months of time. The design in activity is going extremely well. And across the board, the combined sales teams, combined business unit teams of Microchip are all highly focused on enabling that a new design. The environment today is really for products of design back in time. And that muted environment doesn\u2019t change. But the seeds are being planted, new designs and the increased total system solutions were able to address are clearly will pay off in time as the current \u2013 as the new designs go to production in, 12, 18, 24 months of time.","Carlin Lynch","So, just if I could clarify there. So we would expect some of that cross selling opportunity to start to manifest next year, even if the demand environment kind of just skips along the bottom here?","Steve Sanghi","Yeah, and you got to take it over time, if this is not a single application, single customer that drives in one way or another. There\u2019s hundreds of applications customers over which this would happen. But clearly there is a multiplier that comes from cross selling from selling a more complete solution to the customer. And as that ramps in, I don\u2019t know if it is exactly first half of next year, second half, but in time, as the environment improves, these new designs go to production, we will see the benefits that come from it.","Carlin Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019re going next to Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Question for Steve. One of the secondary impacts of the trade war is just the acceleration of China to try to move to more of a localization effort. Can you talk about just maybe parts of your portfolio where you see maybe some overlap to that versus other parts that you think, a lot more immune to what China might be trying to do from a development perspective?","Steve Sanghi","So, we hear a lot of talk and we don\u2019t see a lot of action on that front. There may be action on certain product lines, I think they\u2019re really maybe trying to build processes and graphic processes and others, we do not really see that can impact today on our data center products, on our FPGA products, on our discrete and other products, our microcontroller analog, we hear a lot of talk about it. In longer term, there could be an issue where they want to either design their own product or not prefer to design with Americans. I think in a short period of time, less than a year of this trade war, you can\u2019t really design a massive portfolio that microchip has to make a meaningful impact on it. So, we really not seeing that on revenue today, but we seeing it in sentiment.","Ganesh Moorthy","And I would add to it, the threat from local suppliers in China is nothing new. It's been there for many years. It's a question of do they have the types of products, the quality of the product, the capability to support the designs, the wide range of applications and customers that you need to be able to serve with it. You know, that is a very large task. And they may be more environment today that says, you know, you should consider more of a local supplier, but the task is very, very large for anybody who wants to do it. And if they could, they would have been doing it for several years before.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We're going to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for the very quick follow-up. Actually I wonder those same lines in terms of competition and substitution. Steve, have you seen any design shifts to your \u2013 perhaps your European or Japanese competitors who have been in the market for a longer period of time? You know, does that become a factor going forward?","Steve Sanghi","You know, like I said, first we have a very, very broad customer base, we serve over 120,000 plus customers. So it's very, very hard to track. We're not seeing any preponderance of evidence to see there is any design shift. We're hitting in sentiment, the so called non-sentiment, you may have, you know, heard that kind of language where, you know, government is saying, you know, design with Chinese customers first, design with Taiwanese or Asian is second, you know, design with the Europeans third, and Americans the last. But you know, 95%, 97% of products we build at all proprietary nature with no pin compatible part available. So in a short period of time, we really haven't seen any of that shift.","The shift will first become visible at the design stage if it does, and I don't think we have strong evidence today that that's happening. We're not losing designs like crazy. Our funnel size is still very, very large. And we're able to leverage a lot of our more commodity like products with more advanced products, but the total system solution if they're on the same board.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","This cause for concern and we're watching and we are making the product better, finding other sales mechanisms to bundle it and all that. So negative sentiment in China is definitely there, but it's not really, you know, being seen in bookings and revenue dollars today.","Operator","Thank you. It appears that there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I want to thank everyone. This has been a difficult year with all the uncertainty. Please continue to bear with us and we'll see some of you on the road as we go to various conferences. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now go ahead and disconnect."],"15025":["Microchip Technology, Inc.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bjornholt","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer.","We recently went through a comment letter process with the SEC regarding our non-GAAP reporting. As a result of this process, we will now be referring to what we used to call non-GAAP revenue as a metric called end-market demand and we'll provide this metric in our earnings release each quarter. End-market demand is the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct customers to non-distributors and buyer distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand by our distributors based on information that our distributors provide to us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net of transaction value of these shipments.","We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end-market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on end-market demand. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand.","So even though we are changing our guidance practice going forward, for transition purposes, today, we will provide a review of our Q3 results compared to our non-GAAP guidance provided on November 7, 2018, using our historical non-GAAP nomenclature. Our guidance going forward will reflect the outcome of the SEC comment letter process, which Steve will also comment on during his remarks about our guidance for the March 2019 quarter.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis using end-market demand metric as expenses and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","End-market demand in the December quarter was $1.416 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $1.4 billion, and down 6.4% sequentially from end-market demand of $1.513 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our end-market demand and GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%, operating expenses were 24.8% of end-market demand and operating income was $530 million and 37.4% of end-market demand. Non-GAAP net income was $405.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.66 and was $0.095 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.565.","On a GAAP basis, net sales in the December quarter were $1.375 billion, GAAP gross margins were 56.7% and include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation, $74.3 million of acquired inventory valuation cost and $23.8 million impact from the differences in GAAP revenue and end-market demand. All operating expenses were $584.9 million and include acquisition and intangible amortization of $193.7 million, special income of $1.3 million, $5.4 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $36 million. The GAAP net income was $49.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share and includes onetime tax expense of $0.4 million related to a variety of matters, including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements, statute limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinement and fiscal 2018 tax provision to tax return adjustments.","The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the December quarter and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal year 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to be 5% or less, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The cash tax payments associated with the transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi group is expected to be about $293 million and will be paid over eight years. We have a posted schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the current quarter for a variety of reasons discussed earlier.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2018 was $702.5 million. All of the inventory markup from Microsemi required for GAAP post-accounting has now been sold through and is no longer reflected in the ending inventory balance. We had 123 days of inventory at the end of December quarter, up six days from the prior quarter's levels. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 36 days compared to 37 days at the end of September. We believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end-market demand.","The cash flow from operating activities was $481.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $436.2 million. We paid down $377.5 million of total debt in the December quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $349.4 million. At December 31, our debt outstanding includes $2.743 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $2.713 billion of term loan B, $2 billion on high grade bonds and $4.481 billion of convertible debt.","Our net debt-to-EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.8 at December 31. Our net leverage metrics are based on a 12-month trailing EBITDA which will continue to provide some headwinds due to significant distribution inventory reductions that were made in the June and September quarter for Microsemi, which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end-market demand during these periods. The weak economic environment also has negatively impacted our EBITDA in the December 2018 quarter and will continue to do so in the March 2019 quarter.","We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $86.3 million.","Capital expenditures were $27.4 million in the December quarter. We expect about $45 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $235 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced to Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47 million.","I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I would be sharing with you are based on an end-market demand metric, which is how Microchip measures this performance internally. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 8.7% compared to the September quarter, reflecting a broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. Microcontrollers, however, were up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Microcontrollers represented 52.9% of our revenue in the December quarter.","During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, ranging from the industry's lowest power LoRa System-in-Package family; the single-chip maXTouch touchscreen controllers for screens up to 20 inches in size; to Intelligent Network Interface Controller technology, the industry's most efficient automotive infotainment networking solution that supports all data types, including audio, video, control and Ethernet over a single cable.","In my prepared remark last quarter, I mentioned that our microcontroller business was annualizing at over $3 billion in end-market revenue. Through our subsequent investor meetings, there seemed to be the perception that our 32-bit microcontroller business was not very big. To address this perception gap, we'd like to share with you that over the last two quarters, our 32-bit microcontroller business is annualizing at over $1.2 billion in end-market revenue. The 2018 microcontroller rankings from Gartner are normally available in April and, as we have seen in prior years' results, we expect to see significant market share gains again. We will report on these results during our next conference call.","Now moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 6.2% compared to the September quarter, reflecting the same broad macro weakness our microcontroller business experienced. Analog, however, was up 77.9% from the year-ago quarter. Analog represented 29.1% of our revenue in the December quarter. And during the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products as well, including the industry's smallest multi-output MEMS clock generator, the industry's smallest five channel temperature sensor and the most robust silicon carbide diodes and MOSFETs in the industry.","Our FPGA revenue hit another all-time record even after going back to the Microsemi and Actel history with 8.7% sequential growth compared to the September quarter. Our low-power, midrange PolarFire family continues to go on a -- garner strong market acceptance, while the prior generations continues to demonstrate consistent growth even in the current market environment. We also unveiled the industry's first RISC-V system on a chip FPGA architecture, combining the industry's lowest power midrange PolarFire FPGA family with a complete microprocessor subsystem based on the open, royalty-free RISC-V instruction set architecture. FPGA represented 7% of our revenue in the December quarter.","Next, moving to our licensing business. This business is sequentially up 7.9% as compared to the September quarter. Our results reflect the sale of another type of license for a specific set of patents that can be used in noncompetitive fields of use. We anticipate that this patent license to close in the December quarter and include it in our guidance.","We continue to retain indefinite rights to these patents for the field of use that are of interest to us. Our patent licensing strategy is to monetize portions of the substantial patent portfolio we inherited through our acquisitions by licensing select patents to players in noncompetitive fields of use. In all cases, we retain rights to use these patents in our products as well.","We had meaningful patent license transactions in September and December quarters. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We do not expect meaningful contribution from the patent licensing in the March quarter.","Our memory business was sequentially down 15% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. And finally, our multimarket and other business was down 3% sequentially compared to the September quarter. A quick update about the Microsemi integration. Business units, sales, operations and support groups are all making rapid progress. Our thanks and kudos go out to the combined company employees who are working hand-in-hand to achieve the accelerated synergy results. Overall, we are ahead of our synergy targets and expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. What will take us the longest is the business systems and operations integration, which is being done in phases. The first phase is where one of the business units went live on November 1, 2018. The second phase just went live on February 1 and involved three more business units, and more phase releases are planned with a steady cadence. We expect the overall business and operational integration will take about 15 to 18 more months to complete.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Stephen Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2019. I will then provide update on our progress at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Our December quarter non-GAAP financial results based on end-market demand exceeded our guidance for net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit -- operating margin percentage and earnings per share. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin reached an all-time record at 62.2% of net sales and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 100 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 37.4% of sales and exceeded the midpoint of guidance by about 130 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.095 per share. We are pleased with the financial results despite a very unfavorable business environment with the tariffs, slowdown in China, the European automotive issues, higher interest rates and under absorption charges from some of our factories.","Let me also touch on the performance of Microsemi. Microsemi's non-GAAP operating profit reached a record. We are systematically improving Microsemi's financial performance and realizing significant synergies. At the time of our announcement of Microsemi acquisition, we had guided to $0.75 accretion run rate after the first year. After nearly seven months, we are well ahead of the $0.75 run rate for accretion from Microsemi. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 113th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all employees of Microchip, including employees from our acquisitions, for their contribution.","Now, let me provide you some further update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First, distribution inventory. After reducing the inventory and distribution channel in the September quarter, Microsemi distribution inventory remained stable at 2.6 months in the December quarter. We believe that at the current levels, distribution is holding the amount of inventory it needs to support the end-market demand. In last quarter's earnings conference call, we discussed moving several Microsemi customers back to being serviced directly that Microsemi had transferred to distribution. We completed this transition during the December quarter.","Microsemi internal inventory. Microsemi's internal inventories are still high as we continue to maintain lower loadings in Microsemi's internal factories as well as subcontractors until the inventory comes in line. As we said from the beginning, Microsemi has very good engineering teams and very good products. The customers' pockets are sticky and we continue to believe there are very good end-market opportunities for the combined company.","Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we started with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With distributor and contract manufacturing inventories reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi. So far, we are ahead of our original target.","Now, regarding guidance going forward. Beginning with this March quarter, as Eric mentioned, we are changing the information included in our financial guidance in response to comments and discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the GAAP standard change to sell-in revenue recognition, we continued to provide guidance and track our results based on sell-through revenue recognition and refer to the sell-through revenue as non-GAAP net sales.","After the adoption of ASC 606, the feedback we received from investors and sell-side analysts had been very positive on a continuing use of sell-through revenue recognition in our reporting of non-GAAP net sales. We continue to strongly believe that managing our business on a sell-through basis is the appropriate way to run Microchip. Therefore, we will have preferred to continue to use our end-market demand as our non-GAAP sales. However, after receiving an SEC comment letter and discussing with the SEC, we have decided to provide net sales, sales guidance based on sell-in revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard. We will continue to provide non-GAAP guidance for gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share, but we will use sell-in days GAAP revenue for these calculations. When we report our results, we will also provide information on end-market demand so that investors can understand the consumption of our product in the marketplace, but we will not use the end-market demand for calculation of the non-GAAP P&L.","Now, I will provide you guidance for the March quarter. The guidance we provided for the September and December quarters, which reflected our caution on business conditions, turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the March quarter. We see a very uncertain business environment with tariffs, slowdown in China, European automotive issues, higher interest rates potentially causing U.S. GDP to slow down, any lingering effect of U.S. government shutdown and potential for further U.S. government shutdown.","With all this commentary, we expect our total GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition for March quarter to be up 2% to down 9% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.2% and 61.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.8% and 26.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 34.7% and 36% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.26 per share to $1.53 per share. Again, all these ranges for non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share are based on GAAP revenue and sell-in revenue recognition.","We also want to give the investors and analysts a sense of how we see the Microchip business past the March quarter. As you know, there's a substantial pending date of March 1, 2019 when, if there is no settlement between U.S. and China, a 25% tariff would kick in for about $200 billion of Chinese goods shipped into U.S. We think that the two governments will make some progress, but it is likely that the data from March 1, 2019 will be extended further out.","Barring any material negative development on the trade front, we see the March 2019 quarter to mark the bottom of the cycle for Microchip. We cannot yet say what the shape of the recovery would be, whether the recovery be V-shaped, U-shaped or L-shaped. That will depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks. What we do see a bottom forming and believe that the March quarter will mark the bottom for this cycle for Microchip.","Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go now to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","I appreciate the color around kind of tariffs and how you're thinking about things kind of post-March. Just any signals that you're looking at in terms of calling the bottom here, whether it's kind of run rate of business, inventory distribution or customers? Just how you're seeing kind of the business overall kind of beyond the March quarter?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we look at a variety of factors, including bookings and billings activity, discussion with our direct and distribution customers, distribution sell-through activity, customer cancellations, customer pull-ins, delivery push-outs and pull-ins. Whether 120,000 plus customers that we service in a vast range of end markets and applications, we really believe that we get a very broad perspective of what is happening in our business. Today, these indicators are telling us that the environment is still very uncertain driven by a variety of factors, including the trade situation. However, we don't see things getting worse at this point unless something more negative occurs on the trade front. Based on the vast amount of data that we get, we're releasing a framework for the formation of a bottom for this cycle in the March quarter.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about, so far this quarter to-date, kind of January to February, what type of linearity you're seeing and how the business has been?","Stephen Sanghi","So business is tracking well to the guidance we are providing. We have seen the bookings stabilize and even increase somewhat very recently, but I would say it's a very short duration indicator and it's really not enough for -- a long enough time to be really making calls based on that.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Steve, I was hoping, first, if you could give us about a sense, as you think about the March quarter, if you think sell-through will be above or below or similar to the sell-in revenue that you're giving guidance for?","James Bjornholt","Yes. So we are -- we do not really have a good process for forecasting what the change in distribution inventory is going to be. That's not how we used to run our business historically, you know that, and that's why we've given the sell-through information or end-market demand consumption historically. We really feel, as we said kind of in our prepared remarks, that distribution inventory is in a good position to support what end-market consumption is. So I think at this point in time, we've given a pretty broad range of guidance for the quarter of plus 2 to down 9, so that's probably the broadest range of guidance you've seen from Microchip in a long time and some of that is the unpredictability of what the sell-in versus sell-through is going to be.","Mark Delaney","That's helpful. And then my follow-up question on the completed quarter, revenue and gross margins were above your guidance. Can you just give us a better sense for what enabled the company to exceed its guidance on those financial metrics?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, do you want to take that, Eric?","James Bjornholt","Sure. So, I mean, revenue was roughly 1% -- a little more than 1% better than our guidance was. And I think that's just kind of the puts and takes that we saw in the quarter, but it was good that we came in above the midpoint. And then on the gross margin side, we had a very favorable product mix in the quarter. We continue to really focus on cost reductions of our manufacturing areas. You know that we made quite a bit of changes in terms of any discounts that were previously given for the Microsemi portion of the business, on sales to distributors or contract manufacturers, and we're really seeing the benefit reflect itself in the gross margin today.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava","Maybe just take stick to the gross margin side. Your guidance is, on a Q-over-Q, that's a pretty big delta, but yet your margins are coming in a much stronger than what I would have modeled it. Could you just help us understand the dynamics there in the guided two quarters, especially in light of your inventory came down as well? And I'm expecting you're not building inventory in the quarter. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Stephen Sanghi","Is your question that the gross margins are coming down, but the operating margins are not as much?","Ambrish Srivastava","No. My question is gross margin are -- gross margin is coming in stronger than what I would have modeled given your shortfall in the revenues versus what the street was expecting.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I think the same reason why the gross margins were strong this quarter. We are getting an uplift from a lot of the discounts that were given to the distribution channel and contract manufacturers and others. And a lot of the business of that was moved to distribution from the Microsemi business, we have completed that conversion back to direct and, therefore, you take out the distribution margin hit. So all that is having a positive effect on ASPs and our margins.","We are continuing to reduce cost in all of our factories. There is still a lot of Atmel products, which was outside. Every quarter, more and more of it is coming in. There is also some Microsemi product we're starting to bring in. Some of the expenses have been taken out from the manufacturing overhead in synergies. So we have a lot of moving parts and the product mix is very healthy.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. Good. And then my quick follow-up, Steve, usually things don't turn around that quickly. And it's a small piece of your business. FPGA, if my memory serves me correct, it was kind of in the $320 million, $325 million run rate annual, and you posted $100 million quarter. What's going on? Is there, hopefully not a last time buy, but some design wins that are ramping?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes. There are no last time buys in FPGA that are driving that revenue. There has been feed zone for many quarters on some of the new products, the fourth and fifth generation of the FPGA products. There's some of the FPGA, which is exposed to markets like defense and aerospace, they have some quarter-ending budget that needs to be spent. But it's a stable, solid business and we see many, many good characteristics for how that can be continued to be built on. Quarter-to-quarter, we may have small changes, but our overall, if you look at annualized revenue, it's on a nice good growth path for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","So Steve, can you give us some color by end market, whether it's industrial or autos or consumer or communications, where you are perhaps seeing better or worse trends than what the midpoint of your March outlook would suggest?","Stephen Sanghi","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes. Rather than going segment-by-segment, I think we have previously indicated that the automotive, industrial and consumer home appliance markets were weaker in the last quarter. Especially as we look at this in the guidance for this quarter, we're seeing the addition to that, the data center market, the communication markets have also started to have some softening that goes with it. So at this point in time, I can't pick any one of them to say this is the main reason why the strength is coming or the weakness is coming. I think we're seeing a broad-based weakness and even some which were stronger last quarter are less strong at this point in time. Defense and aerospace has continued to be strong. It could have some impact this quarter from the government shutdown and what impacts that may have, but that's all built into our guidance at this point.","Stephen Sanghi","I think aerospace and defense is a market in its own. It's in its own space and it doesn't really follow the usual -- what happens in industrial, consumer and other. It's a very different business. We did see some impact from the government shutdown where we couldn't get certain export licenses processed and some programs were not released, but we kind of expect it to square up in the quarter and that really help any significant impact going out of the quarter. There is some impact of a budget flush and there's a lot of budget flush in September and December quarters where all these large customers, they have government budgets and they need to spend it. Otherwise, they use it or lose it. And so March quarter is sequentially down in that segment because of the budget flush.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And for my follow-up, Steve, if we, let's say, do have a trade resolution in the next few weeks, do you think there is a potential for an inventory refill? Or do you think the industry is shipping to consumption right now, so we should not be modeling any better than seasonal quarters going forward?","Stephen Sanghi","I don't know about how everybody else is doing, so I will just speak for Microchip rather than the industry. A settlement of trade would be a bonanza. Our customers and distributors are so cautious. There is low visibility. They're building bare bones what they need for the backlog from their customers. Nobody wants to get stuck with anything depending on what happens. If the trade talks are settled prior to March 1, this would be a big bonanza.","James Bjornholt","Yes. Vivek, just to add to that, as you can tell from our last two quarters of actual results where our end-market demand was higher than what the sell-in revenue was, there's definitely a bleed-down of the distribution inventory and we don't think that the end customer is probably any different, although we don't get real data points on that.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes. So we are not shipping to consumption as you said. We're shipping well below consumption.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","I guess, Eric, you said in your prepared comments, you made the comment that the guide for the March quarter on the revenue is wider than normal. Can you help me understand, to what extent is that just a reflection of how uncertain this environment is and to what extent is that just a reflection of having now to guide just sort of a sell-in revenue? And as we think about future quarters, is this now the right range of guidance around the midpoint you're going to give us or is this just wider because of uncertainty?","James Bjornholt","I believe it is the combination of both, right? I mean, we haven't given guidance historically based on sell-ins. So this is new to Microchip and we don't feel that we have a good way to understand if distribution inventory is going to increase or decrease in a period. So that is a factor, but obviously the environment is very uncertain. So I can't parse it out in terms of what percentage is each, but I -- this is just a pretty broad range of guidance...","Stephen Sanghi","Yes. So I think -- I would just say, maybe sticking my neck out a little bit, that over time, I think we will learn to have the guidance narrower. We have a very broad distribution. We do business with over 100 distributors around the world, which is not the case with many other semiconductor players that do business with largely 3 or 4 large distributors. We, as you know in the past, we have large distributors, which we call global distributors, we have catalog houses and we have nearly 80 to 100 distributors in China alone. So our distribution network is very, very broad. And to really figure out what everybody is going to buy, those are not the profits that we worked on in the past. We don't really care what distributor buys. We care about what distributor sells out and our processes take care of that. So we will get better at it very rapidly. We're not saying years. We're saying quarters. We'll get better at it and guidance will narrow. And the other impact is the uncertain environment. Once the environment gets more certain, I think we'll narrow it also.","James Bjornholt","Yes, and I think another contributor factor is that the lead times are very, very short today, right? So backlog visibility is not great.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. Then maybe for my follow-up, guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin, a couple of other questions were asked around that. I'm just kind of curious, given that, Steve, you mentioned you're undershipping demand today. In conjunction with sort of the slowdown at the industry level, you were also working through some excesses that the Microsemi business had when you bought it. I'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about utilization now? Have you done all the utilization adjustments you needed to? And I guess, more importantly, as business comes back and you benefit from increasing utilization and some of the more in-sourcing activities you're doing, how do we think about kind of that long-term target gross margin? Because relative to that 63% you've talked about, you're not too far away in what's a really rather lackluster business environment. Is 63% the right margin to think about or could it be higher?","Stephen Sanghi","Good question, as always. Just to keep that question on the back of your mind, and I think as we get further, as we establish 63%, then we will assess further. Right now, especially Microsemi factories are significantly underloaded because we first corrected the distribution inventory, and then the internal inventories were much higher, the internal inventories from Microsemi that we inherited are a lot higher than really the level of inventory at Microchip. So we have a number of factories running at 50% capacity, a number of them are running something higher than that. So overall utilization is very low. But, I made this point last quarter, I think only about 10% to 20% of -- 15% of Microsemi business is done in the internal factories, that comes from the foundries. So from foundries, we have aggressively cut the starts and assembly and test loading to really bring that down rapidly at subcontractors. Internal, we have carried and the factories are running below capacity. And when the business comes back, we get some improvement from utilization from the internal factories but there were only 15% of Microsemi business, they're only probably 5% of our business, total, Microchip. So just be careful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","One for Steve and one for Eric. Steve, I wanted to ask about your comment about marking the bottom in March, a couple of other broad companies have said the same thing. But they are usually talking about either some sort of stabilization in the backlog or some kind of metric that they are watch and monitoring. I'm also -- when you make that statement, I'm also hearing sort of, Ganesh, in response to a question said, things are still getting worse in some of the markets. So I'm curious if you have any kind of tangible data in terms of either backlog or orders or something else you could point to. And do you think the China industry is sort of flushed at this point in time and that's we're basically shipping to true demand or maybe undershipping and that's the reason why you feel better about it? And then I've got a follow-up for Eric.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I would say some of the data center and other business you're talking about, they're also down somewhat seasonally and they're weaker seasonally because March quarter is weaker compared to September and December quarters in which year-end shipments happen. But I think the question you're really asking is, what gives us the confidence that the March market will mark the bottom, is that the question?","Harsh Kumar","Yes, yes.","Stephen Sanghi","Okay. So I think I would say we really can't present you enough data to convince you and we're not going to try. What we can tell you is that our current backlog for June quarter is about flat with the backlog we had for the March quarter on November 5, okay? So that may look flat. But then you have to look at after November 5, we had a bunch of holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas and then Chinese New Year in the March quarter. There are no major holidays for June quarter. So starting with the flat backlog and going into the stronger quarters without the holidays, that's why we say barring any significantly negative developments on the trade negotiations with China, we believe that June quarter will strengthen or we're confident that it should not be sequentially down again. But the second point I would say, Harsh, is, and I don't mean this for all the analysts and for all the investors, there are lots of them that have followed us for a long time and believe the calls we make, but there are a lot of the others who don't. ","We have made numerous calls in the last 15 years or so for the business environment to turn negative and then turn positive. When we first make a negative call, first it is not believed, it's even ridiculed a few times. Then 3 to 4 months later, what we say gets confirmed and everybody goes down. Then comes the recovery part of the call, it is not believed either. As we go on the road over and over and over we get the question, what gives you the confidence, and we answer it. That is not believed either. So to my recollection, we have not been wrong in 15-plus years in calling the downturn, and we have not been wrong in the same time frame calling the upturn. That's what gives us the confidence. Like you saying your business, past performance is no guarantee of the future results. So we don't guarantee anything. So of course, our confidence is subject to some number of risks, but I think that's the narrative I'd like to explain.","Harsh Kumar","No, that's very helpful actually. And then question for Eric was, how much free cash flow do you expect by your calculation to be available for debt payment in March? And if that's the base level number and we expect business to get kind of better so we can get an idea of what you're kind of going to be able to do hopefully going forward if nothing macro changes?","James Bjornholt","Sure. We expect somewhere between a $175 million and $200 million of debt pay down in the current quarter. The last two quarters were significantly higher than that. I would say that we obviously are coming off where accounts receivable is down quarter-over-quarter. We had some very good help from some of our customers and some of our vendors in terms of payment terms and negotiating that, and really making significant progress compared to what our guidance was in the December quarter, but we don't really have those levers to pull in the current quarter. So I don't think I'd use that $175 million to $200 million as kind of an ongoing run rate. We do expect that it will get significantly better from this point forward, but we'll continue focus really all of our excess cash generation outside of the dividend on paying down debt.","Operator","We'll go to William Stein with SunTrust for our next question.","William Stein","Steve, I'd like to maybe take a different approach to the sort of cycle and recovery question. Acknowledging that you've tended to call these turns early and correct, I just want to understand what's giving you the confidence -- from the perspective of trade, we have this March 1 deadline hanging over us, and it sounds like you're providing us with some, not guidance, but some sense of demand post-March quarter that implies this gets resolved constructively. And I'm just wondering why you feel confident to do that? And then I have a follow-up, please.","Stephen Sanghi","I don't know if that's what I'm saying. Actually, I'm saying very clearly that barring any significant negative developments from the trade front, that was the caveat in what I said. And what I also said was that I think with a month to go to March 1, I think the governments are making progress, there are positive signals coming out of the White House. You recall how negatively signals were coming out regarding Canada during one of the conferences, I think. And then all of a sudden, a week later it all came out good. So it's -- Trump had used that strategy in a way and then not those negative signals coming about China. So I think the progress must be good, but it's a lot of work to get done. And I'm simply saying, it's most likely that there's some positive announcement but the actual settlement gets pushed out further. The settlement gets pushed out further, the environment we're seeing remains. Our guidance assumes a fairly current environment continuing. And if that current environment continues, then June quarter is still better than March quarter.","William Stein","Okay. One other question on the Microsemi integration. I know that -- I recall they acquired Vectron, a lower-margin business right before you acquired the whole company, and that was a -- they had never reported a quarter with that asset. And there were some other things in their portfolio that might not have met Microchip's, I don't know, view of a great business to be in. I'm wondering if you've made any portfolio adjustments, if you've closed any of their businesses so that we can think about maybe a different margin profile or growth profile when demand normalizes and all the inventory adjustments are made?","Stephen Sanghi","We have not. We have not sold any of the businesses, we have not closed any other of the Vectron factories. We're running the business. You are correct that the business is at a lower gross margin. We're using our usual techniques. We are trying to improve the gross margins. We asked the management, they also -- Microsemi had to cut some expenses, and we have cut some. So the contribution to EBITDA is actually much higher than really what it was originally. But the gross margin, if you only focus on that, then the gross margins are lower. We have other businesses at Microchip where the gross margins are lower than our corporate margin. We have also many businesses that are higher, in the 70s and 80s. So at the end of the day, it's a mix.","Ganesh Moorthy","If your question goes beyond Vectron. In the last two conference calls, we've also mentioned as part of our integration effort, we have reviewed every single business. And while there are many, many excellent businesses, there were some that needed improvement. And we have made adjustments in terms of level of investment we're making in those businesses to be better overall result for us as well. So -- but that's all largely behind us. At this point, as Steve mentioned, on Vectron and all the other businesses, we're working on improving what we inherited and making significant progress towards that.","Stephen Sanghi","And when the factories come back to full production, as we take out these excess inventories, Vectron business will see substantial cost reduction through higher utilization in that factories, their numbers are going to start looking much better.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","Just wanted to ask a question about revenue geographically. And I guess that we probably anticipate some of the weakness that you've seen in Asia that you talked about before. It look liked from the results that you saw a downtick in Europe also. Can you talk about that? And if there's anything specific geographically you're anticipating as you go into the March quarter?","James Bjornholt","I can take that. So I mean, the in all geographies, we're down. We posted this on our website. So it's available for everybody to see and will be in our 10-Q filing. But all geographies were down. It is not unusual at all for the Americas and Europe to be down in the December quarter just because of all the holidays. And typically, we see strength from Asia in that time period prior to leading in the Chinese New Year in the current quarter. But I think all geographies were weak. This weakness was not just the China issue, it's just kind of spread across the globe. And in terms of forecast for the next quarter or the current quarter that we're in, we don't really break out the forecast by product line or geography.","Stephen Sanghi","But I think directionally, March quarter, usually, our European business is strong, our China business is weak because of Chinese New Year, even in a normal time, we're also dealing with trade here, and the U.S. business is kind of normal. So I think directionally, it can have that.","Christopher Caso","Okay. And just as a follow-up, the follow-up question's on revenue of linearity through the quarter and kind of expectations for March as well. And you mentioned last quarter that you saw a slight uptick, I guess, in the first month of the quarter. I presume that downtick towards the end of the quarter. And then how do typically see linearity as you go through the March quarter again taking in consideration the Chinese New Year holiday in the middle?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, so I think the uptick we talked about in bookings in November call basically did not hold. I think you've heard from everybody that December was fairly weak. That's always the problem in making decisions based on very short-term data. And I said that earlier that our bookings have normalized very -- lately, we have even seen some strength. But don't take it to the bank yet, I'm not taking it to the bank. We have made the call today, at the midpoint down about 3.5% sequentially from GAAP-to-GAAP revenue. This does not include any dramatic improvement of bookings or improvement of trade or anything like that. I think it just assumes that the market stays in the doldrum.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","In terms of executing on the March quarter guide and maybe providing the team with a bit more confidence on the June quarter kind of qualitative outlook, historically, how much hinges upon the replenishment rates post-Chinese New Year? And when do typically get these signals? Is it two weeks, three weeks after Chinese New Year?","Stephen Sanghi","So March quarter sometimes lands up very much depending on where that Chinese New Year falls based on the lunar calendar. Earlier the Chinese New Year, the better than March quarter usually lands up being because Chinese customers can go slow before that and they come back and then they see all charged up and ramp up their factories. So Chinese New Year is happening this week, which we will consider kind of early because it can be late February, it can even be fairly late. But it has been even earlier sometime in late January. But this is really early to mid. So this is good sign, and we will see what happens after Chinese New Year.","Harlan Sur","Okay. No, I appreciate the insights there. I know you guys are waiting for the Gartner data, but just looking at the recent SIA data, the MCU segment was down about 4% sequentially in Q4 versus your MCBU business, which was down about 9% sequentially. I know you guys look at this data as well. Any reason for the big delta? Is it sell-in versus sell-through so not a fair comparison?","Ganesh Moorthy","I think in any given quarter, you're going to find that the data is more noisy. It's easier to look at these on a four quarter rolling basis, and that's what we expect when we'll see the 2018 data. So there is no doubt in our mind we're gaining market share. But quarter-to-quarter, the numbers can be more noisy.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gil Alexandre with Darphil.","Gilbert Alexandre","From all that say, it seems that your 300 synergies is pretty good number looking for fiscal '21 or '22.","Stephen Sanghi","So what I would say to that is we are ahead of the accretion target today. Just in some cases, we have pulled some of the synergies in, it had gone better in term of integration but we haven't revised the final number. The other major change that happened is that business environment recession that we're going through that we have not built into the forecast, nobody had anticipated it back then. It will depend on the shape of the recovery. If the recovery is fast like it has happened in some prior cycles, then we get back on that schedule. If the recovery is a lot slower and it's kind of the L-shaped recovery, it stays in doldrums for a year, then the schedule for achieving that may have to be adjusted. But I don't think we are uncomfortable with the number, total accretion.","Gilbert Alexandre","So it really means that you get $8 non-GAAP earnings in fiscal '21 or '22, or you could?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, you're putting words in my mouth. But that was our forecast then. And again, depending on the shape of the recovery, that is still our target.","Gilbert Alexandre","Okay. And your long-term model targets stays the same as you made in March of 2018?","Stephen Sanghi","Correct. I think state them again for everybody?","James Bjornholt","So it is 63% gross margin, 22.5% operating expenses and 40.5% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes, thank you.","Gilbert Alexandre","And do I need to be concerned that autos represent 17% of your mix?","Stephen Sanghi","Autos has been a very good business and you shouldn't be concerned. We have just a tremendous funnel of the design wins in automotive for future and all that, significant entry into various electric vehicles around the world and autonomous vehicles around the world. So there's really no reason to be concerned. The issue in automotive market have been two. One is, Europe implemented a new emission standard for their diesel vehicle starting September 1. And all the agencies had a one year notice, they knew a year ahead of time, that the new emission standard was going to effect on September 1, 2018. September 1, 2018, came and there was no capacity. People kind of just felt sleep on the switch. So there were millions of cars taking away airport parking lots that can't be on the road because they don't pass emission standard. So that created a significant dislocation in the European car market, it's working through it, will take more time to work through all that. So that was one issue. And the second issue was the slowdown in China. China is now the largest automotive market, larger than U.S. and larger than Europe. And China is going through its own issues of slowdown and stock market crash and some of the people's wealth has been affected. So the China automotive market, all that will come back.","Ganesh Moorthy","And Gil, if I can add one more point. The consumption of electronics going into cars continues to go up year after year after year. So -- and in many years, that consumption of electronics going up offsets any reduction in production as well. And so that's been the long-term trend and remain so.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Maybe just on the 32-bit micro traction that you're seeing. Can you just say what end markets it is? Maybe -- your discussion around automotive, maybe that plays into it. But can you say which end markets you're gaining the traction?","Ganesh Moorthy","We're broadly represented in the 32-bit microcontroller market. The standard products are broadly represented in all the end markets, it's a ubiquitous product. I can't pick any one of them that's necessarily the one that's going there. But we've been coming off of a -- a being lower in the rankings. We're rapidly coming up the rankings. And as we do that, it has to come from all the different segments that we play in.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Maybe is there such a thing as an upgrade from the -- your 8 and 16-bit customers going to 32? Is that helping your traction?","Ganesh Moorthy","No, not at all. I think, the 8 and 16 bits are continuing to do well. And again, when you see the annual results for 2018, you'll see that all three segments as it was in prior years are doing well. The 32-bit, we have more capabilities that have come both organically as well as through the acquisitions. It's allowing us to play in a number of incremental markets that perhaps we couldn't get to a few years ago. And so I think the point of providing some color was there was a sense of perhaps 32-bit was still very small for us and we were just playing in 8 and 16s. Now 32-bit, at over $1.2 billion annualized based on the last two quarters, is a pretty significant portion of a $3 billion-plus annualized microcontroller market for us.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Susquehanna.","Christopher Rolland","Steve, so regardless of the SEC's opinion, this analyst supports you that the standard should be sell-through, for what it's worth. But in terms of a question, now that we're a few quarters into Microsemi, what has been the biggest positive surprise for you in terms of products and traction and demand for those products positively since you guys close?","Stephen Sanghi","So I would say that we confirm usually a lot of positives after we close the acquisition. We don't usually find new positives because the management's always, those are the positive that's been out, and they're selling their company, so they're really not hidden positives. We usually find some new negatives that we may not have known or may not have fully understood or may not have been fully explained as you have seen. But on the positive side, we don't get surprises but we get confirmation. And here, as I said, we got a very good confirmation, the products are very good, customer sockets are very sticky in discrete military products, in FPGA sockets, in a lot of the analog sockets, in timing business and data center businesses. They're very good businesses, they're good sticky sockets, very complex products as well as very simple discrete product. So it has a range of products and very, very good engineering teams, very, very good work done. And I think we have continuously said that we feel very good about it. Business fits very well with Microchip. We have truly enhanced the ASPs and gross margins by a methodology of discontinuing the -- some of the discounts and all that. We brought the inventories to the right levels. Internal inventory, we're still working through. As we revamp the factories, I think they will have some more positive effect. So all that is very good. I think we feel good about where we are.","Christopher Rolland","Great. And then on some of the PMCS products, whether it's optical or storage, given kind of the well-known storage slowdown trends that we've seen out there more broadly, and then some guys talking about a data center slowdown or hyperscale digestion out there, have you seen any of this at all? And have you seen that play into either optical or storage for you guys?","Ganesh Moorthy","I think, built into our guidance for this quarter, as I mentioned earlier, it does reflect that there is some weakness in those two segments in communications and data center. It's not different from what others have been talking about as well. And we are seeing that in the Microsemi products that play into those segments.","Stephen Sanghi","But I think I don't think anybody questions the strength of data center or communication market as a good market longer term. Any segment is going to go through inventory digestion and cycles. The question we were dealing with was, is Microsemi a good business? Is it the right direct acquisition? Is short-term cycle coming in? And having some hyperscale digestion for a quarter or two will not really factor into our decision. I think this will be a very good business long term.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Forgive me if this question was asked because I'm joining late, but I was wondering if you can make a distinction between any potential trade settlement or trade agreement versus the actual deceleration that's happening in the Chinese economy. So meaning, if there is some sort of trade settlement, what impact would that have in the business environment? Or is it just maybe taking one risk off the table but the reality is that the economy is slowing down dramatically and the trade agreement would really more have a sentiment improvement but nothing really changing in terms of actual business? Just wondering if you could -- or if you -- maybe if you could just elaborate on that.","Stephen Sanghi","So Raji, I think our assessment is that trade is the problem why Chinese economy is weakening so much. China has been the production center for the world. And as these trades came in, Chinese goods became more expensive and threaten to go more expensive, with $200 billion of Chinese goods getting 25% tariff, that's a $50 billion tax. So companies have moved production out of China to the extent they could, to the extend the product was running in two different factories and one was outside. But there is just not enough capacity outside of China to take all that outside. But there are lots of them in works. With the tariffs, Chinese stock market has taken a major hit. And Chinese consumers use the stock market as the cash machine to run their businesses and buy cars and buy stocks. So I think you cannot take the trade issue away from the Chinese economy. As the trade issue is settled, that is the boost that the Chinese economy will need. And then the people will have to think about do they stop taking factories outside of China or would the trade talk settle, all that effort stops. I can't know what would happen there. Is there a future risk? If there is complete removal of trade barriers, then I think nobody's want to do the work to move the factories outside. If the settlement happens where there's significant barrier on both sides, then all that will continue.","Rajvindra Gill","That's helpful. And along those same lines, do you think there will be some sort of fiscal stimulus in addition to the -- if there's a trade agreement but a fiscal stimulus coming out of the Chinese government?","Stephen Sanghi","I thought there already was one.","Ganesh Moorthy","There are some small ones that have been done. But we don't have any inside knowledge of them.","Rajvindra Gill","Post New Year? Post-Chinese New Year?","Stephen Sanghi","I think there was one small one done. But I would think, yes, if there is a settlement in trade post-Chinese New Year, whenever Chinese economy has been weak, that's what they have done, stimulus for various things. That's largely predictable. And I don't know, I don't have a line to the Premier, but I think that's really what would happen.","Operator","We'll take our next Janet Ramkissoon from Quadra Capital.","Janet Ramkissoon","Just a question about China again. Have you -- could you comment on the business with ZTE in the quarter? Did you see a recovery there? And do you have any exposure specifically to Huawei?","Stephen Sanghi","So ZTE had no restrictions in the quarter and our business was normal. I think we said in the prior quarter, there was some demand distraction where during the time, ZTE couldn't build a product. They lost some designs and competitor picked it up. And in certain cases, we got design with a competitor also; in certain cases, we did not. But ZTE business is kind of normal. The Huawei business is normal. There is a lot of talk about the U.S. indictment and their CFO has been detained in Canada. There has been no impact of any of that on the Huawei business yet.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Steve, I wanted to go back to the issue of integration with Microsemi but approach it more qualitatively than quantitatively understanding that you're not changing any target at this point. So as we look at calendar 2019, can you just touch on what the key integration milestones are, objectives are, top 2 or 3, for sales items and channel management? And then the follow-up, I'll just hit it right now because it's similar. If we looked lower on the income statement at manufacturing and operating expenses, what would be some of the key issues you'd want to tackle this year in those areas as well?","Stephen Sanghi","We're moving forward on a very, very wide beachfront, so pick one. When we bought Microsemi, Microsemi compiled their results on 21 different ERP systems, business unit by business unit, and then they are compiled, somewhat like a conglomerate. We -- the companies we have bought, we have brought them all into our enterprise system and ran a single enterprise system for years and years. With Microsemi, we have said, we're going to go down to two systems. I would love to go down to one, but the work was just too much. So we were 22, one of us and 21 of Microsemi. From 22, we'll go down to two. And we're making progress. We took one business in into our system on November 1. We took three on February 1. We have another 3-or-so planned for May 1. And then there'll be a cadence of these go-live every quarter. In another 12 to 18 months, we will consolidate. So that's a huge project with lots of synergy and accretion coming from that. The business units in terms of the marketing and design and pipelines and integration with our technologies and factories and all that is largely some done, some ongoing.","Most of Microsemi parts are not going to come into our factories. Like PMC-Sierra parts, they run in foundries, and FPGA parts run in foundries, and they are going to come in inside. But certain products of other business units may come in, and that's an ongoing process. As far as sales is concerned, sales all work for a common sales leader. So that's already done. The biggest job in sales is cross-training and cross-pollinating. So a Microchip salesperson feel very confident selling Microsemi products, and in a total system solution gets all those designed in. And vice versa, a Microsemi person feels very confident with Microchip. With $4 billion company on one side, $2 billion company on other side, that takes some time. And that's progressing. And how we kind of make it work is really a -- is a team where you call on the expert from the Microchip side or the Microsemi side to make the joint call so you start to get your total system solution effect. And that, we're already getting. The reviews we see from various businesses in the Microsemi reviews, we see Microchip parts designed in, in the future boards and on the Microchip reviews, we see the Microsemi parts designed in. So that is starting to happen. But a lot more needs to happen.","Craig Ellis","That's helpful. And on the last point, Steve, is that something that will bear fruit from a revenue standpoint this year? Or does that just put you in a position where you've got the design win and then you work through what can often be a 12 to 18 month gestation period before that design would go to revenue?","Stephen Sanghi","It's the latter. The designs take about 9 months to 2 years to go to production depending on how complex it is. You could have a very simple, some discrete parts, et cetera, something that are designed in. There could be faster, but there are complicated parts which could be longer. So it's really, yes, there's a gestation period after you get the design in. You should see some revenue coming out of TSS in 2020, and then it accelerates from there.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we want to thank everyone for joining this call today. And we'll be seeing some of you between now and the next conference call. On the road, there are various conferences we'll be going to. So thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales in the December quarter were $994.2 million, modestly higher than the midpoint of our guidance and down 1.8% sequentially from net sales of $1.012 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range of 61.4% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at 22% of sales which was a record low and below the low end of our guidance range which was 22.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $391.7 million at 39.4% above the high end of our guidance of 39.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $341.2 million and was up 38.4% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.36 which was above the midpoint of our guidance.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were a record 61.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $361.8 million, and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $121 million, share-based compensation of $20.5 million, $1.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million.","GAAP net income was impacted by a $439.8 million discrete tax event in the quarter primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we also incurred a loss of $2.1 million on the retirement of our 2037 2.125% convertible bonds. After these adjustments, the GAAP net loss was $251.1 million or $1.07 per diluted share.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.5% in the December quarter, and we expect the rate to be about the same in the March quarter. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we expect about $300 million of taxes to be paid over the next eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore referred to as the transition tax. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $25 million in years one through five, $45 million in year six, $60 million in year seven and $75 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and these estimates may change as we complete our analysis.","We are working through the impact of recent U.S. tax reform on Microchip's longer term effective tax rate. There is no impact on the fiscal year 2018 rate as you can see from our March quarter guidance provided in today's earnings release. Excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be below 9%, which is what we are providing to investors and analysts for cash flow and operating model forecasting purposes. We will continue to refine this over the coming months prior to providing guidance for Q1 of fiscal year 2019.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at December 31, 2017, was $487.1 million. Microchip had 115 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 34 days and up 3 days from the prior quarter, and in the normal historical range for distribution inventory.","The cash flow from operating activities was a record $365 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash could be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost.","We bought back the remaining amount of our 2037, 2.125% convertible bonds in the December quarter through $58.3 million in cash. Capital expenditures were $66.4 million in the December 2017 quarter. We expect about $50 million to $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $210 million, which is at the lower end of the guidance that we provided last quarter.","We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.","As mentioned last quarter, our capital spending in fiscal 2018 also reflects three new building projects we are constructing in Arizona, India and Germany, which will give us meaningful lease cost reductions and avoidance in the future, as well as allow us to cost effectively scale our future growth. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $32 million.","We also want to provide an update on the tax treatment of our dividends. In fiscal year 2017, our dividends paid to shareholders were treated as return of capital and we were expecting similar treatment in fiscal year 2018. The tax cuts and Jobs Act which passed in December 2017 has changed this outlook. Due to the U.S. taxation and fiscal year 2018 of our foreign earnings which were historically permanently invested offshore, Microchip is taxable in the U.S. in fiscal year 2018. As a result, dividends in the June September and December 2017 quarters are fully taxable to our shareholders, and dividends to be paid in March 2018 will be fully taxable to our shareholders. We believe the impact of U.S. tax reform on Microchip's U.S. taxable income in future periods will result in dividends being fully taxable to shareholders in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. We will continue to provide updates to shareholders on this topic in the future if facts and circumstances change.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slow December quarter with a sequential revenue decline of 1.8% and year-over-year growth of 12.8%, all organic growth as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters.","The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business performed well in the December quarter with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the September quarter.","On a year-over-year basis the December quarter Microcontroller revenue was up a very strong 18.9%. 8-bit Microcontroller revenue actually set a new record again, edging out the September quarter performance, while 16-bit and 32-bit revenue continue to have strong year-over-year performances.","Our Microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Microcontrollers represent a 66.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","Now moving to our Analog business. Our analog revenue was sequentially down 3.2% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. As we highlighted at our last conference call, our publicly reported analog results continue to see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy, as we reported last quarter, is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions.","The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely, and as they replace older products and new designs, our revenue classification for these new products have shifted from the analog product line to our Microcontroller product line. Transitioning to more sticky and higher margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in as some of the revenue growth shifts into our Microcontroller product line.","In the longer term, as the revenue from analog attached design wins continues to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will grow nicely. Our analog products represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","Moving next to our licensing business. This business was up 6.8% sequentially in the December quarter and up 15.5% on a year-over-year basis, setting a new record in the process. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes as they manifest in our results as the license processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come.","Finally, our memory business was sequentially down 7.6% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Our December quarter financial results were good. Our net sales were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, which itself was slightly better than five years of seasonality. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4% of sales was at the high end of our guidance.","Operating profit of 39.4% of sales made a new all-time record, and earnings per share of $1.36 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 per share. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and calendar year 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 109th consecutive profitable quarter.","Now I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our Microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. On top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. We have a robust design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working and increasing the organic growth of Microchip.","Based on SIA numbers, our Microcontroller market share in calendar 2017 was at a record 15.7%, up 220 bps from calendar 2016. To be fair, calendar year 2016 only had three quarters of Atmel, while 2017 had all four quarters of Atmel. So I calculated market share for three quarters of 2016 to three quarters of 2017, which will be April 1 to December 31 of both years. Based on that nine-month comparison, our market share gain was 91 bps higher than 2016. Also, our Microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit product lines.","Now let us go into the guidance for March quarter. Our inventories at Microchip at the end of December 2017 were 115 days, which is right at our target. We were able to get to this target a quarter or so ahead of what we were thinking. This is due to enormous progress we made on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times.","Our book-to-bill ratio has also continued to moderate from 1.11 in both March 2017 and June 2017 quarters, and then the book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in September 2017 quarter and 1.0 in December 2017 quarter. This moderation of book-to-bill reflects the improvements in lead times that we have seen or we have been able to achieve over the last several quarters.","As we have indicated before, our seasonality for any given quarter will change as we integrate acquisitions and end up with a new blended seasonality. The seasonality of the Atmel business is driven by a larger percentage of consumer-oriented business, which has a sharper decline in the March quarter. In fact, the historic Atmel seasonality in the March quarter over the five years prior to the acquisition was a 7.8% sequential decline when they were an independent company. Meanwhile, Microchip's historic seasonality in the March quarter in the five years prior to acquiring Atmel was a 2.75% sequential growth. The blended average March seasonality results in a minus 1% sequential decline.","You can also see the contribution from Atmel's consumer business in the stronger than seasonal blended results Microchip experienced in the June, September and December quarters of 2017. We will compare our March quarter guidance to this combined seasonality of new Microchip. So now let's go into the non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We expect total net sales in the March quarter to be down 3% to up 1% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at minus 1%, which is right at seasonality that I explained about.","In September quarter last year, our net sales were up 15.8% from a year ago quarter. In December quarter, our net sales were 12.8% from a year ago quarter. In March 2018 quarter, we are guiding the net sales to be up 9% from a year ago quarter, clearly demonstrating the soft landing scenario that we have been talking to the investors. Our total fiscal year 2018 sales ending March 31, 2018 with midpoint of the guidance is expected to be up 13.2% from fiscal year 2017 sales, beating most of our competitors for the same time window.","Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. Based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers, we expect gross margin for the March quarter to be between 61.3% and 61.7% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 38.9% and 39.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.39 per share.","I want to remind investors that our long-term financial model is a non-GAAP operating profit of 40% and you have seen that we are relentlessly marching towards this model. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll take our first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color in terms of book to bill and lead times. When you think through the March quarter seasonality with Atmel\/Microchip combined can you help us as you go toward June in terms of what you typically see for the June quarter?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, the June and September were stronger quarters for Atmel as well as for Microchip and you have seen pretty strong June and September quarters for the last couple of years since we have had Atmel in both quarters. And you've seen the December quarter slightly stronger than our historic seasonality as we just reported. And what their results is significant difference in the March quarter seasonality where Microchip was historically up for 2.5% to 2.75%, and Atmel was down a whopping 7.8%. And that's really when you combine it together, that's what results into a minus 1% seasonality.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe just a follow up for Eric. As you approach the target model and given the margin expansion you've seen, can you talk about just some of the initiatives this year and maybe on the intermediate term for both gross margins and op margins?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, I mean, on the gross margin front it's more of the same of what we've been talking about over the past year in terms of investing and the assembly and test and bringing more of that in-house, and we're making progress on that front. We've deployed a lot of capital over the last couple of quarters, we had more coming in this quarter as we talked about in my prepared remarks on the $50 million to $60 million of capital coming in. So that will continue to add to the gross margin improvement over time.","We've got good utilization in our wafer fabs and all those things are making our cost structure very favorable. At a midpoint of guidance here of about 61.5% gross margin, we've got about a 1% improvement to go to get to the target model, and we're confident that we're going to get there with all these initiatives that we have.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And same thing on the operating margin, we just reported 39.4%, and our long-term model is 40%. And we're fairly confident that most of that gross margin will fall through and we're going to be in that range.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Operator","We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if the inventory build is something that you had expected at the start of the quarter or if that occurred more as a result of perhaps orders not coming in with turn rates as fast as you might have expected when the quarter started?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So the inventory was pretty much right on target what we had guided to and what we achieved. The turns rate in December quarter was not soft. We beat the December quarter from the midpoint of our guidance so I don't think there was any issue in terms of our bookings in December quarter, which will have changed the inventory.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. And you can see from the guidance that we had on our release, we think we're going to continue to be within our inventory target range of 115 to 120 days in the quarter that we're in right now, so I think inventory is well managed.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That helps. One follow-up, if I can. You might have mentioned this, and I apologize if I missed it, but you've been talking about supply constraints on the Atmel portfolio, in particular in backend tests, and I think you've noted that you expected to be supply constrained there for \u2013 one time you said for the next year, maybe now we're at either six or nine months more. Any update on that relative to the capacity you've been adding. And I see the book-to-bill coming down and lead times coming down. Is that specifically related to the Atmel backend test? And any update there will be helpful. Thank you.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So Atmel had many business units. It was just not one business, it was microcontrollers and memory and defense and aerospace and RF and automotive and wireless and other businesses. We had broad based challenges on the Atmel business, and every quarter certain products, certain business units get help you on that. And we have been guiding from the very beginning that we expect this to take until about June of this year for it to \u2013 all business to get healthy and that really hasn't changed.","So as we speak right now, there is largely, I would say, one-and-a-half business units that are still having significant challenges. Most of the others are in the very tail end where a large amount of problems have been resolved. And this last one-and-a-half business unit largely chose the testing platforms to be the one that you cannot acquire any more of. These were very old testers of 1970, 1980 vintage that should have been obsoleted prior to the year 2000. And 20 years later they're still running, but they're not running, they're not running well. And the capacity on them is going down not up because every quarter you've got to take one of it down to use for spare parts because you cannot buy anymore, so therefore the capacity is decreasing not increasing.","So we are bringing that testing up on those products on more modern testers or microchip platforms, but that process is painful and then qualification of customers, many of those are automotive customers. So that is the process we've been going through for the last year-and-a-half, and I think during which we have grown the business, results have been great, lead times have been slowly coming down, but some of the remaining challenges remain and we think we need another five months to get it all behind.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for the details.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on a solid quarter. 9% growth is pretty impressive, Steve. I wanted to ask about your outlook for March. In those markets, your broad end markets, auto-industrial consumer, which one do you think is going to outperform, in your opinion, the most?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, if the question is just for the March quarter, the consumer, obviously, is the weakest.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sure.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Automotive should do very well. Industrial should do very well. In some markets you have kind of brand new budgets coming in, in the New Year. The only market that is soft which is driving a minus 1% guidance is because of the Atmel seasonality which is usually down almost 8%, and that is driven by some of the consumer markets. Everything else should be good.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And maybe I'll add to that on a geographic basis, this will be a strong quarter for Europe. It always is, just many more shipping days in the quarter without the holidays. Asia is the most challenged just because of the Chinese New Year, and Americas should do pretty well.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So Steve, as my follow-up, you guys always run the company for the long-term, and historically in lean times even you've grown inventories, your target level of inventory is 115 to 120 days. You just hit 115 days now. By all metrics, end markets are still pretty good. Does it actually make sense for you to \u2013 can you make the case that you should actually be growing your inventory levels even further and beyond the 115 days? So why stop here?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, if our inventories get below 100, then we don't have usually all the right product in the right place and all the permutations and combinations and SKUs and permutations and combinations and SKUs and flavors available, and then you go on support and you're expediting and you're going to have a lot of manufacturing challenges. When you are in the 115, 120 days of inventories and I think we can manage our business reasonably well. I mean, I wouldn't distinguish between 115, 120 or a few days left or a few days even more than that on the outer side. But we don't want to have \u2013 keep going, like you said, to have 135, 140, 150 days of inventory, because then you're not really making the right use of that inventory.","We don't need that much inventory and you have the opposite risk of obsolescence where certain products, customer changes are flavored. They want to use a different package and we packaged it in and we want to keep most of the inventory and die (00:30:23) inventory. And when you do that, then its dollar value doesn't grow as much versus if you put it in the finished goods.","So I think that's well-tried over the years, that's really the right kind of number. And when we are lower than that, we're trying to grow inventory, when we are higher than that we're trying to decrease inventory, and that's kind of still the right number.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. Thanks, guys, and congrats.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess to start if you could talk a little bit about where lead times are in general now? You're talking about them coming down. Would you consider them at normal levels now? And just following on from that, Steve, you had talked about the soft landing that you were trying to achieve. You've got lead times down now, you had the book to bill at 1, I mean, would you consider that with what you are seeing now, that soft landing is what we're seeing now or are there are more steps that need to be taken as you go into next year in order to achieve that?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So let me have Ganesh answer the lead time, then I'll pick up on your soft landing question.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So lead times are running \u2013 if I look at the December quarter in the 4-week to about 14-week window. So if you remember, we had \u2013 at the peak of this, we've had between 4 and 20 weeks and we have started out the capacity has come on board as we're able to get our manufacturing to respond. We've been bringing that down and we fully expect that it gets a little bit farther down in the March quarter, maybe closer to about 10, 11 weeks at the top end, and then gets down to between 4 and 8 weeks which is what we would consider to be normal on about 90% of our standard line items by the June quarter, right about on the same timeline we established about a couple of quarters ago.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So picking up on the soft landing scenario, I think I would say we've pretty much demonstrated it. We're on the tail end of it. So March quarter is right at seasonality combining Atmel and Microchip together. And if June quarter grows from here, June, September are stronger quarters, then we kind of just right went through soft landing and getting back to kind of seasonality and March quarter is up 9% year-over-year. And right in the upper end of that range that we had given you and over time it gets into the middle maybe or something around that. I mean, we're not minus 10%, we're not correcting like some of the people thought we will.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up on the analog business and some of your comments on that. And I think I understand what you're saying that there's growth in analog within the microcontroller market which is affecting what gets classified in the analog segment, but what does that mean going \u2013 well, I guess two questions. One is why are we seeing that now in that \u2013 are there particular product cycle transitions happening which would cause that to show up in the numbers now? And then what does that mean for the analog business going forward? Should we expect some flattening of the growth on the analog business over the next several quarters as that trend plays out?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So the transition we're going through is some of our analog business was connectivity business when it either got originally created or if it came to us from an acquisition, was largely all analog in its functionality and therefore classified as analog. As time went on, if you look at a customer's system, we then begin to see what are the other functions that are on that customer's system. And often there are microcontrollers that are there to be able to take advantage of that analog.","What we did some time back was create a new set of products which effectively combined the microcontroller and the analog into a single product. And as we go win new designs \u2013 and by the way, sometimes that microcontroller was ours, in other cases the microcontroller was somebody else's. But when you take a complete solution, which is a single chip which has the microcontroller and the analog, particularly in some of these smart connectivity solutions and there's a fair amount of software that we provide, the combined solution is a far more defensible, far higher margin and far more sticky business that we have. So it creates the right answer and we don't think ahead of time should we create products that fall into analog or fall into microcontroller. We're doing what we think we need to do to be able to grow, protect and have high profitability on the products we have. So that's one part of the headwind you're seeing, so to speak, by classifying it as microcontroller versus analog.","But the other side of the tailwind that is coming, and I think we will see it progress along is the standard analog products that we've had, as they get attached around our microcontroller, our new designs as we have talked about the total system solution and the whole Microchip 2.0 approach of going to market. The remaining analog products will, over time, get back some of that tailwind and have that growth. And there's a bit of cross-currents between some of the analog that is moving to microcontroller for the right reasons, and the new analog designs that will come in and give us growth. But in the long run, we fully expect that analog will be a part of the growth story for Microchip.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","By the way, if a pure analog company adds a microcontroller core to another complex product to improve performance or programmability or for any other reason, they would still call it an analog product. If exact same product existed in Maxim or Linear or Intercell or \u2013 they'll call it an analog product. But same product, if it has a microcontroller core, we put it in microcontrollers, so it's a classification difference. It doesn't change the value proposition. At the end, we have a better total solution for the customer, more sticky socket, higher ASP, higher margins and overall growing the revenue.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Sure. But just to be clear then, with that trend and the microcontroller growth on a year-on-year basis already up, as we model your analog business going forward, that trend should persist until, I guess, you said, you see that attach rate from the analog components start to rise. Is that the correct interpretation?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It's certainly, as Ganesh described, it has some headwind because of that. Because of that classification, it puts a little tailwind on the microcontroller, a little headwind on the analog. How it will manifest itself longer-term next quarter or the quarter after and all that, we don't really yet know. It's a new phenomenon. I mean, we manage the company in an overall growth and we don't really care where you put it.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's fair. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. First question relates to Atmel. Company did a fantastic job of improving the margin structure of Atmel and I had thought that maybe some of that margin improvement was adjusting which end markets are being targeted with the historical Atmel products, maybe more towards automotive and industrial. Can you just talk about to what extent that was a factor or is consumer still a pretty big part of the mix? And I asked just to better understand the comment around the Atmel seasonality in March versus the historical rates.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I mean, we have had Atmel for seven quarters. That's usually the \u2013 six quarters plus is the lead time to get a new product in production. So if you talk (00:38:44) a lot of this improvement has come from because we largely changed the flavor of which markets the products were sold, I think you miscalculated there. What we had said was Atmel had a focus on \u2013 what terminology we used, home runs, Eric?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Swinging for the fences.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Swinging for the fences. We had a focus on large account in consumer segment, swinging for the fences and some you win, some you lose, and gross margins are lower and all that. So we very largely changed the focus on where the future retention is. And true, it's automotive, it's industrial, in other areas and less on the consumer accounts. But it didn't change the existing flavor of those parts in the last several quarters till those designs were obsolete and the new designs we are focused on come to fruition.","So a large majority of the margin structure change has come from improvement of pricing, disciplined pricing, dramatic cost reduction in the fab, assembly test, bringing a lot of those parts inside, reducing a large portion of the expenses, just doing the whole job overall better and rationalizing R&D, rationalizing manufacturing. But you cannot change the flavor of the business regarding what segments of business is in seven quarters. You barely touch it in seven quarters.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up on capital allocation, the company had talked in previous quarters about potentially engaging in M&A now that the balance sheet has been improved. I'm curious for an update on how Microchip is thinking about that at this point, especially with the increased flexibility in your cash post the U.S. tax reform?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We are really not thinking any differently. Post U.S. tax reform, the cash becomes easily movable from offshore that really was not easily movable before because it was permanently invested offshore. But our priorities have not changed. We continue to believe our priorities are investing in M&A first, dividend second, and our stock buyback only opportunistically. So those have not changed.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, Steve. Just to talk about, I guess, the soft landing that we're all trying to engineer here. Can you give us a little more color on like specifically what would be the combined typical June seasonality for Microchip plus Atmel? And then could we be above or below that? I mean, I guess, how can we be sure that we've, I guess, landed yet in terms of the soft landing?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I don't have the number for June quarter. It's a good question. We should have thought about it. I don't have it off the cuff. But you have seen strong June quarters for the last two years, you've seen strong September quarters for the last two years, and then you have seen stronger than historical December quarters. March quarter is right at seasonality. So it's really \u2013 that's what I'm seeing where it has landed. Therefore, the June quarter is below seasonal. If that's your concern, we think the June quarter should be pretty good, June quarter should be strong.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then how would you compare this slowdown or return to normal or soft landing or whatever you want to call it, versus like prior slowdowns that you've seen? Maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of bookings, how your customers feel, how the (00:42:53) feel inventory?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I think when you look at cycles, no two cycles are really different. One, many of the prior cycles have crash landed, and this one certainly is not crash landing. We engineered a soft landing here. The other factor was in some of the prior cycles, some sort of second catalyst happened. In 2014, it was a dramatic slowdown in China that we saw at first, and four months later, everybody saw it in stocks' price significant selloff. In some prior cycles, they were driven by other factors, a tech burst in 2000 or whatever, we're going way back. I don't see any other second catalyst this time, it's just driven by getting a capacity in line, bringing the lead times down, going from a high book-to-bill ratio to a very moderating one book-to-bill ratio. I mean, at one book-to-bill ratio you can grow the business forever, just take incremental terms every quarter and the business can grow. And for 90% of our business life, the book-to-bill is around 1, right?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah, that's right.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. And that where it should be, that means the lead times are short, people can get their product. We still have some challenges on the Atmel side in about one-and-a-half business units like I talked about and those are built-in analyses, and that part of it we still need to soft land. But it's largely there, I think. I think it's right over the runway.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and Steve for giving us the numbers that really show the 10 percentage point difference between Atmel's first quarter calendar seasonality and what was Microchip to make sense of things. So what I wanted to do is shift over to margins and ask you about the target March model, because when I look at the business I see that with gross margins we're I think within a 100 basis points of target, with operating I think we're within 60 basis points. The team's done a spectacular job improving margins over time, and you've raised the targets multiple times, I believe. The question is as you get this close to targets, is there anything that you would see that test (00:45:42) the business would have a ceiling at those targets, or is there an opportunity to operate above those targets?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I think what we do not want to do is on any parameter when we are above the target, or in the case of operating expense where we are below the target, then we suck that in and make that as a new target and keep thinking that the other one has to go higher. And then the operating margin goes over 40%, and then we say, well, how high is the target. The peak can't be the target. The business will oscillate over good times and bad times and very strong environments and weaker environments. 40% is a long-term target. Can it temporarily in good times go over 40%? The answer is yes, but there'll be equal times when a business is in recession and software will be less than 40%.","So if you're really doing the math like you did, you're saying, well gross margin is about 100 basis points away from target and operating expenses already at target, wouldn't our operating margin go higher? Well, the answer to that is yes but that's not long-term, that's temporary. It might go there. But during huge growth we have had last year, fiscal year 2017 or 2018, we grew 13.7% or a number like that. During that same time, expenses do not keep up and you get on the lower end of the expenses. And when the business moderates sometime, then the expenses catch up a little bit because otherwise, you're not able to hire people enough in a very, very strong time.","So again, you've got to give it a flex. And as managers, we don't want to be in such a tight box that every little slack, you suck it in. And then we're in such a small box, then we're just missing point one here and point two there. So think of that way. On a pure math basis, can the operating margins go higher? Yes, temporarily. We're not willing to yet admit that the longer-term margins could be higher than 40%.","And the second piece of that is still the M&A strategy. I have never bought a business that makes 40% operating margin or 39.5% where we are. So whenever we buy a business, it's usually much lower, then you have to understand the flavor of its business, can we improve its growth? Can we improve its operating expense? Where does it go? And then a blended margin comes up, and usually most acquisitions result into a blended margin to be slightly lower. For example, Microchip's operating margins are still several hundred bps above the Atmel flavor of the business, so it's 39.5% total, but Microchip is well above 40% and Atmel is much lower than 40% and we're still improving it. And some of the Atmel may never get where Microchip is and we were quite honest from the beginning and say, we'll improve it substantially. We have gone from Atmel breakeven to in the mid-30%s, but it can't match mid-40%s where Microchip might be. And I'm just putting fat brackets here and not giving you where the breakdown is. So I don't know whether that helps, but don't keep making our box smaller and smaller, please, we need some room to operate.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It's also the balance of (00:49:36) and profitability. So we've got to make sure that the investments for growth are there so that it's not just profitability but without any growth.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Speaking of growth, Ganesh, I'm going to ask a question on a business I don't think I've ever called out on the quarterly call before, but you did note the very strong sequential performance of a licensing business, and underneath that you highlighted some of the recent agreements that have been made with foundry and the growth that's being driven off that. As we look at that strong sequential growth, what does that mean and what do the recent business signings mean for the performance of that business in the immediate term, and what kind of beneficial effect does that have on the company's margin structure?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I want to be clear that the improvement in the results are not from recent signings. Signings took place multiple years ago after which you have to go install the technology, qualify the technology, allow the technology to ramp, and then have that ramp generate royalty revenue. And royalty is the substantially larger portion of the revenue that we get from the licensing business. And that continues to layer in as by either foundry or IDM that we license it to by node that it is licensed, and it can also change based on how a given process node succeeds or doesn't succeed. So much like in our IC designs where you have to get those designs early and then work with the customer to realize the revenue, it can take 24 months, 36 months. Licensing has a similar kind of thing where what you're seeing in today's benefit are things we did one, two, three years ago. And we continue to have new licenses that we are getting signed off that will create future growth, and I think we expect licensing will contribute to the overall growth that Microchip has, and of course at a much higher level of profitability.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I would say though that on the effect of licensing on the margin, licensing is a $100 million business. So a $100 million business at a higher gross margin than Microchips overall, but Microchip is at a $4 billion dollar run rate roughly. It's just really a small needle mover. There are equal number of other various business units where certain products are much higher gross margins, certain other products are less gross margin, and the mix moves forward and sometimes one has a stronger growth, the other has strong growth. True, licensing business is accretive to the gross margin, but at $100 million or a $400 million, it doesn't dominate.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yeah, this is Adam Gonzales on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering how we should think about your CapEx moving into fiscal 2019 in the context of some of the views you've laid out on the demand environment in a relative supply-demand balance? Thanks.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So we haven't gone through our annual operating plan process for fiscal 2019 yet so we're not ready to give a number on that as it is. We have made significant investments as last year, we have goals to bring the assembly and tests that we do internally hire and that will require investment. But I don't think we're ready to give \u2013 provide the street with a number yet for next year's CapEx. Still going to be a small percentage of overall net sales.","Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And I guess just one quick follow-up. I know this is a bit nitpicky on the seasonality issue, but in the March quarter, you guys are down 1% quarter-on-quarter, what's different this year versus last year? I mean, you had Atmel for a full quarter then and sales over 2% sequentially, so just what was better than seasonal in March versus this year?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","That's kind of what threw everybody off. Last quarter was very noisy. The \u2013 not the last quarter, March quarter last year was very noisy. We had just gone go live on January 1. There were a bunch of orders that were pushed out into the quarter. There were just \u2013 there were a lot of moving parts and there was a large amount of delinquency we had carried in the prior quarter of December, some of it we were able to meet. We were new to that business. It was the first March quarter we had had. Atmel had also left a fair amount of pricing and all that on the table. We talked about it and we were seeing a significant impact of price increases we had done which matched some of the seasonality. There were just way too many moving parts.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Plus the environment was stronger in March last year.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, not that environment is weak now though, but it's certainly not as strong as a year ago. So I think that's what threw everybody else off. And...","Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.. Thanks very much.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think this time there's no such noise, and this is a true seasonality with Atmel.","Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Got it.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks. And congratulations on the quarter. Going to the Microchip 2.0 strategy of platforms, how is that affecting your pressure on ASPs. You had mentioned before, Steve, that industry consolidation, you're seeing less pressure, but is this helping maybe even lift ASPs?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I mean, the answer to that is yes. I mean, I don't know if the ASPs continuously go up, but we are severely resisting the pressure to give year-over-year declines in large majority of the cases we're succeeding and are able to hold our ASPs, plus as we add a microcontroller intelligence to analog, as we attach analog around microcontroller will be more input into the customer to have a total solution. In general, you can bundle and it's more sticky and it helps ASP. All that is happening. But I mean, semiconductor ASPs do not constantly go up. I think if you can have them not go down, that will be good enough.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. It avoids commoditization of the individual products when you can take a complete solution and have this (00:56:23) show the customer the value in doing that.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. And maybe and even on the OpEx side is, your platforms, are the designs robust enough that you can win designs without Microchip employees or FAEs being involved?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, across 115,000-plus customers, a vast majority of the customers we don't have Microchip FAEs involved. You just can't have that many employees covers, so there is a large amount of effort in us building reference designs, documenting, training on the web, training in person. W train 30,000 engineers around the world in various masters' conferences, seminars and webinars and onsite customer training. So there is a \u2013 Microchip is huge. Microchip is a very vast training organization teaching our customers how to do it. And then, there is a lot of self-start help and all that where customers are designing a product. Vast majority of Microchip's customers, you do not have a Microchip FAE involved in helping them in their design. There's a Microchip FAE involved in overall general training with which they do their design. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to have enough people.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. From a geographical perspective on a year-over-year basis, you're driving growth in all of your geographies, so demand looks pretty broad based. But one of the geographies that kind of stands out is the Americas region, growth was up 5% versus the rest of the fees that were up at least double that rate. Any reason for the slower growth in the Americas region?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, the problem is we count the revenue where the product is shipped not where the product is designed. So manufacturing largely keeps moving out of Americas, and I don't know whether it will change in the coming years. So when you look at 5% Americas growth, it artificially understates it when internally we look at the revenue in the Americas counting back the revenue which was generated in America and shipped overseas and Americas growth was great. It was just as good as any other geography. It wasn't weak.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","But we report actually it's where we shipped it.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. It seems like the team has gained quite a bit of traction with these analog products with the integrated MCU cores for these, what do you guys call, smart connectivity solutions. Can you guys just give us some examples of where these type of connectivity solutions are used, applications or end markets? And when you say connectivity, are you talking about both wired and wireless connectivity integrated with your MCUs?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Go ahead.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It's both. So let's take one example which probably you have but you're not familiar with. Your car has a USB hub in it. And depending on the vintage of your car, that is a hub that has progressed over time from at one time being largely an analog-only solution to today being a smart connectivity solution where that hub has a way to recognize what is being attached to it, has a way to either be a slave or a master. It has a way to control your display, and of course, power the devices connected to it. So it's a far smarter hub today than it was several years ago. Several years ago we would've called that an analog product. And as the new designs have gone into production, those we would call as a microcontroller product.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You could take a different market \u2013 take a thermostat, a large number of thermostats nationwide, you can access them now through your phone or pad. I know I can access the thermostats in my house on my phone remotely while traveling, turn the temperature off or down or up. Or if I'm going to be on business for longer than was anticipated, I can keep the house turned off. Those are all connectivity solutions where you're doing it wirelessly. And it would have a micro Wi-Fi or a micro and a Bluetooth, for example, on the same chip, rather than two chips.","The large number of speakers in the home, you don't connect them anymore. You simply Bluetooth it from your phone into the speaker and the sound is coming. You don't really access the music through a box or something anymore these days. I mean, you can still do that, most times you access the music through the phone and just Bluetooth into any of the speakers in your home. That's connectivity wirelessly.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You can take those same general examples and apply it to Ethernet to CAN, to various forms of wireless and so on and so forth.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the insights. Thank you.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Investments.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Good evening. When you look at your business, you still see revenues growing at 7% to 9% over the next few years. And...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yes. As we are driving our business, we are modeling our business and looking at the impact of 2.0, those are the targets we are driving towards.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","And as you look at the business now, how strong do you find the Asian business and the European business?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Last year, all three businesses were very strong. If you look at just on a quarterly basis, March quarter has the Chinese New Year, so Asian business in the current quarter is always weak. European business in the March quarter, they're the strongest geography in the March quarter, and America is normal. If you look at the December quarter, usually with all the holidays and all that, Europe and America businesses were weak, and Asia business was okay. So each quarter, it's kind of slightly different. When you go to June quarter, Asia business rebounds strongly from Chinese New Year quarter of March to June. I don't know if that helps.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","All right. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Due to no response from Rajvindra (01:03:41), we'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Steve, congratulations on the solid results, especially on the operating margin. Steve, one of the questions I had, over the last several months as you talked about sort of the soft landing scenario, you kind of alluded to the potential that you could keep every quarter this calendar year in that sort of high-single digit long-term revenue growth target. Is that still kind of the way you see this calendar year playing out? And I guess secondly, if it is, do you get there on just seasonal growth sequentially or will it take some above seasonal quarters?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","John, I don't know, I think this March quarter Atmel seasonality last year kind of threw everybody off, I would say including us. And as we really dove into it and looked at our backlog and look at the business and then analyzed prior five years of Atmel business and the behavior of these large swinging for the fences accounts and design wins, the last year's performance kind of threw it off and those accounts still had a problem last year. But it was kind of overcome by the general halo of price increases and a lot of under-marketing of AVRs and all that that Atmel had done and where we improved the position, stronger distribution, and things like that.","So the number of things last year kind of threw it off, and I guess all of us together somehow didn't quite capture the blended March seasonality. So that's what we are adjusting to. So give us a little time to get our feet back on the earth and really see what effect it has on the rest of the quarter. I mean, economy is not bad, bookings are not bad, the business is not bad. We're getting strong turns, our inventory is right. We're not in a massive inventory correction mode of any kind. There's really no problem in business. We're doing well. And when you do the calculation like we have shared, we are right on target. But obviously...","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. And, Steve...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Go ahead.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well, just anecdotally, for me one of the things that's always important as we kind of orchestrate the soft landing as book-to-bill and lead times come in, are you seeing any sort of unusually high cancelation patterns or different order patterns from your customers, or are they responding to your ability to meet demands in an orderly fashion?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. So they're just responding to us shipping into a more orderly fashion. If you recall, last March to last June, the bookings were not any stronger, the book-to-bill was exactly the same because we informed the customers of lead time, they responded with higher orders out in time to respond to their lead time. And as the lead times have come in, then customers that are adjusting to their lower lead time and don't have to place outer bookings which is then lowering the book-to-bill ratio, and now it's at parity and it's moderating so customers are essentially giving us as many bookings as they need and don't have to give huge bookings out in time. This is almost perfect landing, I think, so far. The only difference, I think, street had higher expectations for March looking at March seasonality last year which was kind of typical Microchip, and basically there were lots of other factors in the business, pricing and others which match that seasonality. And this year, December to March, we can't.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, Steve.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And obviously, result is some of the other quarters have to be stronger and I think they will be and hopefully they will be. Certainly, last year they were\/ March, June, September, December, they were all stronger, and this year should be the same. Next couple of quarters should be stronger because of that March seasonality.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect.

Welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Steve, can you give us a rundown on the competitive dynamic in 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit? Have things changed over the past several years and so on? Thanks.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The number of competitors continues to be reasonably \u2013 a reasonable number of good strong competitors. We have continued to move up that ranking and so we have been gaining share in all of these product lines, including the overall microcontrollers as well. Some of these competitors have had various challenges relative to either their capacity. In some cases they're being acquired or not, so there have been those kind of things that are taking place there. But microcontrollers remains a competitive product line, a competitive market and I think that more rational actors today than they were perhaps five years ago. And they are responding, in some cases more so, or in some cases less so to the consolidation that's taking place, and that certainly helps as well. So nothing dramatic to report that is different about our competitive dynamics in microcontrollers.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","And Ganesh as a...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I mean our Microcontrollers \u2013 I'm sorry...","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","I just want to say...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Microcontrollers business is up, I think almost, 19% last year. It was higher than Microchip's growth and higher than the industry growth in that segment. Based on FIA numbers, we gained share in all three 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, and I shared with you the overall share gain by 90 bps almost. So I think things are good.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay. Would it be safe to say that the average microcontroller actor out there is not using price as a way to gain share, it's more a value proposition?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't really know if just gaining share by price has ever worked in microcontroller. These are complex parts, and over time we have shown surveys when you ask a customer what do you consider for choosing a microcontroller, the most frequent answer is the ecosystem, the tools, the support, qualities, the reliability, the customer, the samples, development tools and everything else. Price is one other factor. So these are not commodity products, it takes two years for the customer to go to production after they have made the device selection.","So price has never been really the way to gain share, but there were players in the market that were irresponsive. They will drop the price too quickly and not stand up and fight to really maintain their price. And some of those have disappeared or some of those have become better and more responsible. But overall, I don't think price has been a mechanism to gain share in the market ever.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay, good.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition, which closed on August 3. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel, and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sellthrough of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs.","Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for Microcontrollers, $165.3 million for Analog, $30.2 million for Memory, $23.2 million for Licensing, and $6.5 million of Other. Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe, and $337.2 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales, near the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint.","On a GAAP basis, net sales were$ 541.4 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses, were 55.6% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share-based compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million in acquired inventory evaluation cost and acquisition related restructuring cost.","Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $6.6 million. GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP non-recurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits.","In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the Micrel acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business, and the tax effect of various non-recurring items. Excluding any non-recurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.229, share -based compensation was about $0.067, non-recurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.028, and non-cash interest expense was about $0.036.","The dividend declared today of $0.3585 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on November 20, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and, in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, excluding the issuance and subsequent buyback of the shares in the Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash returned to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $4 billion.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015, was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by two days from the levels at the end of the June quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors is at 35 days, which is down two days from the June quarter levels.","I want to remind you that historically Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sellthrough basis. Micrel has some distributors that are recognizing revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sellthrough revenue recognition in the future.","Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sellthrough revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of the true end market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition, as any inventory in the distribution channel at the date of the conversion to sellthrough accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.","The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $150 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million.","Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders have been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016 as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rights offshore.","Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income. We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital, but our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable as dividends to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. This is a one-time event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future if an acquisition with a similar fact pattern to Micrel occurred.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results from Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel's September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. Of the Micrel revenue, approximately 3% was derived from foundry services where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called Other.","The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel. Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our Analog reporting segment, while less than 0.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our Microcontroller reporting segment.","With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with Microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our Microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior four rolling quarters.","We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter, as Micrel's revenue contributed predominately to our Analog reporting segment.","Moving to Analog, our Analog business, excluding Micrel results, was about flat in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, and was up 3.6%, as compared to the year ago quarter. In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our Analog business was up 8.6% over the prior four rolling quarters.","Our Analog business, including Micrel results, was up 30.1% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, and was up 34.8%, as compared to the year ago quarter. Including Micrel, our Analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our Analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.","Moving to our Memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E Squared (13:53) memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was down 4.8% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter.","We continue to run our Memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our Memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.","Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's Analog Power business and Ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. Micrel's Timing and Communications business remains a standalone business that is part of our Analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we are excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog, and memory products.","The sales and manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel.","Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well amidst very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales.","We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings-per-share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. The June quarter was also our 100th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters, an achievement unmatched in our industry.","I also want to thank our 90,000 plus customers worldwide for the trust they place in us in selecting our solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders, who have steadfastly supported us as we built one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry.","I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue. December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year. Investors should be careful in calculating this seasonality because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those years reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters and hence the stronger seasonality for the December quarter. The exact calculation of seasonality without the effect of these two acquisitions for the past five years is minus 3.03%.","We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel, to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially. We expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million.","Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. As we're nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low-single-digit.","I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sellthrough from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold through distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from sell-in revenue recognition to a sellthrough revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6%, and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share.","Now, let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchased the entire 8.626 million shares issued in the Micrel acquisition on the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42 \u2013 $42.888 price at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. Since then, the stock price is up about $6.80 per share, so we made an excellent decision, and it substantially improves attrition from the Micrel acquisition.","Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. I will cover a few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On November 1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial systems.","Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose, California, that is about 30% utilized. We have begun transferring all of the Micrel products from its 6-inch fab to Microchip's 8-inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona, and Gresham, Oregon. We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about one year from the acquisition date of August 3.","Regarding backend manufacturing, Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchip's, but many are same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make versus buy analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time, but keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is our highest priority.","Microchip is also combining the manufacturing systems, wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses, all these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016. Regarding sales force in the current quarter, we are combining sales forces and distribution of both companies. We expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products.","With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter. We expect the Micrel acquisition to be about $0.011 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS. This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy, in general.","Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged.","As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014, the gross margin last quarter was over 60%, and the operating profit was over 30%. At the same time \u2013 at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47%, and operating margin was only 9.3%.","We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is closed and the oldest 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you And we'll take the first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. A question for Steve, just given some of the consolidation we've seen across semis, you guys have been very successful integrating a number of small to mid-sized deals. What's your view in terms of \u2013 do think you can replicate that success with bigger deals over time?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We can replicate that success in the bigger deals, but we haven't found a deal that meets our purchase metrics.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up to that specific question, of the deals that you've done, I mean, the synergies are pretty clear in terms of improving margins. Any updates on ISSC or Supertex in terms of some revenue growth drivers that may be emerging as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yes. I gave the example of Supertex business model, which has improved very nicely, and we are \u2013 basically have lots of different design wins on Supertex that are in various stages of the incubation process. The design wins to production timeframe is usually a year and a half to two years on these complex designs, really from the date of the acquisition. So Supertex acquisition is now about 18 months, so I think probably another six months or more to go, and we should start to see some growth coming from these new design wins on Supertex. Regarding ISSC, I'll let Ganesh comment on it, how we're gaining the acceptance of Bluetooth worldwide with our ISSC efforts.","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","So when we acquired ISSC, their sales force was predominantly focused in Taiwan and in South China. But the opportunities for the Bluetooth products are really global, and over the last year plus, post the acquisition, the rest of the Microchip sales teams and channels have been working to expand the number of designs at customers that are Microchip traditional customers, and many of the applications that Microchip is strong at, so that all is activity that is in progress. We expect it will accrue as a design cycle gets completed, but we today have worldwide coverage of the ISSC product lines for Bluetooth opportunities as compared to what we inherited when we acquired the company.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both for the color.","Operator","And our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. It's clear that some of your peers that have a sell-in based disti model are now working through inventories in the channel and at their customers, and in some cases, it's a pretty substantial inventory buildup. Obviously, you guys have been under shipping consumption and normal seasonal trends now for about four quarters. Steve, how confident is the team? What metrics are you looking at to give you confidence that in the March quarter, customer inventories are in the right place and that you'll be shipping to consumption and seeing some potential growth?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Harlan, it's exactly the same question that investors and analysts have asked at a similar time in every cycle. We basically do not measure visibility by backlog, because it tends to vary by lead-times. We measure visibility by analyzing our business region by region, customer by customer, division by division, distributor by distributor, and looking at the inventory and sellthrough and all that.","So just like we see the effects of the industry events earlier and began this correction earlier, we can also see that we are ending this correction earlier, and we are now poised to resume growth in the March quarter. We were telling you when nobody was admitting that there is a substantial sell-in driven inventory build being built in distribution, and we were not getting a lot of agreement from a lot of the analysts at that time. But now you have seen, as the results have come out, that there is a substantial inventory build, and a number of companies are guiding down quite substantially, as they take that drop because of sell-in driven revenue recognition.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next will be Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. For first question, perhaps, you could talk about what you're seeing from a geographic perspective. Obviously, a lot of your peers have seen weakness that was really focused on China. And then, following on from that, Steve, given your commentary on the March quarter, typically you do have the Chinese New Year effect that affects your March quarter with growth elsewhere. Is that sort of still what you're expecting, and that's kind of baked into your expectation where we'll see some growth in the March quarter?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I mean, as far as China is concerned, I mean, we actually called it first. We were seeing substantial issues in China at thousands of small customers, who pull their horns very, very quickly because when the small customers make a mistake just once, the end result is you go out of business, while the large companies have substantial cushion and can carry inventories and correct them over time and can cash flow and buy through distributors and contract manufacturers and can return parts and do all those things. And many of the small customers, when they make a mistake, there is no second chance.","So that's why our visibility to thousands and thousands of small customers have always taught us over the years and over the decades actually that we get a glimpse of what's coming ahead in the business first, and which is what we had told you. So, yes, the problems materialized in China as we expected.","Now, as you look at the next quarter. Yes, it's a year of the Chinese New Year, the quarter of the Chinese New Year, and we will expect our business in China and Asia to be sequentially down. But we make up for that elsewhere with a very, very strong Europe and a good America. And many times, our March quarter is sequentially up, and we expect this time, too.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, great. Moving on to some of your commentary with regard to Micrel and the accretion that you expect, specifically getting to that $0.25 run rate by the end of the year, is really the catalyst for that getting the fab closed, and you talked about that, I guess it's around the August timeframe? And am I right to expect that that's the biggest driver of getting to that full-year accretion number?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's the biggest driver. But there are others, too, as we continue to, for example, this quarter we moved all the IT and business and financial systems to Microchip. In the next quarter, you see a lot of the \u2013 some of the results, some of the expense and other reductions coming from that as we're not running two parallel systems, so there's accretion all along, every quarter higher. But the big one comes from fab, and it doesn't happen right away when the fab closes. It happens more after when some of the older higher-priced 6-inch inventory is sold, which is about six months after the fab closes. So that's why I'm saying around the end of next calendar year.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. And just the final follow-on, how would we see that in the gross \u2013 do you have a metric we can look at in terms of how that will benefit gross margins?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, you should expect that that will \u2013 just like Supertex, we began with 47%, and last quarter its gross margin was over 60%. And that was exactly six quarters after we closed the Supertex deal. So six quarters after we close the Micrel deal, you can expect the gross margin to have a 6 in front of it.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian overnight. Hey, just a quick follow-up on Caso's question. So, Steve, between these cost savings on the OpEx versus gross margin side, would you say it's one third on the OpEx and two-thirds on the gross margin, or any little bit of color there would be appreciated?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the Micrel accretion?","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I haven't done the math on one-third, two-third, but I think the Micrel expenses are in the mid-30% range. And as we bring them towards mid-20% range, that's the synergy you should get from that. And then, the gross margins grow from, let's say, 50% to 60%.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Perfect. And then just for a brief follow-up, so I think most of your competitors have reported, you've seen their results or looking at your results, I mean, essentially, you guys are guiding for normal seasonality. I mean, how do you feel about your positioning versus the competition right now if you take a look at what your competitors have reported?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Chris, why don't we just talk about our business and what we see and let them worry about theirs?","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Well, thanks for taking the question. I'll start off with one for Ganesh. Ganesh, acknowledging that the Analog and MCU businesses have hundreds of products and tens of thousands of customers, the growth variance between the two seem to be at the wide end of what we typically see. Is there anything in particular going on in the two product lines, or is that just the byproduct of what we're seeing as we kind of wrap up an inventory correction?","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","The question \u2013 you said the growth between the two product lines are \u2013 say that again, please?","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","About 400 basis points difference, MCU is down 4% sequentially, Analog was flat. That 400 basis point variance, at least in my model, is at the wider end of the range we typically see.","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","Quarter to quarter, you're going to have small changes that are there. Analog has been growing faster for several quarters as you've seen. We're continuing to complement our organic growth with the acquisition growth, as well, over time. I would not take anything particular out of the numbers in one quarter, where you have a small difference in growth rate between Microcontrollers and Analog. Both product lines continue to perform well in terms of new designs, and we expect will continue to grow across the 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit spectrum in Micros and across a broader spectrum in Analog.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","And a follow-up on the upside, it sounds like all of the Micrel parts will port into Microchip fabs. One, is that so, and two, as we look at Microchip's internal versus external production capacity, where are we overall right now and where will we be once the Micrel port in is done?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yes, confirmation that all of Micrel's parts will port into Microchip's two 8-inch facilities with the only exception that 100% of Micrel's parts don't run into Micrel fab. What was that number?","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","I'd say 70%.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","About 70% of their products ran in their own 6-inch fab and the rest ran in professional foundries. We're not bringing any of the professional foundries parts in at this stage, nor do we plan in future. We're simply bringing all the parts from the Micrel 6-inch fab to inside. The second part of your question was what?","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Microchip's internal fab intensity.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We can absorb all of Micrel products in our inside fab and still have plenty of clean room space left over in our Oregon fab to really add many, many hundreds of millions of dollars of additional revenue, so there's no really problem. There's lots of clean room space here to install the equipment as we go. With several quarters of weak performance we have had driven by very weak market, our factories are not full today. We just took a nine-day shutdown in our Oregon fab in the month of October, and in the current quarter, we have scheduled a similar shutdown in our Arizona fab in December. So even after absorbing all of Micrel products, I think we still have internally slightly higher inventory, not fully loaded, room to expand, and no problem.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","That's helpful color, Steve. Thank you, and then the last one a detail for Eric. You mentioned the $250 million cash onshoring. When will that occur, Eric?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That will happen this month.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Good evening. My question has been answered, and congratulations on that stock purchase. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gil.","Operator","And we'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, a question for Steve and Ganesh. Guys, we've heard auto business commentary ranging from so-so, okay, all the way to horrible, at least in the short term \u2013 call it, last quarter, quarter and a half. I'm curious how your auto business is tracking relative to what we're hearing in the industry?","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","We have a range of both applications we're designed into as well as regions of the world. The overall automotive business was down in the quarter. Obviously, there are parts of the world where automotive is not doing as well. But there are also other parts of the world where it has been strong, and the sellthrough has been strong, the U.S. as a good example. So it follows geographically where the sales have been. But automotive continues to be in the current environment one of the stronger segments relative to the other segments for us.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thank you, Ganesh. And then, Steve, in your commentary, you talked about inventory correction nearing the end. But I gather, just reading between the parts and pieces that you talked about, that demand is still, call it, lackluster at best. As investors and as sell-side guys, what can we follow to get an idea as a factor, when demand will start to tick up for Microchip?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, considering we do business with 90,000-plus customers, it's very, very hard to really latch on to any kind of indicator. Most market checks that you occasionally \u2013 that you guys occasionally refer to does not seem to work for our business very, very well.","We do business with \u2013 so, for example, just two weeks ago, I was in Asia, and I spent two weeks there. I met during that trip \u2013 I personally had meetings with 60-plus Asian distributors, at their presidents and product marketing heads that drive Microchip business, 60-plus, personally. And so, that's the view on a first-hand basis I bring to you regarding what I see there. And you cannot match that by any kind of so-called channel checks. So I just have trouble telling you really what you could track, because the business is just so diversified, so broad and 90,000 plus customers.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, Steve.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","The next question is from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. First, a housekeeping one. Revenue total, I guess, I would call it non-GAAP revenue for Micrel, was that $39.5 million or higher than that?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","$39.5 million was Micrel's revenue, non-GAAP.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For two months.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","For the two \u2013 understood. One other, understanding that we appear to be passing through the bottom of this cycle, I'm wondering if you can give us a view as to what growth coming out of it looks like. It seemed that in December of last year, Steve, you \u2013 as I recall, you seemed to indicate that we were coming out of it and then quickly sort of back into this not very good demand environment. I think now you're telling us we're sort of approaching the end of the inventory correction. How should we expect growth coming out of the cycle to look, both near-term where we'd normally expect sort of more of a snap back than just normal seasonality? And then, longer term how do think the business grows?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, if you look at last year, in December, we were coming out of that, and our March quarter was sequentially up last year without any effect of any acquisition, totally clean. Our March quarter was sequentially up. And then, lots of other events developed, the whole falloff of the Chinese stock market, lots and lots of customers invested their money in the Chinese stock market and lost it, and Chinese payment terms are starting to mimic Italy.","In many cases, our distributors are telling us they're concerned about getting paid. People are pushing out schedules, pushing out launch of the new products, cutting down the run rates, cutting down inventories, so there are additional things that happened. Now, all that environment is currently dialed in our guidance. You know, question is does it get any worse than that? Is there another shoe to drop or driven by anything. That we don't know. That kind of view we don't have. This is based on what we are able to see today.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Just going into a little more detail of the 60-plus distributors that you met with in Asia. Are they stocking distributors or more of a design type distributors that would prefer that you hold the inventory and they sell through?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, all these distributors, they hold the inventory. They also have dedicated application engineers for Microchip, which help the customer to design-in our products into the end customer socket. And then, they ship it from the inventory. The Asian distributors will hold in months of inventory, lesser inventory than an equivalent U.S. distributor will hold just because they work on much lower margin. So if they work on a lower margin, they have to hold lower inventory. Otherwise, it's not affordable. But they're all stocking distributors. So these are not like reps. What you're talking about is either reps or...","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer","Design houses.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Design houses and things like that. We have some of those, too, but these people I'm talking about are real-life distributors.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So maybe for some of the visibility that maybe the design houses have, are you seeing design activity? Is this what gives you some optimism that you'll see a uptick in demand, that there's new designs happening?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So Asia-wide consolidated \u2013 I have the number for worldwide, also. I don't have it on my fingertips. But entire Asia combined \u2013 Asia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, everything \u2013 all Asia combined, our total design win dollar revenue was 15% higher this year than it was last year.","So when I look at on the graph, how on a monthly basis design win dollars progressed, it was 15% higher than a year ago. But when you look at the net new revenue created from those designs this year versus the net new revenue created from new design wins last year, it was about a fourth of it, which was \u2013 and it was consistent geography to geography, distributor to distributor. Whether you look at Japan or you look at Korea or you look at China, it was really no different, which was a broad-based sign of very good excellent design win activity, but customers were all holding back, either not taking their designs to production or running much lower run rate in dollars on those designs in terms of unit consumption or not having the money to launch it. The effects of the Chinese stock market crash, I talked about.","So this was universal across the board. And sooner or later, those customers got to run their businesses, also. When they take those designs to production, you will see sort of the other side of that, a very pent-up new product design activity. As it goes to production, the business really takes off.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Very good color. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on 100 consecutive quarters of profitability. A question for Eric, the fact pattern, could you describe or give us a framework for thinking about the fact pattern that you have with Micrel that allows you to bring back cash tax-free? What are the circumstances there? Of the deals that you look at, as you guys look at, what percent of the targets or potential targets that you've been looking at have this kind of a fact pattern that might be \u2013 allow you to bring back more cash? Thank you.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, obviously, every transaction is different than the next. But in Micrel's situation, they had not really done any foreign tax planning. And unlike most companies in our space that are maybe more mature or higher revenue, higher profits, they've done that. And so, all of Micrel's IP was sitting, intellectual property, was sitting in the U.S. And so, to get that into our structure, we have to move that value of that intellectual property offshore. Microchip is sitting on some net operating losses in the U.S. that can soak up that income coming in. That's net operating losses that have been generated for a variety of different reasons over the course of time. But in this particular situation, we're able to bring the cash back and not pay cash taxes on that in the U.S.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up question. And apologize if this was already answered, but on the manufacturing footprint, I think the team was going to do a major shutdown, I think PM on the Gresham fab in October. Did you guys actually execute to this? And then, given the lower December outlook and the rise of inventories in September, I assume that you guys are still planning for a December shutdown of the Tempe fab and then a few days extra beyond that to work down inventories. What do you expect your level of inventories to be exiting the December quarter?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So affirmative on both of those. We did execute the planned shutdown for the Gresham fab, and we are on schedule to execute a maintenance shutdown at the end of the year in our Arizona fab. The shutdown we had announced in the Arizona fab before, we're not making it any shorter, we're not making it any longer. We're holding it to what we have told you before. And the inventory going out of September quarter was 120 ...","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","125 days.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","125 days total, and going out of December would be ...","J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So our guidance that's in our release says that inventory will be between \u2013 well, it will be flat to up six days.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","J.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition actives and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were a record $972.1 million, above the high end of our June 5, 2017, upwardly revised guidance and up 7.7% sequentially from net sales of $902.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted the summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.4% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.9% of sales, below the low end of our guidance range of 23%. And non-GAAP operating income was a record 37.5%, well above the high end of the our guidance of 37%.","Non-GAAP net income was a record $319.1 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.31, which was $0.07 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.24, up 12.9% on a sequential basis and up 56% as compared to the same quarter last year.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 60.1% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation and $0.7 million benefit from the recovery of material that was previously written off due to a vendor material issue.","Total operating expenses were $362.8 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $120.8 million, share-based compensation of $19 million, $2.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special income of $2.8 million, consisting primarily of the gain on the sale of the Micrel San Jose wafer fab in the June quarter. After these adjustments, GAAP net income was a record $170.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.7% in the June quarter. The GAAP tax rate was negative 2.6% in the quarter. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.25% and 9.25%. The large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences in the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at June 30, 2017 was $426.8 million. Microchip had 100 days of inventory at June 30, down three days from the end of the March quarter. Inventory days are at a seven year low and we don't expect inventory days to grow in the current quarter as our capacity increases are hardly keeping pace with the increases in demand we are seeing in the business. Inventory at our distributors was at 31 days and that was down two days from the March quarter levels.","The cash flow from operating activities was a record at $345 million in the June quarter. As of June 30 the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.65 billion, of which about $546 million is domestic cash.","We continued to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the June quarter at 1.58. This is down from 1.94 at the end of the March quarter. Our EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $395.6 million. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be under 1.3 by the end of September. Our net debt-to-EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20 year maturity date. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is in excellent condition and declining rapidly, so we're not going to continue to share this metrics in our earnings calls in future periods unless there is a material change.","During the June quarter, we received about $40 million of capital at our facilities. Capital spending for the quarter was only $22.1 million due to the timing of the receipt of the equipment and when it was paid for. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $180 million.","We are aggressively adding capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business over time, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $29 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the businesses in the June quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased with how all our product lines performed in the June quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue to produce differential growth results. These are our first results since we unveiled Microchip 2.0 to our investors about two months ago. We look forward to sharing many more updates of our transformation to Microchip 2.0 as we continue to enable our clients with the very best smart, connected and secure embedded applications.","Let's now take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business performed very strongly in the June quarter with revenue being up 9.5% sequentially as compared to the March quarter, setting a new record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter microcontroller revenue was up a whopping 18.1%. The June quarter of this year and the year-ago June quarter are completely comparable, as they both represent a full quarter of combined Microchip and Atmel business.","We continue to see clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel's heritage express confidence in Microchip's stewardship of these product families. As a result, we are seeing more designs that are in the pipeline, going to production and ramping in volume. We're also seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.","Microcontrollers had over $2.5 billion in annualized revenue, representing 65.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. Additionally, we shipped our 20 billionth cumulative microcontroller in the June quarter. In the June quarter, we also started sampling the PIC32 C product line, our first PIC32 microcontroller, which happened to have an ARM core, so we now have PIC32 microcontrollers with MIPS and ARM cores within them, both of which are supported by the Microchip development tools ecosystem. This is consistent with what we have always said, which is that the core inside the microcontroller is not as important as the brand on the outside, along with the attendant brand promise for what clients expect from PIC microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller business gained further market share in the second quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our June quarter results. In fact, the results show that all our microcontroller product lines are firing on all cylinders and driving differential growth and market share gains. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we advance the Microchip 2.0 transformation and build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Moving now to our analog business, our analog product revenue was up 3.7% sequentially in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter and also set a new record in the process. Our analog results were negatively impacted by capacity constraints on products with Atmel heritage, without which the growth would have been higher. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter analog revenue was up 11.2%, well ahead of the market growth rate for analog. At over $950 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 24.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter.","We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach microcontroller's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products, as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion annualized revenue business for Microchip sometime in fiscal year 2018 and a much larger business in the coming years.","Moving now to our licensing business. Our licensing business was up 8.5% sequentially in the June quarter and set a new record in the process as annualized revenue broke through the $100 million mark for the first time ever. For the last three to four years, we have licensed multiple foundries and independent device markers on multiple process technology nodes and have been working to enable getting these technologies qualified for production. We expect the fruits of this work will soon begin to manifest in our licensing results as the licensed processes start generating royalty revenue for many, many years to come.","Moving to our memory business. This business was sequentially up 8.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We have been very successful in our memory business using the combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel and getting the best from each. There are significant cost reductions underway using Atmel-originated silicon, which will be assembled and tested using Microchip's back-end factories to achieve the lowest overall cost. We believe that this effort will make us even more competitive and improve gross margins further. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","Finally, before I conclude, a couple of general items. First, in case there are any lingering concerns about the automotive end market in light of the results announced by some of our competitors and the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of automobile shipments, also known as SAAR, which some analysts track, we would like to categorically state that our automotive business performance was strong in the June quarter, with sequential growth pretty close to the Microchip's overall performance.","Now this is understandable as Microchip content tends to be in mid to high end cars, which are less sensitive to inventory and consumer cycles, and we continue to benefit from the growth in automobile electronics as well as our market share gains in the automotive market segment. Therefore Microchip's automotive business does not necessarily track with the SAAR numbers, and we expect our automotive business to perform well again in the September quarter.","For more information about our automotive business, we refer you to a presentation we made on June 6 at an automotive-focused investor conference, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Secondly, on the heels of our ranking in April by Semicast as one of the top 10 largest automotive semiconductor companies, IHS in June ranked Microchip as one of the top 10 largest industrial semiconductor companies and among the top three largest micro-component suppliers to the industrial market. Micro-components in the IHS report refer to microcontrollers and microprocessors. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance, and as we shared with you in May, they together represent about 60% of our revenue.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Well, how do you like the results from Microchip 2.0? Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2018. I will also provide update on capacity enhancement activities, as well as Microchip 2.0 that we introduced to the investors during the last quarter.","Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our net sales were a huge new record and well above the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP net sales for this quarter were up 15.2% from the June quarter of a year ago and this revenue comparison is not impacted by any acquisition since Atmel's full quarter revenue was in the June 2016 quarter.","Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded the high end of our guidance and each crossed significant milestones. Our non-GAAP gross margin crossed the important 60% milestone, non-GAAP operating profit exceeded 37% for the first time and non-GAAP earnings per share crossed an important run rate of well over $5 per share annualized.","Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 56% from the June quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 107th consecutive profitable quarter.","There are three other points I would like to make on our sales growth. First, every one of our major product lines, 8-bit MCU, 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU, analog, wireless, licensing, memory and others were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year ago quarter. Number two, every major geography, North America, Europe and Asia, were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter. And number three, sales in all end markets were up in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter.","Regarding the reason for the large sequential and year-over-year growth, I will refer you back to Microchip 2.0. We are experiencing an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. This is also demonstrated in the recent EE Times survey. The EE Times survey also indicates that customers believe that Microchip has the best ecosystem in the industry.","On the top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. Our sales channels have been trained and are welcoming the opportunity to sell multiple products to our customers in the same board. As a result our customers are responding by giving us incremental design wins with multiple products in the same board. We have an enormous design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that in Microchip 2.0 we will continue to see the acceleration in the organic growth of Microchip.","Now, before I go into the guidance for our September quarter, I will say that we are continuing to see a very strong business environment for our products worldwide and have a number of company-specific demand drivers. Our bookings rate in the June quarter was extremely strong. Our inventories at Microchip as well as at the distributors are towards the low end of the normal range. Both inventories at Microchip as well as distributors declined further sequentially in the June quarter. While our manufacturing operations produced a lot more units in the June quarter, we shipped them all for growth and did not progress towards improving our inventory position.","However, through the growth of capacity and producing a lot more units, our lead times have stabilized. While lead times are still longer than what we would like them to be, they're not getting any longer and we appear to have created a soft landing so far without triggering any double ordering or panic from our customer base.","We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. We will continue to add additional capacity in all of our fabs, assembly test plants, foundries and sub-contractors. In the back end, there are too many product tester\/handler combinations. We are catching up on some of those combinations, as we convert Atmel products to Microchip's more efficient assembly test platforms. However, we don't expect to fully catch up on all product tester\/handler combinations until the middle of calendar year 2018.","Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect total net sales to be up approximately 3% sequentially, which represents approximately 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. I want to remind investors that in the last five years, we had three acquisitions that closed in the September quarter: SMSC closed in August of fiscal year 2013; ISSC closed in July of fiscal year 2015 and Micrel closed in August of fiscal year 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking the average of the last five years of sequential growth will give you a number of 6.7% and that number would be totally wrong.","Excluding these acquisitions, the average sequential growth in the September quarter over the past five years, has been just under 0.5% and ranged between minus 2.6% and plus 6.5%. Our current sequential revenue guidance of 3% growth and year-over-year guidance of 14.6% growth is showing substantial organic growth, consistent with the Microchip 2.0 that we have presented to investors. As a result, in September quarter, we expect to see our first $1 billion quarter.","Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the September quarter to be between 60.5% to 60.75% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22.5% and 23% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 37.5% and 38.25% of sales, and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.33 and $1.37 per share.","In our last quarter, we revised up our long-term financial model to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 62.5%, operating expense of 22.5% and operating profit of 40% and as you have seen, we are relentlessly marching towards this model. This quarter we would like to share with investors our longer-term annual growth expectations of high single digit growth. This higher growth expectation comes from our transformation to Microchip 2.0 and an environment which we expect through industry consolidation will continue to improve from a pricing discipline standpoint.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provides more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and outlook. Steve, you mentioned pricing discipline as being an important factor. When I look at the two other microcontroller companies that are bigger than Microchip, Renesas, and NXP, do you see this pricing discipline pervasive in the industry? Or I assume you really mostly talk about Microchip, but what about your competitors, do you see this pervasive through the industry?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The pricing discipline is improving and to a different extent with various manufacturers. I can't mention it, the names of the competitors and specifically what they are doing, but we have seen some discipline on others also, some more than the others. Microchip has kind of led this charge in the last five years, and especially after the acquisition of Atmel, whose pricing was really below acceptable pricing, we have quite substantially corrected those pricing and we have seen others who were relatively undisciplined also make some correct moves in that direction.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I see. And so my follow up, you have mentioned a few times the concept of attaching more analog products. Is there a way to quantify what that attach rate is, how it's trended and whether it's even useful to analyze this trend?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well it's not something we can completely externally share, but we have large number of internal indicators, which are really driven by number of Microchip products per customer board. So if you think about years ago, we just sold microcontrollers and you will usually have one device per customer board. We have well in excess of one device per customer board and the larger and larger that number becomes means you are being able to attach more and more devices, and rather than the attach, we kind of use the word these days, total system solutions. So we track that internally and it's moving in the positive direction. It's not something we plan to share with the Street as just one other thing to track and hit us over the head with.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We also have some examples in some of the investor conference presentations and again if you go back to Steve's presentation from back in early June, you'll see some examples of what exactly total system solution means.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And those slides are still on the Internet. You can check it in the investor page.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Vivek.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Congratulations on the record quarter and thanks very much for taking the question. The question was on the lead times. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more quantification of how extended lead times have gotten to and just any sort of differences between different types of products and if you can put into context versus prior cycles.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So our lead times on most products today are between, I would say, 4 weeks and 20 weeks. So lots and lots of products are kind of normal on lead time. It could be version of a given silicon that is longer, but other versions are shorter, so a large bracket around it is about 4 weeks to 20 weeks. But more important part is really, they're not getting any longer. They were getting longer in the prior quarters, as we extended and the normal lead times we will consider where 90% of our products can be bought in 4 to 8 weeks.","So that's kind of the bracket and with the capacity growth we have had, we have been able to stabilize the lead time, but as I said in my remarks, we're essentially shipping all the excess production for growth and not able to either lower the amount of delinquent product, or unsupported product, nor are we able to really dramatically shorten the lead times. On some products with tester\/handler product combinations have caught up, yes, but in broad majority, lead times are stable but not coming in yet.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And for a follow-up question, somewhat related to that, in your prepared remarkets, Steve, you commented that you think by stabilizing lead times, you think you can engineer a soft landing. You've always been very thoughtful on the cycle and in revenue growth. Any more detail either for the industry or Microchip specifically about what's baked into that assumption about a soft landing and how exactly you go from sort of mid-teens growth to what's assumed in a soft landing scenario? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I don't have any comments on the industry. I resigned from that job two years ago. We're just simply \u2013 I will comment on Microchip. And what I'm seeing is that by lead times really not going longer and taking almost a year to bring these lead times down, that we're guiding to really by the middle of next year, we believe we already have engineered a soft landing and not creating any panic, not having runaway book-to-bill ratio, strong backlog, fair amount of unsupported product. But still largely good behavior on the part of customers and distributors. Inventory is still very low all over the board. Our distributor inventories are low. Our Microchip inventories are lowest in seven years. This is essentially engineering a soft landing.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I had a couple sort of clarifying questions around your longer-term growth rate of high single digits. Is that your view on an organic basis or will that continue to include sort of the successful M&A strategy you've employed in the past? And if it's more the former than the latter, does that change your view on M&A? In addition, you talked about better pricing. I'd just be kind of curious from where we were to where you think we're going, how much pricing adds to that.","And then my last point would just be market share, and I guess around that specifically the time when some of your peers are kind of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take economics from them, you're taking sort of a more of a Switzerland approach and kind of spreading the wealth a little bit. Do you think that's having a positive effect just through the distribution channel, and that enormous design funnel you were talking about? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Those were a number of questions. Let me see if I can remember all of them.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","First one was organic growth is our, what you talked about -","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So the high single digit kind of growth I talked about is organic. The acquisitions are unpredictable. You do not know when they happen. You cannot schedule them. So that growth rate is organic. Now we believe over the last several years as the industry growth has been fairly slow, with the exception of this current year where the industry growth has been reasonable, there was always unit growth, but the entire unit growth was eaten up by the year-over-year price decreases and pricing pressures and bad practices in our industry constantly to give the price away. As through consolidation and other reasons as large companies have got in pricing discipline, we believe that unit growth is not being eaten up by the price drop. So some of that price discipline is built in into the longer-term organic growth guidance we're giving. And the second part was?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The second question he asked was does the change in your view on organic growth change the M&A strategy.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Does it change the M&A strategy, it does not change the M&A strategy. If we find a right company that fits well, we can buy it at a reasonable price, is accretive going in and with all the other \u2013 check all of the boxes that we have, sort of a pretty proprietary scheme of how we essentially select an acquisition, if we can do that we will do it. However, as you know, the herd is thinning. There are fewer companies left and the valuations are quite high as we speak. But as we're able to find some things on reasonable valuation, it doesn't change our view.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","All right, and John, I think the last piece of your question was market share. I'd like you to repeat that question to make sure we answer it specifically.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, to the extent \u2013 how much of the high single digit long-term growth is expected market share gains and specifically at a time when some of your peers are sort of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take back some economics from their distribution partners, you seem to be taking more of a Switzerland approach and perhaps spreading the wealth a little bit more. And I'm just kind of curious as to what extent you think that's really helping that design funnel you referenced your prepared comments?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, these distribution things go in cycles. You made a call 10 years ago, we were taking some actions on distribution when we felt that certain distributors were not creating demand, and a decade later now some other people feel the same way. So these things kind of go in cycles.","But what we're experiencing is currently, as a number of our competitors have defranchised either distributor completely or they have narrowed their margins and not giving them demand creation margin, we have seen these distributors put a tremendous attention and focus on Microchip and especially with a broadened product line sort of under the Microchip 2.0 initiative that we have, we are finding that distributors are finding the new Microchip 2.0 product portfolio to be so much more desirable and essentially being able to replace the number of other competitive companies where they have lost a franchise on, including microcontroller, analog, wireless, USB, Ethernet, wired products, USB, Ethernet and wireless, just really timing is just perfect for the distribution to grab onto our broad portfolio, and do a great job for us. So I think we are taking advantage of it right now.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then Steve, if I could sneak one more in, clearly your initial intent around the Atmel acquisition was to buy back stock, and you ended up not doing that. The stock's had a good absolute run since then, but if you kind of look at the relative valuation of Microchip to the S&P, I think by our math this is one of the lowest levels we've seen in almost 15 years. And so can you talk a little bit about the appetite to do some buybacks here, and whether or not, given where you are on your net leverage and your ability to generate cash flow, that that might become a more systematic way of returning cash to shareholders?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, the net leverage isn't a problem now. We're down to 1.58 and we'll be lower again by the end of September. That's not the issue. I think the issue is the majority of the cash is still overseas and we've got about $0.5 billion or so here domestically, and we're still looking for the next acquisition. So it really wouldn't make sense to buy a bunch of stock back and then either have to issue stock in the next acquisition or really then borrow large amounts of money. So I don't think buying back stock really fits right now.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Thanks and congratulations again, guys.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very strong results and outlook. Steve, I know you're out of the sort of broader semi cycle discussion, but as it relates to your business, you've got very good year-over-year growth that you just posted. The guidance suggest it moderates slightly sequentially. Let's say you beat that a little bit; you're still growing very solid double digits year-over-year. What do you anticipate with your new high single digits long-term growth view, how do you anticipate sort of the back part of this cycle to look like? At what pace do you expect that growth that's very strong right now to moderate?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't really have a whole lot to say on that in terms of cycle. I think we are seeing a very, very strong demand for our products. I think it's largely driven by a lot of company-specific drivers in analog, in attach, in being able to take Atmel portfolio that was being marketed in a substandard way. Costs were high. Other things were not right and we're correcting a lot of those things and being able to attach analog, wireless and other products to that portfolio.","So a lot of it is really company-specific drivers and so I think really this growth momentum continues. We didn't want it to get over frothy and get into double ordering and holding and all that. I believe we're successfully avoiding that by engineering a soft landing. So somewhere over the next year, I think it goes from the current growth rate to the long-term growth rate almost in a soft landing fashion.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful. One other question, it's actually a product question. I normally don't spend a lot of time in this area, especially in your press releases, but you highlighted in the first bullet regarding highlights from the quarter a new product with a 2D GPU integrated. I wonder, is that representative of any new trend as it relates to AI inference on the edge, perhaps. Are you seeing more demand for that sort of processing capability and if you could talk about the market for that sort of product, it would be very helpful. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, I'll have Ganesh comment on that, but let me read the bullet for all the investors. It says Microchip announced the industry's first microcontroller with integrated 2D GPU and integrated DDR2 memory. Our PIC32MZ DA family provides ground-breaking capabilities for an MCU. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, yeah, this is not really related to artificial intelligence. This is in embedded applications, there is a set of applications where people want the richness of the human interface to include graphics that have more capability. Those have historically been done with separate processors that did the microcontroller or microprocessor and the graphics on a separate chip. We are now putting those together, creating more complete solutions where the microcontroller, the graphics and the DRAM that's required are all on the same chip and in the same package. So, it's an extension of continuing to have high performance microcontrollers, opening up new embedded control spaces.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good evening, guys. I guess the first question just a follow-on on the steps you're taking with regard to the soft landing. And I think we understand what you're saying there. Perhaps you could talk about what's different in the steps that you are taking now, as compared to some prior cycles when your lead times extended. Is it now that you've moved more quickly to expand some capacity and prevent the lead times from getting higher? And maybe if could just expand upon that.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think the main difference is, your memory is probably of the event two or three years ago. Was it 2014 I think, there was basically a abrupt contraction in the Chinese business at that time, which we mentioned in our call, and that's really what led to a quarterly miss and then cycle unraveling, and it was seen by the entire industry subsequently within three, four months of that, even though a lot of the investors and analysts originally did not see it. We saw it first. I can't predict the world events. There's a war somewhere, something else happens and some sort of event to terminate or to change it. So I think that was the main difference. If your outlook is that some sort of strong event takes place somewhere, then all bets change, that I cannot forecast.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Okay. I don't have a crystal ball for that either. Just with the follow-on, on gross margins, perhaps you could talk about some of the specific benefits over the next few quarters. I know that you're still working to consolidate some of the manufacturing. There's still some steps that will benefit gross margins aside from just better fixed cost absorption.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, we're ramping all six of our facilities. Three are front end wafer fabs and our three back-end facilities, investing significant capital and those investments increase the utilization in the facilities, make us more cost effective, make the cost per unit go lower. And so, there's a lot of things happening across the board. There's a lot happening in back-end manufacturing which we've talked about more extensively where the lot of the capital dollars are going. And as those come to fruition, the gross margin is going to improve. This last quarter, we continued to see benefits from the Micrel shutdown and most of that is in the model at this point in time, but there's still a little bit of that to go. But the main things are really the capacity improvements pricing as Steve has talked about publically, continues to be a driver of gross margin and we think that's going to continue as better practices happen throughout the industry.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, and I'll throw my hat in the ring on the congratulations on good execution. And I'll just start on that point and go back to two points that you made, Steve, one the target for high single digit long-term growth and the view that that's attainable, and secondly, that with Microchip 2.0, organic sales should accelerate. You've recently presented I think it's seven points on revenue growth related to Microchip 2.0. So with an eye towards monitoring the leverage that are really going to drive that growth acceleration, what are the things that us investors should be focused on as we monitor Microchip's progress to drive accelerating growth under those seven initiatives?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Are you picking up seven initiatives from our conference call presentation?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","That was from your presentation of Microchip 2.0 I believe. I think you had seven different revenue growth drivers there.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Just pulling it up. I think your question is really sort of how can investors track it. So, a lot of it is related to being able to sell a large number of peripheral products around the main microcontroller, which you sometime call it attach and we're calling it total system solution. We are seeing it in our funnel. We are seeing it in number of design wins of devices per board going up from one, like one would be no attach. So a lot of these things we don't plan to share it externally, I think. So that's part of the challenge.","But total system solution we will track it internally. You can track customer preference to design with our MCUs. That analysts and investors can track. There's an EE Times survey which is public. It's on their website. When asked the customers which microcontroller do you expect to use for your next embedded design on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 8 and 16, we were number one. And 32-bit, if you combine ours and Atmel and two or three different lines, we're number one tied again over there too. So that you can track.","We have multiple growth drivers as we quarter-after-quarter talk to you about growth of our microcontroller business, growth of licensing business, growth of analog business. We don't break out our wireless business, wired and wired connectivity. A lot of that is embedded into the analog business. We have tremendous growth going on in our security business as people in IoT are looking for security for transactions, security of being able to connect to the device. We have number of key assets in that area. Automotive business is doing very well in networking, in HMI, in access control, lighting, body electronics. You can see some of that through our press release, continuous flow of press release we are having with most of us and other. So, I think it's complex tracking, but it's all there.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for the color on that. The follow-up question will be for Eric and it's just related to inventory. So seven year lows on hand. The channel is lean. Is that a level that Microchip can comfortably operate at if we think about the intermediate term or should we expect in what would typically be a seasonally softer period like the fiscal third quarter that the company would look to replenish some inventory whether it's in the channel on hand or both.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So channel inventory, we can't really manage other than the fact of delivering the product that the distributors want. So that's a little bit tougher, but it is on the low end of what we've seen historically. Our own inventory, we've been trying to build inventory on the balance sheet for the last three quarters and just haven't been able to do so with the upsides in demand that we've experienced. So this quarter we expect to not build inventory again. The lead time commentary that Steve talked about getting healthy by the middle of calendar 2018, I think that's probably at the point when inventories might return to a more normalized level. But it's very hard to predict what the demand environment is going to be.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So you talked about a seasonally softer December quarter in which we could build some inventory. I think what's more likely is that we are able to catch up on some of the delinquencies and unsupported product leading to better than seasonal December, but not building inventories, because you can't build inventory before you have given the product to the customer to meet their demand. So it's more likely that we will reduce the unsupported amount of product than building inventory. So that's what it looks like right now.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay. So from what you can see now, the demand from your customers, as well as the timing with which new capacity is coming online, both front end and back end, would lead you to believe that it's likely that there'll be some demand catch-up and you could have an above seasonal December quarter, Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Not really numerically guiding it, but directionally I expect it better than seasonal December.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for the help. Good luck.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid execution and outlook. On the strong quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year performance in MCUs, I'm just wondering if the Atmel products grew faster than the overall MCU segment. Just post closure, you had higher confidence levels by Atmel's customers. You've got their refreshed 8-bit AVR product line and other enhancements. It's only been more than a year post Atmel. You guys are probably still seeing some of that momentum. Just wondering if this is driving some enhanced growth in the product line.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So we're not commenting on any breakout of growth on Atmel products versus our growth. In some cases, a product can even be substituted and like we said from the very beginning, we manage it as one company and give the customer the best solution, where we have product available or can meet its needs, in some cases, switch from one to other. If the product is not available in one category, make it available in the other category. So I think individually commenting on where the growth is coming from is really not meaningful at this point in time.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then on the transformation to Microchip 2.0 and then the results of the EE Times survey, I mean the team has already had a strong systems focus in place for a long period of time. I think you guys have something like over 2,500 reference platforms, development boards, sample projects, et cetera. So you guys already had a pretty strong program in place to help customers with their design solutions and drive attach rates. So how does Microchip 2.0 build upon this to further drive the attach rates of analog, connectivity, networking, memory and interface products?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So that's a good question, and let me take a shot at answering it. So Microchip 2.0 is not an event where I flipped a switch today. Microchip 2.0 has been in formation for about five years, and which you yourself said in when we acquired SMSC, we got USB technology, we got Ethernet technology, we got audio technology. When we bought Micrel, we got a number of great analog assets. When we bought Atmel, we got some Wi-Fi assets, we got some security assets and Atmel's large microcontroller portfolio. As you go to the customers, there was largely one product per board. Atmel sold the microcontroller. There was no Microchip analog or anything else present around it, because we were the enemies, so it will be anybody else's product but Microchip's.","And in the last year, on all the internal reference designs, development tools, sales brochures, and sales training and all that, it's now full with Microchip's analog and power management and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, timing products and all that kinds of stuff. So, this has been a thing in building and we are really just packaging it for you now and saying we are seeing it working, and it took some time to train the apps engineers and sales force and get the distribution aligned with what some other companies have done with their distribution also gave us an opportunity.","So it's really culmination of all these initiatives coming together, where we can tie a board on and say, hey this looks like a new company to our distributors today and to our salespeople and others and saying I can sell a very broad portfolio today. Take any one company out of it, Atmel, it substantially reduces it. Take Micrel out, reduces it further. Take SMSC out, it reduces it further. So it's a build-up on all these companies. I don't know if that helps you.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. That does. Thanks for the insight, Steve.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Steve, I'll ask you to refrain from any industry predictions, but it sounds like the improvement in Microchip is mostly Microchip specific. So, between what you're seeing and what your distis are seeing, how do you think like the overall semi business, sort of the overall semi industry, did during the June quarter? Do you think it just kind of held serve, or do you think there was some improvement sort of industry-wide that happened during the quarter?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I was hoping that SIA announce their June numbers. Usually they always announced it on July 31. This one time I needed it and they did not, and I was going to use that to comment on it. I think they're going to announce later this week, and that would be a read on the industry. l don't really have any comment on the industry.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then one quick clarification. So on the lead times stretching out, when do you think you could take them back to normal? Do you think it's like a year from now or maybe six months from now, or when do you think we can get back to normal?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I earlier said, the lead times are right now between four weeks and 20 weeks and are stable, not going longer. The normal we consider between 90% of our products to be within four to eight weeks, and we believe it's going to take us at least till June next year to get there.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the clarification.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Hello, Gil.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Congratulations, again.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","On your normal inventory levels, you used to have 130 days or 120 days. Do you use these numbers now, or you've changed?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So the normal inventory for us would be 115 to 120 days. We may have in the past also said 115 to 125 days when we felt we needed a larger band. We haven't changed the targets. We just cannot seem to get there with the strength of the demand. I mean the growth we had last quarter of 7.7%, for the last several years that was a two years of growth, that we did it in one quarter. So we're basically, it's taking everything we got in growing the capacity, building more units, and then shipping it out the door for revenue. And the inventories are very low. Our inventory is seven-year low right now, and we don't see short term being able to build it.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","All right. Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Hello.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Steve, as you're adding new capacity, do you have an idea of what revenue level can the capacity you've added drive?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, our capacity is being added in small chunks all over the place. You add a furnace here, a handler here, a tester here, a prober here to resolve specific product constraints on specific package types and specific product lines. It's not like we build another $1 billion fab and it takes you from here to there. So the new equipment is arriving every week to two weeks, so it's really more incrementally, serially being added rather than in very, very large chunks to get to some new number. I don't know whether that makes -","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So this is, yeah, this is a better controlled and avoiding a risk of your customers, I guess, putting in orders that -","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah, there is no capacity, there's no risk here of all this capacity then somehow sits idle. Because as soon as the next tester and handler arrives, there's a rush to put it on the floor, qualify it, characterize it and put it in production. Every diffusion tube, every handler, every (58:36) everything is very quickly going to incrementally produce the product, and help to either, three things, help to either reduce the unsupported product, delinquent product to the customer, that's the first priority. Number two, to then really build a little bit of the inventory so that the lead times will come down. We can never get to the second, because largely, and number three to ship for growth. So shipping for growth is number one, the reducing delinquency is number two and building inventory is number three. We're only able to do number one right now, ship for growth.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Hello, Raj.","Operator","Caller, please check your mute function. And with no response, we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more to Microchip 2.0 and, Steve, as you said, it's kind of been a formation over five years. But just anything you're doing from a sales organization, from a distribution, whether it's incentivizing them or education to kind of really see the full benefits of 2.0?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, I happen to have our VP of Sales and Applications, Mitchell Little in the room and I'll give him the unique opportunity to answer that question.","Mitchell R. Little - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, sir. Our compensation system, first of all, we have to recognize our compensation system has never changed. We are the only non-commission sales team in our industry. So we've not changed any of that, we've done basically the same things. We've engaged with our distribution partnerships in just that mode, engaging with them to help them do more of what they're doing. So we've not shifted anything other than shifting our thinking about total system solutions a little more broadly. We're pretty much what we've always been and been successful at.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Steve any commentary, and I know one of the focuses has been kind of Atmel attach and you touched on that in terms of the opportunities. But any other color you can add in terms of the design kind of funnel and what are you seeing on that front?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well like I said, the design win funnel is very, very large. It's almost scary. You never know from a large design-in funnel what is a yield out of that, because customers can always tell you this design is 10 million units, and it turns into a lower amount. We have metrics on that from years of experience what size of the funnel can yield to what kind of growth, so what is the yield out of the funnel.","But with the Microchip 2.0, as some of the input variables are changing, a lot of attach, a lot of ancillary designs around our micro, the whole integration of Atmel, attaching our products to Atmel's microcontroller, I think the yield out of that funnel is a bit less predictable. If the yield is the same as it was before, it's scaringly large, but it's possible that it is a little bit new and therefore the yield could be slightly different. But it's enough good to be very optimistic about what I'm telling you and it's based on data and information. It's not a pipe dream.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey guys. Nice performance on the quarter and also great performance for MCU. Steve, I think you mentioned all those different MCU categories that were up year-on-year. Perhaps you can highlight maybe a few that had upside surprises for you or perhaps some that had faster growth than others.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Ganesh, do you have anything to comment on that?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","No, we don't break out the growth rate of specific microcontroller segments. It works as a collective portfolio. It's very, very strong with a combined portfolio of classic Microchip and Atmel combined. And I think it's winning designs because we've infused energy into the Atmel designs and our historical products have always had strong momentum behind them. But outside of that, we don't have any additional color.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Switching gears then. Steve, looking back on publishing that letter to customers in April, what were the effects that you saw immediately after you published that? Did you guys actually see a marked surge or kind of uptick in orders immediately or would you say that it was kind of just select customers coming in and a smaller percentage of customers that put fresh orders in? How would you describe kind of order trends immediately after publish of that? Was it a big deal or not?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, it was not a big deal. We published the letter on April 4. For some strange reason, investors didn't catch on to it for two weeks. We thought you guys get that in a nanosecond. But we published the letter on the web on April 4. So, I commented on that in our May press release, in the May conference call. We basically did not see any impact. The bookings were extremely strong in the March quarter and after publishing the letter the bookings did not really get any stronger.","The activity that usually takes place is, all of our worldwide sales force takes the letter to our customers and to our distributors and distributors start working with customers to understand their longer-term needs and saying lead times are going longer, so don't only tell me what you need it for this quarter, also tell me what you need for next quarter. Start looking at major products and new designs that may have a substantial ramp coming up, and that information then through distributors and our own people, customer by customer start flowing in into building a demand forecast, and is a more accurate reflection of what we should be building and what we should be planning. And what it results is, and some of it comes into backlog and what it results into is, it increases our ability to build the product in a better mix.","Remember, a large amount of product that we start wafers on, we start wafers on and forecast not always having a backlog today. We start on a forecast and by the time the wafers go through fab, assembly, test, then the backlog will come in on that product to ship it. So, any time you start on a forecast like that, you always have a level of out-of-mix situation where we built a little too much of this, a little too little of that, and the little too much then ships in the following quarter. But it results into some lost sales, because you didn't have the right product. The effect of the letter is really giving us a broader understanding of customers' needs in more exact mix, resulting into an outstanding execution in the correct mix. And its results you saw in the quarter with a very strong growth and continuing strong growth in the coming quarters.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Those are great details. Thank you very much.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions in the queue at this time. And Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, we want to thank all the investors and analysts for attending the call and we'll see some of you during the quarter as we get back out on the investor circuit or conferences in September.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Mr. Sanghi, please go ahead.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our 2 press releases regarding earnings and announcement of the signing of definitive agreement to acquire Standard Microsystems Inc., known as SMSC, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are: Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; Eric Bjornholt, CFO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.","We have 2 back-to-back conference calls today.

In the second call, we will not take any questions about our earnings.","So I will now pass the call to Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's CFO.","J. Eric Bjornholt",",","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump in into details, I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share base compensation, acquisition-related expenses and other nonrecurring events.","Net sales in the March 2012 quarter were $338.9 million, up sequentially 3% from net sales of $329.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and were down 10.8% from net sales of $380 million in the March 2011 quarter. On a geographic basis in the March quarter, revenue in the Americas was up 1.6% sequentially. Europe was up 14.5% sequentially, and Asia was down 0.7% sequentially, and was seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays.","The March quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year in Europe, and this year has followed that pattern. Net sales for fiscal 2012 were $1.383 billion, down 7% from the fiscal 2011 levels.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.1% in the March quarter, an increase from the 56.8% achieved in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.2% of sales in the March quarter. Operating income was 31.9% of sales, and net income was $94.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.45.","In the March quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share was favorably impacted by about $0.01 in the other income area of the income statement from the redemption of a previously written down Auction Rate Security at par value and some favorable foreign exchange hedging activities. We are not forecasting with these favorable items in the other income area of the P&L will repeat in the June 2012 quarter. ","For fiscal 2012, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2%, operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, and operating income was 32.3% of sales. Net income was $383.7 million or $1.89 per diluted share. On a full GAAP basis in the March 2012 quarter, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization were 57.2%. Total operating expenses were $100 million or 29.5% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $8.5 million, $1.5 million in special charges related to a patent license settlement and acquisition-related expenses of $1 million. GAAP net income was $80.6 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.38.","For fiscal 2012, GAAP gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 28.6% of sales, and operating income was 28.7% of sales. GAAP net income was $336.7 million or $1.65 per diluted share.","In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 12.3%. Our tax rate is impacted by a variety of factors, including the mix of geographical profits, and withholding taxes associated with our licensing business.","On a forward-looking basis, we expect our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be 13% to 13.5% and our GAAP effective tax rate to be about 25 basis points lower than that, excluding any discrete onetime events.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the March quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.042, acquisition-related items were about $0.012, the patent license settlement was about $0.007, and the noncash interest expense was about $0.006. ","The dividend declared today of $0.35 per share will be paid on May 31, 2012, to shareholders of record on May 17, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $67.8 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at March 31, 2012, was $217.3 million or 137 days, flat to the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 31 days, which is down 4 days from the prior quarter level. As measured in days, our distributors have the lowest level of inventory that they have held in the last 10 years.","We believe that distributors will need to increase their level of on-hand inventory over the coming quarters. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. ","At March 31, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $170.2 million, an increase of 14% from the balance as of the end of December. The increase in receivables can primarily be attributed to the back-end weighting of shipments in the quarter due to the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia, distributors not reducing inventory as much as they did in the December quarter and the increase in revenue. Receivable balances continue to be in great condition with excellent payment performance from our customers.","As of March 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was a record $1.79 billion and was up about $17 million from the prior quarter levels. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $100 million to $110 million in the June quarter, prior to our dividend payments and any acquisition activity.","Capital spending was $3.9 million in the March quarter and was $62.5 million for fiscal 2012, about $5.5 million less than we communicated in our last earnings call due to the rollover of some of this capital into the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2013 is about $70 million, including the $5.5 million rollover from fiscal '12.","We expect capital expenditures to be about $18 million in the June quarter. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $20.9 million, which was down about $0.5 million from the December quarter. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was $86.4 million. Depreciation expense is projected to be about $20.7 million in the June quarter.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller business was up 5.5% on a sequential basis in the March quarter, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product lines up sequentially.","For fiscal year '12, our microcontroller business was down 8.4% as compared to fiscal year '11 due to the broad-based inventory correction accentuated by the aftereffects of the twin disasters last year, namely the earthquake in Japan, and the flooding in Thailand.","Our 16-bit business was up 19.3% sequentially in the March quarter, as our business recovered sharply from the inventory correction many of our customers went through over the last 3 quarters. For fiscal year '12, our 16-bit business was up 5.9% as compared to fiscal year '11. Despite the broad-based market weakness over the last year, our strong design momentum enabled us to overcome the macro trend and significantly outgrow the market.","After 5 consecutive quarters of targeted double-digit growth, including a 33.7% sequential growth in the December quarter, our 32-bit microcontroller business took a pause in the March quarter as some customers digested the inventory they had built. As a result, the 32-bit business was down 13.7% sequentially, although it was still up 51% from the year-ago quarter.","For fiscal year '12, our 32-bit microcontroller business grew 104.7% as compared to fiscal year '11, the fastest growth of any 32-bit supplier by a long shot. The number of 32-bit customers and volume production grew to 885 as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business.","Moving to development tools. We shipped over 50,400 development tools in the March quarter, a new record for quarterly shipments. Cumulatively, we've now shipped close to 1.3 million development tools. Development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design-in activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers.","Gartner Dataquest just released the general purpose microcontroller market share report for 2011. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain share versus the 8-bit market at large, and versus our nearest competitors. We closed the gap versus the #1 supplier and increased our distance versus the #3 supplier from a year ago.","A year ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at the time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share, to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. We delivered in the first installment of that promise in 2011 with more to come this year.","In the general purpose 16-bit microcontroller market, we were the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2011. While we remain in the #8 spot in 2011 for 16-bit microcontroller, we're well within striking distance of the next 2 spots ahead of us.","In the general purpose 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved from the #19 spot in 2010 to #15 spot in 2011. And once again, we were the fastest-growing 32-bit microcontroller franchise.","Now Gartner Dataquest report is a backward-looking indicator where we are, of course, performing very well. Now let's look -- take a look at the forward-looking indicator.","Within the last month, EE Times released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the segment of the market we serve. We're honored by the overwhelming preference for our solutions and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where many of you have had questions about our choice of core. Our 2011 market results, as well as the 2012 design engineering preference results, echo market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important.","Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 0.7% sequentially and performed well in the current environment. For fiscal year '12, our analog business was down 3.8% as compared to fiscal year '11 due to the broad-based inventory correction, although it has performed considerably better than our peer group of competitors. We remain pleased with the design win momentum our analog business has shown and have a strong pipeline of innovative new products that we will be unveiling over the next year.","Moving to our memory business. This business is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products, and the business was flat on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","Before I hand off to Steve, I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2 smaller tuck-in acquisitions of private companies that we completed in the last 3 months. Both acquisitions are consistent with our overall strategy and aligned with our vision to be the very best embedded control solutions company.","Our first acquisition completed last quarter was a Munich, Germany-based company called Ident, that has developed advanced gesture recognition solutions. Gesture recognition we believe is the next emerging technology in human interface solutions and builds upon our strengths in proximity, touch sense and touchscreen human interface solutions for the embedded market.","Our second acquisition completed 2 weeks ago was a Los Gatos, California-based company called Roving Networks. Roving Networks is an innovator in easy-to-use low-power embedded WiFi and Bluetooth solutions that expands the range of our embedded wireless solutions.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, which I will refer to as March quarter and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2013, which I will refer to as June quarter.","Our March quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during the last earnings call. The March quarter was a transitional quarter for us as we return to growth in revenue, gross margin percentage and profits. We went into this cycle one quarter earlier than most, and we had predicted that we would also come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. The December quarter was a bottom for us and we saw growth in our March quarter.","Just one comment on the Licensing business that Ganesh did not discuss. The Licensing business was down 7.6% sequentially. This business tends to trail the semiconductor industry cycle, and our March quarter results reflects some of the broader weaknesses seen by the industry, with the industry returning to growth as forecasted by foundries and integrated device manufacturers alike. We expect our Licensing business to follow suit. In the interim, we continue to build a strong foundation for future growth, with 2 new significant license agreements signed in the March quarter.","Overall, the March quarter turned out to be in line with our expectations in an otherwise seasonally weak period impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. We grew 3% sequentially in revenue. Our gross margin percentage improved by 133 basis points sequentially. Our operating profit was up by 7.6% sequentially, and operating profit percentage was 31.9% of sales. Not too bad for the transitional quarter and it gets better from here.","I will now provide guidance for the June quarter. Our guidance is based on the recovery continuing to take place from the bottom of December quarter. We expect our net sales in the June quarter to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. We expect another 100 basis points pickup in the non-GAAP gross margin percentage, with the gross margin in the range of 59% to 59.25%. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 26.25% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 32.75% to 33% of sales, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.47 to $0.49 per share.","As you compare our June guidance with our peer group, some other's June guidance may look stronger. But if you compare the results for the March quarter and June guidance as cumulative, our performance is near the top of the growth.","Please keep in mind that individual companies have different end market exposures and distribution sales and recognition policies that can affect the trajectory and timing of their revenue decline and subsequent growth. The industry's distribution inventory is very low. As that inventory is rebuilt, the sell-in companies see the revenue immediately while the sell-through companies like Microchip will see them delayed.  Therefore, our June guidance should be put in perspective based on these factors. ","We still expect to reach 60% gross margin by the end of this fiscal year without the effect of the acquisition announced today. On a longer-term basis, with the low amount of new capital, continuing to shut off all depreciation, a gradual ramp in the production of our factories, as inventories burned off, ongoing die shrinks and other cost reductions, we will start to work the gross margin back up towards the corporate target of about 61% on a non-GAAP basis.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","Finally, the March quarter was our 86th consecutive profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 58.1% and non-GAAP operating profit of 31.9% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors even in the best of times. We feel very positive and confident about the long-term prospects in our business and are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth.","With that, operator, would you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all, Steve, thanks for taking the time and being the first on the -- warning how the industry is going to go [indiscernible] of the recovery. A question for you. As you see bookings, which you commented on the press release as continuing to be good, are there any areas that are kind of fallen behind and if you can comment on what you're seeing regionally, especially in Europe where people are always concerned about declining PMI? So if you can just give some color regionally what you're seeing? I know you don't talk about end market but to the extent that you have any insight on end markets as well, may you can give us some commentary there?","Steve Sanghi","Well, bookings were quite strong last quarter around the world by region, including Europe. Europe was actually up the most last quarter, if you see, and the exact number was...","J. Eric Bjornholt","14.5%.","Steve Sanghi","14.5%. Europe is seasonal in that way. We get most of the growth in Europe in the March quarter and then Europe is seasonally very weak in December quarter and the summer quarter, September and June is kind of so-so. So Europe is very seasonal and we're basically seeing that seasonal trend. And on the top of that, whatever happens in the Eurozone, we certainly will not be immune from that effect, but the business in Europe seems fine right now.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Separately, let me just ask you, are there speculation around MIPS and MIPS going to find and buy and decide that your 32-bit is designed around MIPS. To what extent is that going to be a challenge if they're acquired by a competitor, for example? Would you continue to support that architecture or is it easy for you to switch from MIPS to something else? I'm not sure how that works for you but any comment here on what the future of that company may have with regards to 32-bit architecture would be helpful?","J. Eric Bjornholt","We always don't want to speculate on what is or is not going on there. We have always maintained that the core is not the critical element of what the solution we deliver is. We've always been clear, it's a PIC32, which has a substantial number of other benefits to the customer that define what value it is to them. So if and when whatever plays out, we'll play out our hand at that time. But right now, there's no change in our strategy.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can I just ask, I mean, I know Steve, we're going to talk about SMSC in another call. But as I look at all the small acquisitions you've made, gesture recognition seems a little bit some R&D-intensive, how do you see applying that technology to your target markets, this is implying expansion into high-volume applications that you have typically shied away from? And I ask this because we're looking at gesture recognition as something that we'll use more in consumer devices. So how does this fit in with your strategy when you acquired Hampshire Technology and that was going to be focused on less high-volume areas?","Steve Sanghi","So if you look at history, we have always been able to take this technology and move into the broader market. So when you looked at our touch screen and buttons and sliders and touch focus, you saw how we have built substantial business in appliances, in automotive, in touch panels, in industrial and on and on and those kind of stuff, without really making a very large portion of our business in consumer devices, fast moving, fast life cycles and all that. So similarly, as we acquire these technologies, there's a substantial need for all of these technologies in the broad base of the markets that Microchip serve. and as Microchip continues to get larger and larger and we'll get to talk about the other acquisition in the next hour, there's certainly room for some portion of our business in the high-volume faster markets without really overall disturbing Microchip's margin model. So gesture recognition takes the touch screen experience to the next level. Later on tomorrow, I'm presenting to a communication meeting to Microchip's worldwide employees. And the PC that I'm going to be using, I can wave my head and move the slides forward or backward from a distance. That's the technology I'm going to be using and introducing to our employees, and I will try to do the same thing next time I present to the investors so you can get a feel for that technology.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, on series of acquisitions. I mean, ZeroG, you did acquire ZeroG in embedded wireless and I'm just wondering where Roving fits with regards to ZeroG, does supersede or complement that acquisition? I'm just trying to understand how part of this wireless technology is going to fit into your strategy? That's my last question.","J. Eric Bjornholt","It obviously, complements what we have with ZeroG. ZeroG gave us a much lower end of product that was in the entry-level of where WiFi technologies we're at. We get some higher-end technologies. We have some Bluetooth capabilities now that come to us from Roving, and there's some substantial application expertise that comes with it as well. So all of these continue to build our capabilities in the areas of WiFi and Bluetooth, both of which we believe are ubiquitous and the kinds of building block technologies that are in use in a broad range of applications across the market segments we serve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk broadly about the competitive trends you're seeing in the microcontroller market. I know it's always competitive and there's always pricing pressure. But have you seen any of your competitors be more aggressive, especially on pricing? And do you see any of your competitors kind of struggling to make it in the market currently?","Steve Sanghi","The microcontroller market has lots of different competitors in 8, 16 and 32. There's a long tail of about 20-plus competitors in each of those markets. There are always few people gaining market share. There's never a single person in any time you compare people, one could look faster growing for a period of time than the others, but there are a handful of 4, 5 people gaining market share in many of these markets. But there's a long tail to take market share from and especially Microchip whose business is spread in 70,000 customers, we often gain market share from the tail. And a lot of the investors and analysts focus sometime, tends to be kind of on the top, Atmel, and TI, and Renesas, and STMicro, they're all doing well. And you could compare them all you like. But if you look at the data year after year after year, when we look at our performance versus the industry average shipments, whether you look at SIA, where we overall gained market share last year from 6.5% to 7.5%, or you look at the Dataquest numbers that Ganesh pointed or you look at the EE Times survey in brand preference, we continue to win in every indicator consistently for 20-plus years, looking back and looking forward. Microcontroller market has always been competitive. People come and go. There's nobody bombing that market, destroying the prices, in microcontrollers it just does not work, it's a designmen kind of business. And anybody fading away, you could just look at the ranking, there are plenty people fading away from the bottom.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the geographic color. Can you talk about what's happening in Asia? Clearly, Lunar New Year is a seasonally weak quarter but what -- how do you to expect that to track in the June quarter?","Steve Sanghi","In June quarter, Asia should be very strong. It should be the strongest geography, both separately in China and broader Asia.","Operator","We'll take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I just had a question on the order front. So obviously, with your sell-through accounting, you're not going to pick it up in revenues, so perhaps on the order front, that would be a useful leading indicator. Can you give us a sense of what you think is happening on orders in terms of end demand versus inventory refill driving those for you guys?","Steve Sanghi","So as Eric pointed out, our distribution inventory ended the March quarter with a 10-year low. And it's just inevitable that distribution will replenish some of that inventory this quarter and in the coming quarters. So if anybody's concerned about Microchip's internal inventory being high, and last quarter, it was flat, but there was a substantial reduction last quarter in the distribution inventory. And if distribution had not gone down that much, then our inventory would have dropped. So we always look at the total. On total basis, the inventory dropped. So as the distribution refills it, it will drop Microchip's internal inventory and the distribution is fairly positive going forward. So I think that's the trend. I don't know if that answers your question.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","That's really helpful. And then sometimes, you're able to give us a sense of what your larger customers are doing that you talked directly with versus the distributors. Are you seeing any difference in their behavior right now? Any difference in order patterns?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so our -- what we call direct OEM backlog, the customers that we shipped to directly and not through distribution was up strongly starting in the quarter for this coming quarter.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","And is there any difference between your analog order pattern versus your microcontroller pattern at this point?","Steve Sanghi","Not substantial to report. We don't break it out, but it's not something that pops out. I think we're doing pretty good across the product line.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And if I could squeeze in one last. On the gross margin front, so obviously, that's moving up. Is it primarily utilization or is there mix also that could help gross margin?","Steve Sanghi","It's really a combination of factors. It's a handful of moving parts. This continuously -- depreciation is going down with low capital investment. It's continuously mix is becoming richer as memory business is getting smaller as a portion of the overall and microcontrollers and analog licensing have seen more of a growth. It's the die shrinks and all that kind of stuff, general cost reduction in the industry. As the inventory goes down, the factories have a gradual ramp, although we have not increased the factory utilization yet. From December quarter to March quarter, there was some natural improvement because the holidays and all that were not there. And in the June quarter also, the holidays of early January are not there. So there is some improvement in the factory utilization. So a handful of moving parts. We're talking about 100 basis points improvement with 6 factors probably.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I just want to kind of circle back on JoAnn's question there a little bit as she kind of preempted me. But the 10-year inventory at the -- excuse me, inventory at a 10-year low, with signs of cycle putting in the bottom in the March quarter, I'm just curious what you think was driving that when the cycle was about to turn up? And when do you think those distributors are finally going to put some orders back on you?","Steve Sanghi","The distributors have put the orders on us. So the backlog is much healthier than it was before, and it will continue to strengthen. The bookings are fairly strong, so the backlog is building by the week.","J. Eric Bjornholt","And Brendan, our lead times are very short, have remained short. Some of the strategic inventories that we have built is there. So people have been able to place orders and get them in fairly short period of time.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the other question is you made some comments about your analog. But cumulatively, obviously, it compares very well with your analog peers. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in analog in general as the cycle begins to turn up here in the June quarter?","Steve Sanghi","So I think analog business should do very well in June quarter. I do not want to quantify it, but I think we should have a strong performance in the analog in June quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, I'd just be curious as to your thoughts or impression as to how you think this cycle will play out? I mean, clearly, you guys are undershipping in demand or shipping in demand across some of these [ph]. When do you think we get back to the proper run rate? And what do you think it's going to take to get us back there? Any thoughts on the timing of that?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the cyclic part of the recovery is underway. It's been a classic pattern where we call it first, which we called it back in the June timeframe last year. Everybody jumps in claiming to be an internal Microchip problem. A quarter later, warnings come from everybody and the industry joins. And then the speculation begins, when does the cycle end? Microchip's bottom quarter was December. We called that, too, that we end one quarter early, and that is often questioned. And now, it starts to get believed as that becomes a reality and everybody else called their March quarter as a bottom and then June quarter guidance is up. So it's a very classic pattern. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you should see a number of companies, at least the good companies, making new highs in terms of record revenues, taking out acquisitions and all the economic activities. So I think the pattern is pretty much intact.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you mentioned that you're already seeing distis having to take their inventory up a little bit. So are your bookings from the distributors a little bit stronger than the OEM\/contract manufacturers?","Steve Sanghi","I think our bookings are really strong across the board right now. So -- and it's region by region, so I'd be guessing if I answer that right now.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. And my last question is probably for Eric. You guys are guiding for a nice sequential increase in sales this quarter, but your OpEx looks like it's up about the same amount as sales. Is that because of the 2 small acquisitions you did? And then how are you guys going to get that OpEx down towards the target model as the fiscal year unfolds?","Steve Sanghi","I think -- let me answer that instead of Eric. If you look at our OpEx, it's near the industry best. The industry spends several hundred basis points more than we do on an average basis, we'll be in the top 3, 4 companies, the top echelon. So we have seen a lot of opportunities in the market with these acquisitions and other internal programs, and people get awfully excited about trying to get another 25 basis points leverage. I mean, we just reported 31.9% operating profit and will be higher than that in the June quarter. And when the opportunity is there, if we did not invest in those strategic investments to gain share with these tuck-in acquisitions and internal programs to accelerate various revenue growth, we wouldn't be making over 32% operating profit, a kind of shame on us. That's the real answer.","J. Eric Bjornholt","And I guess, I'll just also point out that our long-term model is 25% to 26%.","Steve Sanghi","Yes. So we're just 25 basis points higher than that, we will be getting in the range as the recovery picks up steam.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, realizing that 32-bit is still a very small portion of the overall microcontroller market. Down this quarter, do you expect to see a resumption of growth in the June quarter? And relative to the 16-bit ramp, is this kind of lumpiness kind of typical as you're starting out a new node?","Steve Sanghi","So I would predict that we will grow in the June quarter in 8, 16, 32, analog, across the board.","J. Eric Bjornholt","I think if you go back and look at the 16-bit by quarter patterns, we haven't had a timeline where occasionally, there's going to be a quarter when there is a decline, and that was there if you go back over to the first 20, 30 quarters of how the 16-bit did, it's not unusual at this stage. But if you look at the consistent longer-term pattern of the growth and you're going to find multiple quarters of growth, and there'll be a pause somewhere along the way.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then guys, as you think about the different segments of microcontrollers, I'm kind of curious, relative to the overall growth in microcontrollers, how do you see 16 versus 32? And I know you're dealing with different basis [indiscernible], but I'm most interested in kind of the 8-bit market and what you think the longer-term growth there is? It seems like the 8-bit downturn starts a little bit earlier than the overall semiconductor downturn?","Steve Sanghi","We have -- in our history, we have really never cared about that. We always look at what our market share is. If our market share is 15% in any given market, then the 85% of the business we don't have. We don't let our people think that this particular market is shrinking or this particular market is growing. If you look at our 20-year performance in the 8-bit market, we have done incredible in the face of the market that analysts have called it for better part of 10 years as not a good market. 16-bit is the same way. Everybody says all the growth is in 32-bit. We have doubled year after year after year in 16-bit and grew again last year significantly. So it's just a different thinking. We don't think in terms of market growth. We think in terms of the opportunities that we can have in growing that market. So if it grows to market share and the market isn't growing, so be it. We don't make the difference.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then Steve, my last question, maybe a bit tangential to the 9:30 call, but the dividend has always been sort of a key part of the Microchip story and you guys have always been very committed to it. Just given the size of the acquisition announced this morning, as I run the numbers, doesn't seem to be any issue with the dividend strategy but I thought I'd just like to hear from you.","Steve Sanghi","So you're correct and the question is valid for this call, too. There will be no change in our dividend strategy, we've got substantial amount of cash and we established a larger credit line last year to really fund this so there's no problem, here. Dividend strategy will continue.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I wonder if you could -- it's a difficult question, given the breadth of your customer line, but give some indication of what you think your customers are doing and end customers are doing with inventory levels right now? Do you -- in terms of how lean those inventories may be and their willingness to perhaps start to do some restocking here, independent of what's happening at the distributors?","Steve Sanghi","So if you look at the direct customers, it's quite clear. As I mentioned, the direct customers backlog started out much stronger and additional bookings are continuing. So we feel pretty good about it. And part of that across the customer base has to be where they're seeing resurgence in their business or the inventory is too low or a combination of both.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. I mean, I guess as a follow-on to that, from a bigger picture perspective, you obviously have a lot of customers but I'm sure you speak a lot of customers, what are they telling you, from a bigger picture standpoint, of their confidence through the rest of the year?","Steve Sanghi","Their businesses are doing better. They have bounced off the bottom. They're more confident that economic cycle is doing better. But they're not happy that the economic cycle is the weakest recovery it's been seen in many, many recessions. The latest slowdown in GDP in the March quarter, which was lower, is not a happy news. So nobody is really pleased with the pace of the recovery, nor are we. But everybody is still seeing growth, at least it has turned positive, and they're doing better than they were doing before.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And just one final. You had talked a bit about what you're doing with your inventories and such. I believe the way that you were managing utilization was taking factory shutdowns, are you planning on continuing the shutdowns into the June quarter?","Steve Sanghi","No, we did not have any shutdown in the March quarter either, although there is some natural shutdown. The New Year holiday kind of goes a little bit into January, early part of January. But there are no more factory shutdowns required because our inventory, when you combine it together with the distribution, it's dropping already.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First question, Steve, Microcontroller business was up 5.5%, which is better. I understand that you're recovering from some natural disaster kind of issues. But I'm curious if there was any one market or 2 markets that stood out that did better than the others? And I'm also curious if you saw increasing strength in orders. In other words, how is the linearity of orders?","Steve Sanghi","So you want to take the Microcontroller, please?","J. Eric Bjornholt","Sure. Our business is very broad-based. There's no specific market that's been driving the resurgence in the growth. It's growth across the board. And I forgot, what was the second question?","Steve Sanghi","Second part question was the linearity of the orders. So basically, the business has continued to strengthen through the March quarter. So bookings, higher and higher every month, and we expect that pattern to continue in April, and then May is just starting so basically, it's a very classic pattern. The bookings are strengthening.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Very good. And as a follow-up, Steve, last decade, this is a strategic question. Microchip, from what I remember covering you guys, was not a very big fan of acquisitions. This sort of decade so far, we've seen a different pattern. And I'm curious if there's a change in the way you guys are thinking about running the business going forward as you get -- are you trying to get more acquisitive? Or is it a function of what you're able to see in the marketplace that's very cheap? Just any thoughts?","Steve Sanghi","Well, kind of thoughtful question. So if you look at -- the question really depends on what you do with your cash. So we produce enormous amount of cash and relatively low capital investment in the business. So the business is very profitable and throws a lot of cash. So we spent the last decade building up our dividend to be near 4%, one of the highest dividend in the semiconductor industry. And that's good, giving -- on the top of that more even is really not helpful. It gets kind of too high and I don't think people start to appreciate beyond that when it's already the highest. So the other is the investment in our own business, where growth in strategic initiatives. There was the earlier question regarding the operating expenses and not as quick to get it down to 25%, 25.5%. There is an opportunity we're investing and we're happy with it, our business is very profitable. But despite giving all this dividend and despite spending 26.25% on operating expenses, slightly higher than the model, we're still building cash. We've got $1.8 billion record cash. So what do we do with it? So we're looking for where we can find acquisitions that can enhance Microchip's available market, maybe to similar customers where we sell their products that go around the board, things that we could package in with Micro where it can really add to strategic initiatives, either in technology, all the market, all the products or all of the above. We didn't have that level of cash in the earlier part of last decade. We were also building our factory infrastructure at that time. If you recall, we spent a couple of hundred million dollars buying our fab floor in Oregon, and subsequently made substantial capital investments for equipment and all that. We built a factory in Thailand and added significant to that. So we were building our infrastructure and spending money internally. All that is now built and we have substantial factory capacity in our factories plus part of the fab-lite strategy where we are doing a portion of the business at the foundries. So business has become less capital-intensive in this decade. And therefore, we are trying to find use for that money and doing it very judiciously. We haven't done a bad acquisition. The record of acquisitions in our industry is terrible and ours is great. Acquisition after acquisition, we are very, very pleased with it. It's adding shareholder value.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. So I should think of your strategy for using cash is basically kind of expanding your product line, expanding your footprint. But that's where you cut off the line, correct?","Steve Sanghi","Yes. I mean, unless there's a fourth element of it and there's capital investment, there is internal growth in operating expenses, growth in operating expenses, we don't like, and 26% versus 26%, I'm not shedding tears. The capital expense, we are spending what we need to spend and it is low because of our strategy. So that is fine. And despite doing all that, we are still building a lot of cash. So therefore, I hold the management at Microchip responsible and you should hold all of us responsible to make sure we don't blow that cash in bad acquisitions, a lot of people did at the height of the 2000 bubble and spending billions of dollars and then writing them off. We haven't done that at all, and we will not do that. And that's our promise to you, that if we do an acquisition, we will deliver tremendous shareholder value.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a short question. Just if development tools are a good indicator of future revenue, can you give a little more of a breakout or at least growth rate of development tools for 32-bit controllers versus 16 or 8?","J. Eric Bjornholt","So our development tools are used across 8s, 16s and 32s. Yes, there are a subset of tools that are unique to 32 only. But there's a much larger number of tools that get used across 8s, 16s and 32s. I think the more meaningful indicators to look at, how are the businesses themselves growing, and if you look at 8s, 16s and 32s, they have continued to outperform the market and the development tools that our customer buys can be used on different projects and today, may help an 8-bit, tomorrow, may help a 16-bit, day after tomorrow, can help a 32-bit. But the fact that they're being purchased and used is a good reflection across our microcontroller portfolio.","Steve Sanghi","I would like to add that a part of the Microchip PIC brand value proposition is that we are the only company where if you buy a development tool, you can use it on our 900 products from 8 to 32. You cannot do that with any other company. Their product lines are disjointed where one is based on this architecture, the other was designed here, the pinouts and peripherals and others are not compatible, they don't match, so you have to buy different tools for different product lines. For Microchip, one tool set will serve the entire base.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess that supports the reason different processors or cores don't really matter as long as the development tools are the same.","Steve Sanghi","Exactly, yes.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's probably a good segue into the call but Steve, to further clarify the acquisition strategy. It seems like you've been opportunistic in the past with the SSTI deal. A lot of the acquisitions have kind of fallen into that elbow out, but Ganesh just mentioned that it seems like you were alluding to the most recent acquisition, SMSC, as one that's more SAM expansion. So is that the right way to think about how you're looking at your acquisition strategy on a go-forward basis?","Steve Sanghi","So since you named the company we're buying, I'd rather take that question in the next call. And if it's not asked, I'll answer it anyway in the call. There are certain rules about filing and all that, so I'd rather not take that in this call.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. On the Licensing business, you mentioned there were 2 deals that were signed in the quarter, in the March quarter that were meaningful. When do those kick in from a revenue standpoint? And will we see them impacting the growth rate of that business or is the cyclical dynamic that you mentioned just really the overriding factor in terms of how we think about the way that business rises and falls over time?","Steve Sanghi","So the new license is depending on what kind of days, whether it's an extension of something, or it's a major license or it's a brand new node and a major foundry. It could have 2 years to revenue. But there are milestone payments in between, there's payments usually at signing of the contract. Some of that we will get this quarter when you make the first package delivery, the technology in our delivery. But then as they start to install it, there's money at various steps. But in the royalty stream, actually, they're couple of years away. But there's a significant revenue in between.","Okay. So with that, we'd like to finish the earnings portion of the call. So all of you have to sign into a different call. There's a different number that was sent out. And for the second call, I'll also be using a slide set, which was posted on the Web as we speak. So make sure you get that slide set.","J. Eric Bjornholt","It will be on the webcast.","Steve Sanghi","It will also be on the webcast. So we'll see many of you on the next call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer.","We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation with end market demand as this is not how we manage our business. As evidence of this uncertainty in recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter.","Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand.","All of Microchip\u2019s bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue earned from fulfilling end market demand. Therefore, along with GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis using revenue based on end market demand and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were 1.217 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 21.4% sequentially from net sales of 1.002 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our Website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%, operating expenses were 23.3% of sales, and operating income was a record 473.5 million and 38.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record 405.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $1.61, which was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.48.","On a GAAP basis, net sales in the June quarter were 1.213 billion, GAAP gross margins were 52.9% and include the impact of 3.6 million of share-based compensation, 107.7 million of acquisition restructuring and acquired inventory evaluation costs, and 3.4 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels.","Total operating expenses were 509.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of 133.7 million, special charges of 40.1 million which includes 15.9 million of share-based compensation, 26.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of 25.8 million. The GAAP net income was 35.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share.","The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '19 and the next several years to be between 3% and 4%, exclusive of a transition tax and any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure.","We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low. The transition tax for the combined Microchip- Microsemi group is expected to be about 364 million, was recorded last fiscal year and will be paid over eight years.","The first transition tax payment was made in July 2018 in the amount of $35 million. We expect payments of about 28 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, 54 million in fiscal year 2024, 72 million in fiscal 2025 and 91 million in fiscal year 2026.","Microchip\u2019s GAAP tax rate in the June quarter was 5.2% and was impacted by the various GAAP purchase accounting adjustments from the Microsemi acquisition and prior acquisitions as well as one-time discrete benefits related to changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2018 was 1.105 billion including 359.7 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had 119 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter.","Our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 40 days compared to 36 days at the end of March. The historical Microchip distributor inventory was actually down by about a day in the June quarter, but the consolidated increase is driven by the high inventory in the Microsemi distribution channel. We expect the Microsemi distribution inventory to reduce through the end of calendar year 2018.","The cash flow from operating activities was 302.4 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was 649.7 million. At June 30, our debt outstanding includes 3.3 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $3 billion of term loan B, $2 billion of high-grade bonds and $4.5 billion of convertible debt.","Our net debt to EBITDA, excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 5.0 at June 30, 2018. Our leverage is higher than we originally projected primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity.","We are fully committed to using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years.","Capital expenditures were 89.4 million in the June 2018 quarter. We expect about 70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about 220 million to 250 million.","We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $38 million.","I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started with the product line discussion, I thought it may be helpful to summarize what we said at our May 31st conference call in regards to our revenue reporting.","Classic Microchip, which is Microchip excluding Microsemi, used to report five product lines; microcontrollers, analog, memory, licensing and finally multi-market and other, what we used to call MMO.","In fiscal year 2018, our revenue of 3.98 billion was split across the five product lines as follows; microcontrollers at 65.8%, analog at 23.9%, memory at 5%, licensing at 2.6% and MMO at 2.6%.","With the addition of Microsemi, we will add a sixth product line category called FPGA. Microsemi\u2019s revenue reporting will be split across four of the six product line categories; in microcontrollers, analog, FPGA and MMO. Microsemi has no memory or licensing product lines and hence the contribution to these categories will be zero.","Directionally, on a combined basis, we expect our analog revenue percentage to tick up while our microcontroller revenue percentage will tick down. That\u2019s exactly what the final results for FQ1 have shown with a partial quarter of Microsemi results included in our overall results.","Now let\u2019s get to the product line performance. On a combined company basis, we performed a little better than we expected in the June quarter with sequential revenue growth of 21.4% as compared to the March quarter.","Microchip, excluding Microsemi, achieved a new record for revenue. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients\u2019 innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions.","Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our microcontroller business, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Microcontroller revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall.","Both 8-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers for classic Microchip set new records. On a combined basis, including Microsemi, our microcontroller business was sequentially up 10.8% as compared to the March quarter.","Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design and funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.","We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018 as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall. And on a combined basis, our analog business was sequentially up 35% as compared to the March quarter.","Moving next to our licensing business, this business was sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the March quarter and up 5.8% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Our memory business was sequentially down 1.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. And finally, our MMO business for Microchip, excluding Microsemi, was down sequentially. However, it was up 63% sequentially when including Microsemi.","On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and a partial quarter of Microsemi, our FQ1 2019 revenue of 1.2 billion was split across the six product lines we report as follows; microcontrollers at 59.9%, analog at 27%, FPGA at 3.4%, memory at 4%, licensing at 2.2% and MMO at 3.5%.","We expect the tick down in microcontroller revenue percentage and tick up in analog revenue percentage will be further extenuated when we announce our FQ2 results in November as we will have a full quarter of Microsemi revenue included in the results.","Now an update on the Microsemi integration and our progress since our May 31st conference call. We made dramatic changes to the top level leadership structure in the first few weeks after the close. Essentially, all of the top leadership are no longer with Microchip. The reasons for this will be more evident after Steve provides you some color in his section.","As we have done in other large acquisitions, we have used our leadership depth and strong pipeline to insert Microchip executive leaders in the top positions to run the Microsemi enterprise.","The business unit restructuring is progressing well. We have retained several of the key Microsemi business unit leaders to continue to run their businesses, while selectively combining some of the smaller businesses where Microchip had similar product lines into the Microchip business unit structure. This eliminates duplicate infrastructure and creates synergy in the process.","We have also restructured some of the less profitable businesses and adjusted their going forward investment levels to be consistent with what is affordable. And we have some more to go.","The sales integration has commenced. We have converted the sales team to a Microchip style non-commission sales team and ended all incentives discount product for quarter end revenue maximization.","Teams from classic Microchip and Microsemi have started to identify and pursue product cross-selling opportunities and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of our combined total solutions approach. Several of the sales office space consolidations have already taken place and many more are in the works.","The normal analysis of effectiveness of channels as well as of each channel partner is underway. One decision we have already made which was announced last week is a refranchising of Avnet, a Microsemi product thus adding more channel bandwidth to sell Microsemi\u2019s products.","The operations integration work has started but it is an enormously complex undertaking as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions had taken place. For example, Microsemi has 21 ERP installations that we need to converge in our business system and operation integration plans.","We expect to have the plan worked out by the end of this month and start working towards specific business system and operational integration goals at that time. However, given the complexity we are seeing, we expect the operational integration will be a two to three-year project.","We\u2019re also performing a detailed analysis of what outsourced operations can be in-sourced as well as evaluating the efficiency and cost effectiveness of Microsemi\u2019s internal factories. Lastly, the normal task of working with the supplier base to find the best cost from either company and applying it to the other is happening as we speak.","In the G&A areas, we have eliminated some of the support organizational cost redundancies. More will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plans.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2019. I will then provide commentary on our first two months at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2019.","Our June quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated net sales came in above the midpoint of our revised guidance that we issued on May 31, 2018 after the closing of the Microsemi transaction.","In discussion with our Board of Directors, the Board wants us to manage as a combined business from day one, not breakout the individual components of Microchip and Microsemi and proceed to integrate the businesses together at a rapid pace. The Board does not want to engage in the old controversy of organic versus inorganic growth and wants to measure us on the overall results achieved.","What we are driving towards is to produce an increasing non-GAAP earnings per share from the combined company. This worked well when we acquired Atmel and it should work well here. Therefore, we will not provide a breakdown of the two businesses other than some useful nuggets of information along the way.","I will refer to Microchip business without Microsemi as classic Microchip. When we include Microsemi, we will call it consolidated. So our classic Microchip\u2019s non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margins were all new records last quarter.","Our overall consolidated non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP EPS were also new records. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.61, $0.13 better than the midpoint of our guidance. $0.05 of this EPS beat came from higher operating profits and the balance $0.08 of the EPS beat came from a much lower tax rate.","Our tax rate guidance was intentionally conservative in the wake of new tax laws and significant uncertainty of the tax rate of the combined company after acquisition of Microsemi. We consider the tax planning for the combined company to be a part of our plan to synergy and had intentionally modeled for it in our synergies planning. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 111th consecutive profitable quarter.","Our inventories at classic Microchip at the end of June 2018 were 119 days which is right at our target of 115 to 120 days. The total inventory, including Microsemi, is cluttered by purchase accounting adjustments where inventory is written up to market value and hence the total inventory indictor is not meaningful.","We have made enormous progress on the manufacturing side by bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. Our lead times are now near normal with the majority of our products having lead times up between four to eight weeks, but scattered issues with certain products continue to cause longer lead times in those products.","Now let us shift gears. I will give you our observation from our first two months at Microsemi. This has been the time when we are able to get access to all the company\u2019s information that we were not able to get before. And this is the time when we discover some of the weaknesses that we have found in other acquisitions like Atmel and Micrel. This is typically the low point in the acquisition. Things usually rapidly improve from here as we go to work to fix things and integrate.","In the case of Microsemi, we found that Microsemi management was extremely aggressive in shipping inventory into the distribution channel. Microsemi\u2019s distributors had about four months of inventory whereas Microchip\u2019s distributors carry about two and a half months of inventory. While we have seen some excess shipments of inventory into the distribution channel in other acquisitions, we have never seen as much excess as we found in the case of Microsemi.","Microsemi also over-shipped into the contract manufacturers by making deals and offering discounts. This excessive distribution in contract manufacturers\u2019 inventory will provide some headwind for revenue for the next couple of quarters. Our trailing EBITDA in the next two quarters of cash generation will also be impacted by needing to correct this inventory for Microsemi products.","While excessive shipments into distribution and contract manufacturers has been the main issue at Microsemi, we also found a culture of excessive extravagance and high spending. The company had millions of dollars of sponsorships in several luxury suites in sports stadiums, luxury private plane travel and generous sponsorships for many conferences, stadiums and other venues that are wastage of shareholders\u2019 money. We are undoing commitments to all such spending.","So what are we doing to clean up excess inventory and other spending? We did not make any deals with the distribution and contract manufacturers or end customers in the month of June to shift excess inventory. As a result, we shipped closed to $100 million less in the month of June than Microsemi ex-management would have shipped. That was nearly half the inventory correction accomplished in a single month. We expect to achieve the balance of the distribution inventory correction in the next two quarters and nearly complete the correction by the end of this calendar year.","Based on high inventory in distribution as well as inside Microsemi, we have substantially cut back on the manufacturing built plan in internal factories as well as foundries and assembly test subcontractors. The vast majority of Microsemi business is subcontracted so we will see a dollar for dollar cash saving which will offset the negative cash impact of \u2013 some of the negative cash impact of inventory correction.","While this may seem disappointing, we have seen such challenges before as the problems of the acquired company become more visible post close. We remain optimistic about the medium and longer-term prospects from the Microsemi acquisition and are not changing our longer-term thesis.","We have high confidence in the $300 million of synergies that we\u2019ve previously communicated. Microsemi has a very good engineering team. We are still very bullish on the Microsemi products, the stickiness of the customers\u2019 pockets and the end market opportunities for the combined company.","Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy underperforming assets and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products and excellent gross margins and we will correct the aggressive distribution and contract manufacturing shipments and high expense culture as we have done before, for example, at Atmel.","Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. In addition to the headwinds I described on Microsemi, there are several small factors that are starting to impact the business. Standalone, none of them will be material but all of them together are causing us to provide a cautious guidance for fiscal second quarter of 2019.","I would describe four reasons. Number one, the lead times in the market for some of the passive components continue to be long. We are seeing push-outs by several customers because they cannot complete the whole kit and hence do not need our devices. Number two, all the talk about tariffs and trade war is making our customers nervous. While it is hard to put your finger on it, it is hurting business confidence which makes people pull back on investments, expansion and capital spending.","A very small portion of products are made in China and even a smaller portion are imported back in U.S. So we are not worried about duties on our products imported into U.S., but we are concerned about our customers\u2019 products imported into U.S. This is based on original July 6th tariff implementation. We are still analyzing the impact of expected August 23 tariff implementation.","There was a quote from one of our sources, one of our customers. \u201cUnited States imposed 25% tariffs on some Chinese goods on July 6. U.S. issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods for the new tariffs. It makes manufacturers conservative in building product due to uncertainty of market demand.\u201d","Third point, we are seeing the impact of not being fully able to ship to ZTE. While the Justice Department is now allowing shipments to ZTE, ZTE is still organizing and figuring out what the real demand is now and if they can assemble the entire build of materials with long lead times on passive components. So despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE.","Number four, Microchip is a supplier to bitcoin mining industry by supplying microcontrollers and powered management products for the power supplies as well as Ethernet controllers. Bitcoin values have crashed. It has lowered the demand for new shipments to the bitcoin industry quite substantially.","With all this commentary, we expect total non-GAAP net revenue in the September quarter to be between 1.474 billion to 1.55 billion. Our best estimate for overall non-GAAP gross margin is between 61.3% and 61.9% of sales, a range wider than normal as we integrate and understand Microsemi as well as deal with the excess inventory in the channel and resultant reduction in the internal factory builds.","We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.6% and 24.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 37.1% and 38.2% of sales. And we expect a non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.65 and $1.83 per share. This includes more than the $0.15 of accretion from Microsemi that we had originally guided to. So you can see that despite a significant headwind on Microsemi\u2019s revenue and cautious guidance, our non-GAAP EPS guidance at the midpoint is well above prior consensus analysts\u2019 estimates.","This reflects our rapid pruning of some underperforming product lines, raising some prices on mature products and significant restructuring already at Microsemi. Our guidance also represents some excellent tax planning resulting in a lower effective cash tax rate. Our synergy assumptions included this tax planning for the combined company. We do expect our financial results to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters as we correct distribution and subcontractor inventories and as we adjust the internal manufacturing based on inventory correction.","But our synergy assumptions for fiscal year '19 and our long-term synergy assumption of $300 million and our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS target of $8 per share have not changed. The target for non-GAAP EPS of $8 per share in fiscal year '21 may in fact seem conservative in light of the progress we have made in integration and a much lower effective cash tax rate. And we expect to exceed the $0.75 accretion guidance that we have provided as the annualized run rate accretion for the first year after close.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide a more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, sir.","Harsh Kumar","Hi. Thanks. Steve, it seems like you guys are going through the normal things when you acquire a company. Steve, I had a quick question for you and a follow up. You mentioned a lot of things that are coming into play; bitcoin, some other stuff, trade wars. I\u2019m curious, does your guidance on the top line take into account obviously the Microsemi inventory clearing, but is there also a slowdown in your organic business or is it mostly all Microsemi that\u2019s being played out in your revenue guide?","Steve Sanghi","We\u2019re not breaking it out but it\u2019s a combination. The bitcoin exposure was on the Microchip side. ZTE exposure was mostly on the Microsemi side. If there is any kind of demand slowdown because of tariffs if the customers would be nervous to drawdown their inventories because they do not know what the tariffs would be to bring the product into U.S., then that would really affect both sides, Microchip as well as Microsemi. So it\u2019s really a combination of it. But a fair amount of correction really is on the Microsemi side.","Harsh Kumar","Got it, Steve. And then for my follow up, your margins in the September guide are slightly lower than your margins what you reported in June. I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s predominantly a function of you guys taking down the Microsemi inventory quite hard down in the channel? And then how do you \u2013 you said you cleared 50% in one month. Do you expect the rest to be cleared evenly or you\u2019re going to come down pretty hard in September again and then sort of ease-off with very little left in December?","Steve Sanghi","So several questions, let\u2019s take the margin first. Microsemi margins are lower than Microchip\u2019s classic margins. Many investors and analysts may have forgotten that Microsemi acquired a company called Vectron back in September, and that company only had a little over 30% gross margin. So that brought the gross margins low, but during all this time, they had been sort of in the acquisition, so they never reported \u2013 Microsemi never reported their March quarter when their margins were impacted by Vectron and prior quarter was some sort of ratio.","Eric Bjornholt","Just to clarify, that acquisition was in the November-December timeframe of 2017, not in September.","Steve Sanghi","Okay, so I stand corrected and that makes my point actually better. So since it was in the November-December timeframe, the first full quarter of the lower Vectron margin would represent itself in the March quarter and March quarter was never reported by Microsemi anyway because they were already in acquisition. So we are seeing lower gross margins of Microsemi. So last quarter was only one month and this quarter we have the entire quarter. So therefore it has a larger impact of the lower gross margin. And this quarter we will also see the impact of substantial reduction of the build rates in the internal factories of Microsemi, but that was the answer on the gross margin side. The other part of your question was --","Eric Bjornholt","Distribution correction --","Steve Sanghi","Distribution correction. So roughly the $100 million less that we shipped was a combination of shipments, lower shipments from distribution to contract manufacturers and also to direct customers because they were essentially equal opportunity making deals with everybody and making \u2013 shipping excess product into every channel. So out of the $100 million a good portion, more than half of that was a correction in distribution. We will see another distribution correction in the September quarter and the December quarter. And right now we are expecting that that will complete the majority of the correction. The largest piece got done last month, in the month of June, and then the September and December will be two roughly equal pieces. And if anything is left after that, it\u2019s kind of a tail, a very, very small portion here and there which will not be meaningful.","Harsh Kumar","Understood. Thanks, Steve and guys and best of luck.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Good afternoon, Steve, thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I just wanted to go back to yours and the Board decision not to kind of break out Microsemi. I think that makes a lot of sense looking several quarters out, especially because you\u2019re so confident in the revenue synergies of this transaction that you included it in the initial synergy targets. But as you kind of think about the June and September quarter, if you can just help me understand the rationale of not telling us what Microsemi was, and to the extent that you\u2019re not, can you help us get some comfort level about how the classic Microchip business is performing relative to peers because in the absence of kind of not being able to do that math, I think it\u2019s pretty easy for some of us to perhaps wrongfully conclude that maybe the core Microchip business just isn\u2019t holding up as well as some of your peers in this environment.","Steve Sanghi","Well, John, I\u2019m not surprised to get that question from you. Really rightly day one, we took our guy who runs our networking business and he took over the Ethernet business and all those products are combined and we\u2019re getting a single forecast from that division. Similarly, the case with our analog products, power management products, and others. I think if you go back to the Atmel scenario, if we had managed the business to look at Atmel\u2019s 8-bit MCUs and Microchip\u2019s 8-bit MCUs and Atmel\u2019s 32-bit MCUs and Microchip\u2019s and [indiscernible] products and automotive and others, we probably wouldn\u2019t have got an as good results in Atmel as we were able to get, because we went at it as it\u2019s really one business, shipped the lowest cost product at the highest ASP, wherever you have the best specs and best product and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing here. We just don\u2019t want to spend and the Board doesn\u2019t want to spend any of company\u2019s energy to do it any other way.","I think the Microchip business was fine and the Microsemi business was fine. One month can\u2019t tell the story because the business was very nonlinear. So even though you\u2019re looking at overall we achieved the numbers and slightly better than the guidance, both pieces were in the range, so basically not a problem. But reporting it is just like a slippery slope than \u2013 honestly, John, what you guys would like is really there are two clean spreadsheets; one and the other and everything adds up and two plus two is equal to 4.00000. And the world is too complex on our side. We got too many moving parts and things are moving too fast and this whole inventory correction got shoved on us from Microsemi that we were not aware of. There was so much inventory and the Board doesn\u2019t want to put the energy on what doesn\u2019t add value in us really driving the business.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Steve. And then you kind of updated or sort of reiterated a lot of the accretion targets around Microsemi. I\u2019m just kind of curious given that there are some concerns about the leverage on the balance sheet relative to this deal, can you just give us an update on how we should think about leverage going forward and how aggressively you\u2019re thinking about taking that leverage down? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Certainly. Eric can point that out to the leverage.","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our leverage on a net basis, excluding a very long dated convertible, was 5.0 at the end of June. We had originally guided that we have about a turn reduction per year. And because of the distribution and inventory correction that we need to make, we think that in that first year we\u2019re going to be somewhere in the 0.75 range in terms of reduction and then get back to the one turn per year. So it\u2019s a little bit slower pace. And absolutely we are focused on deleveraging the balance sheet and using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond the dividend to pay down debt. So it\u2019s a focus area of ours. We know that we have a lot of leverage at this point in time but we\u2019re committed to bring it down.","Steve Sanghi","That reduction from one turn to 0.7 turns is largely because of shortage of the next two quarters. When you look at on the LTM basis a year from now, the September quarter and December quarter are going through substantial inventory correction, there is a shortage of the EBITDA. After that we get back to --","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, guys. Thanks for the details as always.","Steve Sanghi","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First, I know in the past you have evaluated potential divestitures. I wonder in this case if you think that evaluation continues. Is it more or less likely than in the past? You highlight this lower margin Vectron business. Is there anything that you might want to divest? And then I have a follow up, please.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think we always evaluate thing when we buy a company. And as you have seen in our prior acquisition, we have really divested very little. There was a tiny small piece out of the Atmel, there was nothing out of Standard Microsystems, there was nothing out of Micrel, nothing out of Supertex. We look at divesture more driven by it doesn\u2019t fit at all rather than it isn\u2019t performing well or it\u2019s lower margin, because we fix margins. We fix pricing \u2013 increase pricing. We adjust the model mix of the products. We move the product into different set of customers, industrial or automotive and others where the margins maybe higher. We have done that in many, many acquisitions and we\u2019ll do similar things here. The acquired company focus or the reach may be in a certain set of customers and we expand that and improve margins. So, so far we have not found anything we are going to divest but it\u2019s only been a couple of months and that\u2019s not where we are focused on, divesting. We are focused on improving.","William Stein","Thanks. And as a follow up, I just want to make sure I understand the discussion point around having \u2013 Microsemi having stuffed not only the distribution channel but other sort of channels, including it sounds like direct customers as well. And when we marry that up with Microchip\u2019s approach to rev-rec which is sell-through, the reduction in inventory in the channel, that doesn\u2019t actually reduce your non-GAAP revenue, maybe perhaps a shortfall in your outlook on the revenue side is more driven by the reductions in inventory perhaps at contract manufacturing and other direct customers but not what\u2019s going to distribution. Is that the right way to think about it?","Steve Sanghi","Well, good question, very good question. That would be the case if everything was pure. But everything was not pure. They had also \u2013 ex-management has also taken \u2013 every quarter they would take some direct customers and move them to distribution by giving distribution some discounts so they could make a margin on it. And in doing so they will take the next couple of quarters of product for that customer and stuff them into distribution. So therefore you get to recognize higher selling revenue because to the end customer you will only ship 1x. But to the distributor you can give them 1.5x or 2x and they will do some of that every quarter. So there was overall more than couple hundred million dollars of direct accounts had to move to distribution over the last year or so. And you can\u2019t totally put your finger on it, but a lot of that seemed to coincide when it was sort of decided when the company would be sold. There is some timeline you can triangulate to but it\u2019s not something I can really prove.","William Stein","Thanks very much.","Steve Sanghi","Therefore, there is inventory sitting in distribution for the direct customers and those direct customers we are converting them back to direct customers but they won\u2019t be buying anything for a little while until their distribution has cleared out their inventory shipping it to the direct customers.","William Stein","Got it.","Steve Sanghi","Does that make sense to you?","William Stein","Yes, it does help clarify. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next from Raymond James we\u2019ll hear from Chris Caso.","Chris Caso","Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a follow on to the other question. I guess as we look forward, I guess from what I\u2019m hearing you saying is the quarterly revenue that we were seeing from Microsemi at least for the past couple of quarters was inflated if we looked at it on a pure sell-through consumption basis. Is there any way you can give us any help with where the correct run rate should be? I guess suffice it to say it\u2019s lower than what we were seeing reported over the last few quarters.","Steve Sanghi","You\u2019re correct. The revenue reported \u2013 I want to be very clear that there was no fraud involved because the ASC 606 allows you to recognize revenue shipped to distribution at sell-in. Now the question is --","Chris Caso","And so did the prior revenue recognition standard of 605.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, so ordinarily the management team in managing their business will ship it to distribution roughly what distribution ships out and has the distribution inventory grow only by the amount distribution is shipping higher amount in terms of business growing. That\u2019s not really what happened here. Hiding under the revenue recognition that sell-in is a revenue recognition, there were large number of deals made with the distribution. When the inventory got higher and higher, they even offered interest subsidy to the distributor to carry inventory beyond a certain number of months because the distributor wouldn\u2019t want to carry. There\u2019s money tied up. And they will offer interest subsidy. So basically, shipping to distribution was made an art form almost. So yes, the revenue was higher than the real end market demand. Now at this point in time we\u2019re not totally prepared to give you that number. I think it\u2019s not extremely large. It\u2019s in a few-percentage range. But we need to clear out this inventory over the next one or two quarters and ourselves be comfortable with what the run rate is. There will be \u2013 as we clean out this inventory over the next couple of quarters, there will be a larger revenue increase as we head towards the full board shipment because the inventory correction is over. So there will be some attenuation out in time of the growth rate and I think we\u2019ll provide you some guidance over time, but not today.","Chris Caso","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If for my follow up, I can pivot onto the Microchip organic business and understood what you said about those four issues which were impacted revenue as we go into the September quarter. Can you talk to the sustainability of those headwinds? Is this what you would consider to be sort of a short-term issue? Maybe you could speak to the health of \u2013 outside of these four issues that you talked about the health of the remaining business and then what you\u2019re seeing in terms of order rates? Any change in the fundamentals to the business I suppose.","Steve Sanghi","The core Microchip business does not really have any fundamental problem. I think there isn\u2019t anything we\u2019re trying to correct there. I think our issues are on the Microsemi side. But if you take those four points, the lead times on passives you have heard from many other companies, the whole industry is kind of being impacted. We do not know why passive lead times are that long and the growth has not been \u2013 it\u2019s not like businesses have grown 30%, 40% where passives can\u2019t be provided. But there must have been a significant reduction in passive capacity of some kind. So that\u2019s not long lasting. I think as the industry corrects and passive lead times come down, that issue will go away. The tariffs and trade war is beyond our scope of being able to control it or fathom it and we don\u2019t know any more than anybody else does what the effect of that would be. The ZTE situation, Microchip had a fairly small business with ZTE but the overall business \u2013 Microsemi had a larger business but it\u2019s not huge. For the combined company, I can\u2019t give you an exact number but let\u2019s say it\u2019s the order of 1%. Standalone, that wouldn\u2019t be meaningful. That wouldn\u2019t be all that large. You don\u2019t highlight 1% kind of customers. But if there\u2019s a demand destruction \u2013 significant demand destruction and 1 goes to 0.5, then 0.5% change on a sequential basis can be meaningful. And the bitcoin is similar. Bitcoin was on the core Microchip side. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a huge business like it may be at some other companies like NVIDIA or something. For us it was like a 1% type business, but it\u2019s down 70% or more. So standalone, it\u2019s not really very much with all these moving parts you can make up with growth in other segments, but when you combine many of these sectors together and with all the headwinds from Microsemi, we cannot make up for these small components when you add these four together. I don\u2019t know if that helps.","Chris Caso","Yes, it helps. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Steve, just going back to the topic of tariffs and the business confidence, are you seeing any change in terms of order activity that your customers had been placing?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, we are seeing it and order activity \u2013 more than that I think we are seeing it in distribution sell-through in China to those customers. Still a lot of business in China is done through distribution just because \u2013 just logistics and all that. We do business both direct and distribution. We\u2019re seeing it in both channels. The distribution does business with lots and lots of small customers who build stuff, hardware that ships back into U.S. And we have always told you our business consist of long-tail thousands and thousands of \u2013 probably 70,000, 80,000 small customers which can adjust their build rates in real time. They\u2019re very nimble. And when they think \u2013 they don\u2019t really know whether they can pass on this cost to end customer in U.S., whether they are competitive with 25% duty, will this product have a duty or not have a duty, it makes them pull back on their builds. And we\u2019re seeing that impact in sales out from distribution in China.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then on Microsemi, once you get through the inventory correction adjustments over the next couple of quarters, are there any parts of the business that you call out that you see is attractive from a growth perspective or have a better outlook once you get passed these issues?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we like lots of different businesses. They have very good FPGA business, they have very good business in the data center, they have very, very good business in analog, discrete, aerospace and defense. And then their certain businesses may be not as great. I mentioned one that the electronics business they bought. We don\u2019t know why they bought that. We have some \u2013 that was a low margin business and Microchip would not have bought it. But yes, there are a number of good businesses. What attracted us to Microsemi in the first place really hasn\u2019t changed. We had not imagined the seven months of inventory correction and crisis that we had to go through, but fundamentally we\u2019re seeing fiscal year '21 guidance that we gave you on $8 per share is now conservative. This year \u2013 we said by the end of this fiscal year we\u2019ll be producing $0.75 of accretion. We think that is conservative.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And next we have Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. On the CapEx guidance, it seems the second half of the year the CapEx comes down quite a bit to maybe 2.5% of revenue or so. Is that going to be the run rate going forward or is that just a temporary adjustment?","Eric Bjornholt","I would say longer term, Kevin, probably a good estimate to use is 4% of revenue. We need to continue to evaluate the Microsemi business and see with the investments there. Obviously we\u2019ll be looking to see if there is ways that we can improve the margin on their products by making investments like we\u2019ve done in other acquisitions and investing in assembly and test and bringing activities in-house. So I think that\u2019s kind of the swing factor there. But we were more heavily weighted in the frontend of fiscal '19 from a CapEx perspective.","Kevin Cassidy","And that heavily weighted those products you were targeting, certain long lead times. So as all your lead times, you feel like you\u2019ve got the equipment in place to correct that?","Eric Bjornholt","Our lead times are in very good condition at this point in time. I think Steve mentioned that the majority of our products have lead times with four to eight weeks. And there\u2019s always some exceptions to that and we\u2019re making the proper investments to correct all of our lead times to the right level.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Chris, go ahead.","Christopher Danely","Can you hear me?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, Chris, go ahead.","Christopher Danely","Sorry, wrong mute button, fat fingers. Danely here. So just a couple of clarifications. So Steve, it sounds like the headwinds from Microchip and Microsemi are going to last a couple of quarters. I guess conceptually, how big of an impact should we be thinking about into the December and March quarters would it be? And then what gives you confidence that revenue should bottom in the March quarter? And then do you think that at least the slowdown you\u2019re seeing on I guess the classic Microchip business, would you expect this to hit others in the space?","Steve Sanghi","Well, to the last question I don\u2019t have any comment. For others, ask the others. We don\u2019t comment on the industry, we comment only on ourselves. In terms of the inventory correction, inventory correction we can somewhat control because we\u2019re working with distribution and contract manufacturers and end customers moving the end customers back from distribution to direct which will erroneously transfer to distribution and should not have been. And that we know complete sometime in the calendar fourth quarter. And to distribution, we are monitoring very, very carefully shipping less product to them. With the distribution, they didn\u2019t want all this inventory. So in the month of June, we simply didn\u2019t offer them any discounts and they didn\u2019t take the inventory. You don\u2019t have to do much. You just run the business, distribution buy what you need and it will get corrected by the end of the year. You don\u2019t have to do much in that case because inventory was jammed through incentives and discounts and to smaller distributors even threatening. You don\u2019t do any of that, inventory would correct. So we have high confidence that the inventory corrects. That\u2019s not an issue. The impact of tariffs nobody can call. We really don\u2019t know what happens in the trade war area. The passive components issue I think should go away because capacity is being added. I think that should go away. ZTE is temporary. ZTE will get its act together and figure out what the real demand is, what demand they have lost of their competitors. And the bitcoin is anybody\u2019s guess. It\u2019s not a huge portion of our business over a long period of time. For $1.5 billion roughly per quarter, 1%, we\u2019re talking about $15 million a quarter. So it\u2019s really not a huge, huge portion of the business and we don\u2019t know whether bitcoin comes back to its old glory or not. So I think the main issue is the inventory correction one. That gets corrected in six months and then tariff one is not clear.","Christopher Danely","Thanks. I guess one last quick one before I leave. Were these guys worse than Atmel in terms of the shenanigans they were pulling out there? You guys corralled the Atmel stuff pretty handedly. Is this a similar situation or is it worse?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I\u2019m not willing to accuse anything. I just think the accounting standing is wrong. And we have been seeing it from the beginning and we have already been in position to taper on it when the accounting standard was changed for its sell-in. All you need is a willing distributor or a set of distributors who are willing to take increasing amount of inventory which will ship out eventually some day. There are products in distribution from Microsemi that will take two years to clear. It\u2019s not a huge amount like we\u2019re seeing the majority of it will clear by the end of the year, but there are certain products every quarter they will take certain products, older products and slate them as end of life. Then they will build three, four years of inventory and give it to a distributor and recognize it for revenue in the current quarter. And next quarter do it with some more products. And standard allows it. Since it\u2019s nonreturnable by the distributor, you gave them at a deep discount and you gave them interest subsidy so the distributor is willing to carry it. They will eventually ship it. The standard allows you to recognize it for revenue. So they didn\u2019t do anything illegal. But the issue is they represented to us, to their own analysts before, to their customers or to the investors and everybody else that there was an end run rate. And legally there was a run rate because it will continue to do this for I don\u2019t know how long, until some day it burst. That\u2019s not how we do it. We have never stuffed the channel in our life. We have always recognized revenue on sell-through even though now GAAP standard says you have to account for sell-in, we are giving you that GAAP number but we\u2019d give no GAAP guidance. We manage our business on sell-through. All our incentives are based on sell-through. So I\u2019d just say \u2013 that\u2019s really what happened. They did what they were allowed to do.","Christopher Danely","Okay. Thanks a lot for all the clarifications, Steve.","Operator","Our next question will come from Krysten Sciacca with Nomura\/Instinet.","Krysten Sciacca","Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just a different take on the revenues for the second half of this fiscal year. So on prior calls you\u2019ve noted that December and March typically tend to be the softer quarters seasonally with December being the weakest. Given the inventory issues that you are having with Microsemi, are you expecting any changes to the seasonality or do you expect this to still be the case?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we expect that still to be the case. But what you start to see is really certain products inventory corrects. It doesn\u2019t all correct in one day. Certain products have high inventory, certain products have low inventory and every month certain products inventory corrects. So their run rate returns back to normal. So you got lots of moving parts where you should see an ordinary kind of December weak quarter to the extent certain products inventory has corrected, those see an uplift. So I think driven by all those, we should just see a normal low-single digit down kind of December quarter. I think that\u2019s usually what we see.","Eric Bjornholt","I think in all our acquisitions in the past as well, seasonality \u2013 the blended seasonality will adjust and it will take some time before all that settles out. So I don\u2019t think a historical seasonality would be an accurate predictor of future seasonality when there are acquisitions with different seasonality and different blending taking place.","Krysten Sciacca","Understood. Thanks for the detail. And then on a more positive note, can you just maybe detail what was behind some of the strong growth in analog and in your microcontroller segment for classic Microchip this quarter?","Ganesh Moorthy","If you\u2019re asking for segments of growth, we don\u2019t breakout any of the segments. Those businesses have been in a long-term growth mode. We have shared with you what we have been doing with Microchip 2.0 with the total system solutions. You have to note though that some of the growth this quarter that we\u2019re showing sequentially is a combined company growth and so reflects some of the addition of Microsemi in those numbers. We haven\u2019t broken out the classic Microchip microcontrollers or analog other than to give you some comfort that they both hit records, they both grew more than classic Microchip as an average so that you can see the underlying strength in those businesses.","Steve Sanghi","I would say some of the questions are overly focused on just the shortfall in revenue guidance. Nobody has mentioned that the earnings guidance is $0.07 better than consensus. I think the old consensus was $1.67 to $1.68 and the midpoint we\u2019re guiding $1.74. So we\u2019re doing very well actually. We\u2019re increasing our assessment of the overall earnings for the year and going out of the year, the accretion we can get. So I think look at the glass also half full. And we at the end of the day deliver non-GAAP earnings per share increasing amount. That is our goal. That\u2019s where all our incentives are built on. That\u2019s what the Board manages us by. And even the EBITDA doesn\u2019t give you the credit for a lower tax rate. If the earnings per share are better for a given share count, that\u2019s creating higher amount of total profit after tax. So we feel pretty good about where we are and how we executed the quarter, how we are carrying out the integration. The issues and challenges we\u2019ve seen in inventory correction, just straightforward. They are flexible. It\u2019s not like we need to device a tool or do some invention. There are just the normal blocking and tackling to correct this. But otherwise, earnings per share are great.","Krysten Sciacca","Great. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I understand product line rationalization is kind of taking a second priority to some of the more structural changes you\u2019re making in terms of business process improvements at Microsemi. But if I look at Microsemi\u2019s data center storage and OTN optical product lines, these are very different products; leading edge silicon, leading edge packaging, big, complex chip designs. Very different versus Microchip\u2019s focus on classic, embedded microcontroller, analog, memory and all the other complementary building blocks around this. So help me understand how the storage and the OTN optical stuff kind of fits into the Microchip 2.0 model?","Ganesh Moorthy","So they are standalone businesses. You\u2019re right. They do have more leading edge process technologies and design technologies and packaging in many cases that they use. But that\u2019s not different from when we went to SMSC five years ago, six years ago, in the acquisition. It brought a new degree of complexity. We adapt to it. It fits within the overall portfolio. We find the strengths that the acquired entity has and bring it into the rest of Microchip. We find the strength that Microchip has and take it back to the acquired businesses. And on a blended basis, if we don\u2019t get out of our box, our growth opportunity is unlimited. So, of course, new product lines will bring new complexity but they also bring lots of opportunity to use the strengths of both companies and that\u2019s the way we look at it and how we go forward. And in these two businesses, in specific, there\u2019s also a substantial amount of Microchip classic content available to us to take into those markets where they have significant strength, customer presence and visibility into what else is needed. And in fact, some of the reference designs I talked about, where the joint sales teams have looked at, that\u2019s coming from the joint teams looking and saying, wow, here\u2019s things Microchip didn\u2019t know could be done added to things that Microsemi does extremely well in certain applications and certain customers.","Steve Sanghi","I tell you guys after every acquisition that don\u2019t underestimate, don\u2019t undersell Microchip management\u2019s ability to transform the company to take on the challenges that the new acquisition presents. In Standard Microsystems, the complaint was they\u2019re vertical, you\u2019re horizontal. Look at how well that thing has worked out. In the case of Atmel, they\u2019re ARM and you\u2019re MPS and all that. Look at how well that thing has worked out. So don\u2019t underestimate Microchip\u2019s ability and the management team and huge pipeline we have built internally that we prepare for this to take on the new challenges and expand our business. We\u2019re about the eighth largest U.S. semiconductor market cab in a consolidating industry. You can\u2019t just be sitting in your box and want everything to come with a nice bowtie, only microcontroller. We have to get into other businesses and grow our business in a consolidating industry.","Ganesh Moorthy","And it reinforces Steve\u2019s point earlier that as we move forward, we focus on the combined company opportunities, rather than trying to box it and saying, well, let\u2019s make the old one look good or the new one look good. It\u2019s really the combined company opportunities that provide the richest forward-looking opportunities.","Steve Sanghi","A number of our business units are planning to leapfrog the lithography at the foundries by skip one generation and leapfrog because that leapfrog technology has already been used by Microsemi in some of the same business units that you\u2019re mentioning with library available, with experience available, with EST structures and chip designs and all that kind of stuff available. It will accelerate our roadmap and leapfrog the technology to be able to reuse some of that stuff at Microchip. So I think that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. The ship is very safe in the harbor but that\u2019s not why ships are made for. We can\u2019t sit in our box and just look for everything to be a neat little microcontroller. We have to branch out and be able to expand our business and we have done successfully that in the last decade.","Harlan Sur","Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the great insights.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","Next from Darphil, we have Gil Alexandre. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Sanghi","Hello, Gil.","Gilbert Alexandre","Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll get back to tariffs. Is there a willingness to compromise and how is it affecting your automotive business?","Steve Sanghi","Well, is there a willingness to compromise? Compromise by who? That compromise has to be between the Chinese and U.S. authorities and that\u2019s way above my pay grade. That\u2019s not \u2013 in terms of the automotive business, I think our automotive business \u2013 I don\u2019t think our automotive business has yet been affected by tariffs.","Ganesh Moorthy","No. I think some of the uncertainties are there. Cars are built in the U.S. and shipped to other parts of the world. Cars are built in Europe and shipped into the U.S. And some of the discussions have created uncertainty. We\u2019ll see how it all plays out. But I think Steve\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a current impact.","Steve Sanghi","So far automobiles are not included in the tariffs. Steel and all that are, but the built automobiles are not included. It\u2019s still in negotiation. So when they had an edict on July 6 and then August 23, a set of products that have tariffs, washers and dryers and those things are included. Cars are not. Cars are not dutiable right now. Some of the car components are like steel. So this thing is still raw. Thank you for your question, Gil.","Gilbert Alexandre","I thank you and good luck.","Steve Sanghi","Yes. Thank you. Anybody else, operator?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.","Christopher Rolland","Hi, guys. I think it\u2019s nice to see you guys get out in front of this in the true Microchip way. I think it\u2019s appreciated by guys who have known your track record. So, Steve, as we try to judge this snapback in revenue, once you work through this inventory, can you give us some perspective of perhaps how long this over-shipment issue was going on for? Was it just the last few quarters when they knew that they were in negotiations or was this accumulated over a couple of years?","Steve Sanghi","Well, there are a lot of moving parts and you can\u2019t put a complete finger on it because there is some EOL mechanism with which they put the distribution inventory. Normal amount of inventory was very high. There was a huge nonlinearity. A lot of stuff was shipped undetermined. There was also this direct to distribution conversion. So there were a lot of these programs inter-layered. And I\u2019m not accusing anything but I\u2019m just saying that the timing, roughly it all started about a year or so ago which is more like when the conversations about the acquisition began. But I couldn\u2019t prove that. I think it\u2019s very, very rough.","Christopher Rolland","Yes, sounds pretty common in a lot of these deals. And then lastly, on Microsemi\u2019s product pricing. After the Atmel deal, you saw a lot of kind of pricing imbalances. I can\u2019t remember. Maybe they were selling some below gross profit, if I remember right, or priced it below gross profit. Are you seeing anything like that here and just any other tidbits on where you get more synergies?","Steve Sanghi","I think on that, think I will give kudos to the sales and marketing team. The prices are not below market or anything like that. But when they got an excellent price for a customer, then they inserted a distributor and kept the customer price the same and then they discounted to the distributor, gave an interest subsidy to carry the inventory. After a good price negotiated with the customer, they asked the customer to take much more inventory than the customer wanted and offered them a discount. So I think the pricing by marketing was done well. But then later on in the overzealous attempt to really recognize higher revenue, they kind of did their own thing on the top of that. So this one is easier to correct. It\u2019s much harder to raise prices on the customer. It\u2019s much easier simply not to offer the discount and say, just buy what you need, customer. I don\u2019t want you to buy a lot of product that you don\u2019t need. So we think this one is easier for us to correct that way.","Ganesh Moorthy","And the high starting gross margins are a good indicator of how that was far better disciplined than other acquisitions we\u2019ve done. And hopefully there\u2019s some upside from the discounting being rolled off that we\u2019ll see in the coming quarters.","Christopher Rolland","Yes, good point. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll hear from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question. And Steve and team, thanks for all the color on where you see things shaking out at this point of the integration. Steve, I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made in the Q&A regarding the deal\u2019s accretion in the current quarter. I think you said your synergies are tracking above the prior expectation for $0.15 of accretion. And if I heard that correctly, the question is does that mean that while retaining longer-term accretion targets, $0.75 run rate first full year, $8 a couple years out, that you\u2019re realizing your synergies earlier but you still have the same expectation, or do you think you\u2019re tracking above prior expectations? And to the extent that\u2019s the case, can you identify where you think that is?","Steve Sanghi","So a little bit of both. So I said that we believe that the accretion run rate at the end of the first year will be higher than $0.75. We didn\u2019t numerically say what the number is because there is still \u2013 like I said, the numbers are going to be noisy here for the next couple of quarters because there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts. But as we get out by June next year, we see a number higher than $0.75, which will represent really a little bit of pull-in based on our prior plan. Now in terms of $8 for fiscal year '21, we see that as conservative also. Internally, we\u2019re modeling a number higher than $8. So that is the incremental accretion. I think some of that difference is coming from tax rate, lower tax rate also.","Craig Ellis","That\u2019s helpful. And then previously the company and on this call, the company had identified the 300 million in synergies targets. When do you think you\u2019ll be able to provide some color on how that breaks out between revenue synergies, COGS synergies and other synergies?","Steve Sanghi","Really never. We\u2019re just going to deliver it, never going to break it out.","Craig Ellis","Okay. Given that quick response, can I take a swing at another one? There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on what you found with distribution and I\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about levels and what happened with shipments. But the question is really an operational one. What have you found with respect to the appropriateness of the consignment versus demand generation distribution, geographic representation, and the degree to which you think you\u2019ve got a good distribution fit for the business that exists there? And how long does it take to right-size any of the operational changes that are needed with distribution?","Steve Sanghi","So as we have interfaced with a lot of the distributors, some of them by the way, a fair number of them are common with Microchip. Their largest distributor was Arrow Electronics and our largest distributor is Arrow Electronics. And similarly there are some other common distributors in Asia and Japan and Europe and others. A large amount of interaction with the distributors was how much inventory they would take. It basically began around the middle of the quarter and large amount of I would say tension with the distributor was largely how much inventory would you take. And so as we have spoken with the distributors, distributors feel refreshed and saying that you\u2019re not going to force me to take inventory I never wanted. You will in fact let me drain down my inventory. And so we can have a conversation about demand creation, reference design, how can we together build the business, let\u2019s go call on common customers, let\u2019s highlight and beef up the Web site and put reference designs and solutions on it. How do we take advantage of Total Systems Solution, Microchip and Microsemi common products going into the same platform, on and on and on? So conversations with distributors have turned into positive interactions regarding growing the business. And before that \u2013 and this distributors are telling us. The ex-management of Microsemi is gone. Distributors are telling us that this tension about such a large amount of inventory jamming took all the oxygen out of the room. It just consumed the entire energy and interaction with the distributors.","Ganesh Moorthy","And it\u2019s actually liberated time within the company as well because the business units and others that were all part of that discussion process.","Craig Ellis","When do you start to see a positive benefit from this new conversation that\u2019s occurring?","Steve Sanghi","You will start to see it as \u2013 if inventory bleeds out by the end of this calendar year, you\u2019ll start to see the impact starting in the March quarter. So if you\u2019re talking about getting brand new designs in production, that usually takes 12 to 18 months. But you\u2019ll start to see impact on the funnel, impact on joint opportunities, probably as early as late this quarter.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for the insight, Steve.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Thank you. Hi. How are you? Just switching to earnings, as you noted, Eric, what is the deleveraging campaign? Is that changing at all given the situation? And as part of the $8 per share in fiscal year '21, how much of that is related to a lower interest reduction related to deleveraging? Just wondered if you could talk about that in the grand scheme of earnings being the end to be all of everything?","Eric Bjornholt","So the deleveraging approach is essentially all cash generation above and beyond the dividend is going to go to pay down debt. We aren\u2019t going to do anything unnatural. We\u2019re not going to push inventory into the distribution channel to generate cash and things like that.","Steve Sanghi","We\u2019re not going to cut the dividend.","Eric Bjornholt","We\u2019re going to run the business, going to get our synergies as quickly as we can and with that generate cash to pay it down. And so we are definitely a little bit behind schedule to start and we\u2019ve got a little bit of a headwind in front of us. But long-term cash generation and operating profit generation from these businesses combined is very high. No real change in that long-term outlook. So hopefully that answers your question. And then obviously, as we pay down debt, there\u2019s interest expense reduction. That\u2019s built into our forecast but we aren\u2019t going to give any real details in terms of how that lays out quarter-by-quarter at this time.","Steve Sanghi","One of his questions was really what portion of our incremental to possibly $8 is tax-related? Rajeev, what I would say is that in the past when R&D tax credit used to go away every year and then used to come back later in the year, most companies will have a much lower tax rate in the fourth quarter and then they\u2019ll true up and have a much lower tax rate and sometimes make up the earnings miss with that tax rate and all that. And analysts and investors will discount the additional earnings per share coming by the tax rate. This is not that kind. This is real tax rate current quarter. There is nothing we\u2019re taking from the past to our future. This is actual good old tax planning which for the next several years we\u2019ll have a very low tax rate. So you should look at that as it\u2019s no better or worse than earnings per share produced from higher gross margin or higher revenue or lower expenses or anything else.","Rajvindra Gill","No, that\u2019s true. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what it is. And last question, Steve, I know it might be difficult to understand the tariffs, but in late 2014, you saw a slowdown in China industrial, you saw a slowdown in China housing. You were one of the first ones to note that. And then we did see a slowdown in China in 2015. I\u2019m just wondering is that a scenario that could repeat itself, or just any general thoughts on that? Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","Rajeev, I resigned from that job back in 2014. I would let those jobs be yours rather than mine. I\u2019ll just talk about our business. I get no benefit from that. I\u2019ll let you guys decode that.","Rajvindra Gill","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Eric. Eric, in the trailing previous four quarters, free cash flow tracked pretty close to the non-GAAP net income. This quarter, there\u2019s a little bit more of a gap and I think that\u2019s typical when you start integration process. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of when does the free cash flow start to track back to the net income, if you could give us any help on that, I\u2019d appreciate it? Thank you.","Eric Bjornholt","I think we had a big correction in June as we\u2019ve kind of talked about. I think it continues through the end of the calendar year to have a little bit of pressure on that because of the continued reduction that we expect in distribution inventory. But after that, I think it should return to a more normalized basis.","Mark Lipacis","Fair enough. Thank you.","Eric Bjornholt","Welcome.","Operator","And as that was our final question, gentlemen, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for final comments.","Steve Sanghi","Well, we want to thank everyone for attending this call. We\u2019ll see some of you on the road at conferences, which I think begin again late August and September. So thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to press our release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operation.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2014 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales in the June quarter were a record $462.8 million and were up 7.6% sequentially from net sales of $430.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $300.3 million for microcontrollers, $103.2 million for analog, $34 million for memory and $22.5 million for licensing, and $2.8 million of other. Revenue by geography was $86.9 million in the Americas, $101.2 million in Europe and $274.6 million in Asia.","I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58% from the June quarter and above the high end of our upwardly revised guidance provided on June 3 of 57.25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 30.5% of sales, and net income was a record at $120.4 million.","This resulted in earnings of $0.57 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the mid-point of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.05 above the mid-point of our original guidance.","On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 57.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $168.2 million or 36.3% of sales, and include acquisition, intangible amortization and special charges totaling $29.4 million and also include share-based compensation of $10.7 million. The GAAP net income was $78.6 million or $0.37 per diluted share.","In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.1% and the GAAP tax rate was 13%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items.","Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.138, share-based compensation was about $0.053 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006.","The dividend declared today at $0.354 per share will be paid on September 4, 2013, to shareholders of record on August 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will approximately be $70 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 44th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made a reduction in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 38th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid is over $2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2013, was $256.1 million or 119 days. The mix of our inventory between internally produced and externally sourced product is in better alignment than it was at the end of March, and our inventory position is within our target model.","We expect days of inventory at the end of September quarter to be relatively flat to the June quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days during the June quarter to 32 days and remain at very low levels compared to where they have been historically.","I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At June 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance increased to $232.3 million, driven by the increases in quarterly revenue and the inventory build by our distributors. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.","We had strong free cash flow generation in the June quarter of $138.9 million prior to our dividend payment. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.9 billion, and we had $610 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit.","","Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the September quarter.","During the June quarter, we executed a new $2 billion revolving credit facility that has a 5-year term. The new facility replaces the $750 million facility that was previously in place. The new facility provides us with additional flexibility to pursue our business objectives with minimal immediate income statement impact based on our current level of borrowing activity.","Capital spending was approximately $27.8 million for the June quarter and included rollover capital from the March quarter and a $12.5 million R&D building purchase in India. We expect about $27 million in capital spending in the September quarter. We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2014 to be about $90 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of our business. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $21.4 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines in the June quarter.","Our microcontroller business grew a strong 8.9% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve an all-time record of $300.3 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 24.8% versus the year-ago quarter. All 3 microcontroller segments grew significantly, with 16-bit and 32-bit achieving new records and 8-bit within a hair's breadth of achieving a new record. We fully expect that 8-bit microcontrollers will set a new record in the September quarter.","Microcontrollers represented 64.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. And in April, we shipped our 12 billionth cumulative microcontroller. Additionally, we shipped a record number of development systems in the June quarter, which bodes well for future growth.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 10.1% sequentially in the June quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 71.7% versus the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we're offering, customers that we are serving and applications that we're winning, as we continue to gain market share in this segment.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 26.3% sequentially in the June quarter, coming back strong after a pause in the March quarter to set a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 362% over the year-ago quarter. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Despite the questions that some analysts have had about our choice of core, our consistent growth provides market confirmation of our belief that what customers care most about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important.","Moving to our analog business. Our analog business grew 6.2% sequentially in the June quarter to also achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 119% versus the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue represented 22.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. And at a $413 million annual sales run rate, it has quietly become one of the larger analog franchises in the industry. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E2PROM memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was up 3.7% sequentially. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business was down to 7.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter.","With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2014.","We were very pleased with our execution in the June quarter. In early June, we raised our guidance from what we had provided in our earnings conference call in May. Our actual net sales exceeded even the higher end of our revised guidance. The gross margin percentage was 163 basis points better than March quarter and exceeded the high end of our revised guidance by 78 basis points, as we increased factory output to meet the increased sales.","Our operating profit percentage once again exceeded 30%, and we are making good progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share also exceeded the high end of our revised guidance and meet our original guidance by $0.05 per share.","We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales, microcontroller net sales and analog net sales all achieved new records. Individually, 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers also achieved new all-time records.","Our 8-bit microcontroller revenue came within 3% of its all-time high, further validating what we have been saying, which is that our 8-bit microcontroller business is very healthy, growing and very profitable. Our 8-bit MCU business is continuing to gain share from competitors, who have either moved away from 8-bit or otherwise are uncompetitive and cannot make money in the 8-bit MCU. We are also continuing to gain market share in 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog.","I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an excellent quarter in every respect.","Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 91st consecutive profitable quarter. Regarding SMSC, I would like to comment that for the June quarter, the SMSC division delivered an impressive $0.10 accretion, which was in the high end of our $0.09 to $0.10 range that we have provided. The accretion was up from $0.085 in the March quarter. SMSC's operating profit in the June quarter was about 27% of sales, up from 12% in the last full year prior to the acquisition.","SMSC businesses are now very well integrated and intertwined with Microchip, and that breaking out of the numbers is increasingly difficult and not worth the effort. Therefore, this is the last time we will comment on it by saying that we have more than delivered on the promise of SMSC acquisition and there is more to come from the longer-term synergies in manufacturing on the cost side and revenue on the sales side.","Near the beginning of the month of June, we completely reversed the rotating time-off in our factories and recalled all employees to full-time work. During last month, we also reversed the pay cut of over 2,500 employees, who had volunteered for a 5% pay cut last November. These employees also received an extra bonus last quarter as a shared reward for their shared sacrifice. This continues to exemplify the strength and uniqueness of our Microchip culture. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2014.","We have continued to see very strong bookings and expedite requests in our business driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline. The book-to-bill ratio was strongly positive in the June quarter. The starting backlog for September quarter was significantly higher than the starting backlog for the June quarter. However, we continue to have lead time challenges, mainly driven by longer lead time from our foundries. We are getting good visibility from our customers, but many new bookings will still be scheduled to be around the end of this quarter.","Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the September quarter to be up between 2% and 6% sequentially. Several investors and analysts have asked to -- what explains significant growth that Microchip business has experienced in the last 2 quarters and going into the current quarter? The answer lies in which sectors Microchip does business.","In the last calendar year, smartphones and tablets were very strong, while the other sectors were struggling in a weak economy. This year, the smartphone sector is weak, as evidenced by reports of several semiconductor companies with strong exposure to that market. This year, the strong sectors are housing, industrial and automotive, the 3 sectors that Microchip has very strong exposure to.","While we do not break out our business by these sectors, just looking at some sample customers, we see significant strength in customers that sell products for housing, industrial and automotive. We believe that in general, investors and analysts may have overlooked Microchip's outside exposure to these markets.","Our internal inventory is now fully corrected, and we are ramping our fabs, as well as back-end facilities, to meet the increased demand. Last quarter, our finished goods inventory went down significantly, as we shipped products into strong demand. Our facilities have now switched from lowering finished goods inventory to rebuilding finished goods stock to reduce lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.1% to 58.7% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 30.6% to 31.7% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 and $0.62 per share.","Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus\/minus 0.5%, operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%, and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus, 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP.","This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp.","With this, Angela, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Christopher Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess with -- I'll start with a high-level question, and I understand your comments with regard to some of the strengths in some of the broader segments, such as housing, industrial and automotive. As you talk to your customers and your distributors, perhaps, you could tell us what gives you confidence that the orders that you're seeing do, in fact, reflect real demand, and perhaps, you could talk little bit about the inventory levels to the extent you have visibility into your customers.","Steve Sanghi","Well, our expedite activity is very high. We're just expediting products on multiple fronts, in multiple markets for customers in multiple geographies and multiple sectors. The -- there is really very little inventory at the end customer. While distributor inventory is lower compared to any historic norms. It was up 2 days last quarter, but still on the very low end of, really, the historical norms. So that's really what gives us confidence that the orders are real. We're not getting any net pushout activity or anything like that. There are always moving parts and somebody scheduled a few parts out, somebody else pulls it in. But the net-net debt demand continues to be very strong. The backlog is very healthy. And we are actually struggling to meet all of the demand we have in the current quarter.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up to that, obviously, you mentioned you're increasing production now in response to the order rates that you have in the inventory levels. Could you remind us the impact that the increased production would have on your gross margins? What sort of improvement can we expect going over the next couple of quarters? And as you talk about the 60% long-term gross margin target, is that tied to a particular revenue number? And if so, would you care to share that with us?","Steve Sanghi","So it is tied to a particular number, but we cannot share that. There is internal modeling on it. But if you look at it at the bottom of this cycle -- do you recall what our gross margin was? I think it was 55-point-something, yes?","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, I think that's right.","Steve Sanghi","Something in that area. So the gross margin has continued to come up every quarter. Going into this quarter, at the last conference call, our guidance for the gross margin for the current quarter was 57%. And we delivered 58.04% or something. Actually, I just got the number. The gross margin at the bottom of this cycle was 56%. So I could see that we have come up substantially. And it's come with higher utilization, recalling all the employees back for -- back to a fab-sorting production, and we're currently increasing wafer starts further. So the impact of the gross margin is very positive. We're guiding another increase in gross margin this quarter from 58% last quarter to a mid-point of about 58.4%. And depending on how the quarter goes, I guess further strengthen it, there can be upside to that. And gross margin will continue to increase. Our long-term target is 60%, and there's another 200 basis points to go.","Operator","And we will now go to Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could address some of the longer-dated backlog you referred to in your opening commentary, say, some of it was out past the end of September quarter. Can you maybe give us some context how much of the bookings are scheduled past the end of the quarter or this quarter versus last quarter to the quarter before?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the bookings have been strong now for a couple of quarters. I think this is a repeat comment that we made last quarter also. So from that standpoint, there is not really a substantial change in that. I think what's more important is how much of the backlog customers are requesting in a current quarter, but we're giving them few days out. We're getting significant visibility. So there's a fair amount of backlog into next quarter already. But that is a request in the next quarter, we're delivering in the next quarter. That business is normal. The problem is where certain portion of the backlog, customers will take it in September, and we are just scheduled out a week or 2 weeks out. We're struggling hard to pull it in, and we'll be successful in some and not in some other.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful color. And then as a follow-on, could you maybe talk about how much your internal factory utilization has increased over the past several quarters from, say, trough to the current levels? In other words, maybe if you can express it in points, that'll be helpful.","Steve Sanghi","We don't like to give that numerically. But with the rotating time-off, we have taken the production down significantly. And a lot of that has come back, and we have increased production even beyond that to really meet the current demand and we'll continue to increase it. But neither I have the numerical numbers in front of me nor do we like to share that.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, and it's a mix between our wafer fab and our assembly and test. And assembly and test is cranking out a lot of product today and this is what we utilize.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, so there are 2 other factors. One is assembly and test, which we have been ramping it all last quarter in the fall because a lot of the inventory we had built during slow time was being held up at the high level. So if the demand came back, we can immediately crank up the back end to start to produce more output. The fab cycle time takes longer to improve the output. So that's one factor. The second factor is, as we mentioned in the last conference call, 40% of our dye production now comes from outside foundries, where we do not produce them internally. And there, we are dealing with foundry lead times and queue times and others. And I don't really have -- under our full control were we can expedite around fab.","Operator","And we will now go to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to follow up on the gross margin line. Steve, given that you guys started to re-ramp, it sounds more aggressively, at beginning June. I would have thought that you would have gotten a better utilization at maybe in the September quarter, not that the absolute number is a bad number at all. I'm just kind of curious. When you look at the revenue mix in the September quarter, is more of it coming from the 40% that's now outsourced and that's why you're not getting the leverage, or can you help me understand the incremental gross margins in September versus June which were very strong?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we started improving output in -- probably, in the middle of the quarter and we recalled the people a little bit later as the line got filled up. So we got more than probably just a month. Secondly, we got a very large increase. The attrition out of the back end, which we were expediting the entire quarter because the dye was healthy. So this quarter, we don't really get as much incremental out of the back end. Because the back end, we had to fill last time. And you add a little bit more of the fab. So when you average it, I mean that's sort of the result we get.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Steve, on the top line. When you look at the strength, both in June and September, if you -- how much of that do you attribute to just the inventory level being a lot leaner than a lot of us recognize versus, perhaps, Microchip gaining share versus, I guess even the third bucket is maybe some revenue synergies that you're starting to get with the SMSC acquisition?","Steve Sanghi","Well, there are several questions in there, a bunch of moving parts. But I don't really think customers, end customers, usually hold a lot of inventory these days. The inventory really gets all pushed down to ODMs and distributors and eventually, the semiconductor manufacturer. But the end customer inventory was just totally dry up in a slow time because, probably, the lead times are very short. So as of the demand strengthened, the first step we see is the significant increase in the expedite activity and we rush to provide a product to them. And then it's not whole, and it catches on and the customer set can give you longer-term orders because they see lead times going long. So we don't you see as much change in the end customer inventory that they're holding. It's mostly the pipeline that we have. We're getting much better visibility today than we got it in January.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, relative to perhaps Microchip gaining share and\/or revenue synergies with the recent acquisition?","Steve Sanghi","So share gains are obvious. You could just kind of do the math. We grew, I think, 3.4% in the March quarter. Add the current quarter growth to that, you're dealing with over 10% growth in just the first 2 quarters and add the one we're guiding to for the September. So from December quarter to September quarter, you will see growth somewhere in the 14%-plus range, cumulatively more than that. So that's a significant growth. Obviously, the markets and economy are not growing that strong. So somehow, a lot of that is growth. A lot of that is new products. A lot of them are exposure to stronger segments and a combination of all those. And there is some part of that, which is the third comment you made, getting some revenue accretion from SMSC. Yes, we've gotten some of that, but that's longer-term. Much of that is still on the design win stage, and we will continue to comment in the year, this year, next year and the year after. But some of it is there.","Operator","And we will now go to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Steve, I have a couple of questions. Microchip always does very well when coming off of periods in bad markets. You guys always end up taking a bunch of share. This happened in '09. It's happening again. I'm curious what drives that? It's got to be just more than just having a strong balance sheet relative to your competitors. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on that.","Ganesh Moorthy","During the down cycles, we continued to stay invested in our product roadmaps. We continued to stay invested in our customers and the support that they need to design in with our products and we continued to work on our internal operational efficiencies. And that's what the shared sacrifice approach takes, is we -- keeps our people intact, keeps our systems intact, we get the expense reductions we need, positions us for strength as we come out of these. That's exactly what happened in the '09, '10 time frame and exactly what we're doing here between 2012 and 2013. And in all of that, we're able to outperform people with the investments we've made, as well as with the operational improvements we've made.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then second question, as a follow-up. Steve, I think you touched upon this a little bit earlier. Gross margin of, call it, 58% and change, a long-term goal of 60%. What's the biggest factor in getting there?","Steve Sanghi","The biggest factor in getting there is really getting the production higher. We are not at the peak production from a factory as yet. When we had higher gross margins at -- the peak production from our factory goes higher, more of the product is now running in the outside foundries for various different reasons. We're ramping production inside, but we're not at the peak production yet. So I think that's the biggest factor. And then there are a lot of the second and third effects, a whole bunch of SMSC, probe, assembly and test is driving the Microchip factories, which will continue to have accretive effect in the coming year. There is cost reduction, some conversion to new technologies. But those are a bunch of moving parts that happen in our business all the time. And I think the 2 different changes that are not always normal is number one, getting back to a higher production, and number two, completing some of the longer-term accretion items in the SMSC acquisition. SMSC integration is complete. It's running as one company that's fully intertwined. But some of the longer-term items are transferring some of their assembly and test, pro production to inside longer-term items, which are continuing.","Operator","And we will now go to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you just give us a little more color on the lead time situations? I guess, what percentage of product is seeing the increased lead times? What are normal, where have they gone to now and when -- or what it depends on, do you think they'll get their lead times back to normal value?","James Eric Bjornholt","There's no such thing as a fixed lead time. It's a pretty broad range. There are products in which the lead times are small as 3, 4 weeks or available off-the-shelf in some cases, and others where lead times are going to be north of 12 to 16 weeks, in that range. It's a function of what source they come from, what the inventory position on them is, what the demand picture looks like. We have so many line items that are spread across, that there's not a single lead time thing. We're continuously working on the improvement of the supply to meet our customers' requirements and bring the lead times in. And that's an ongoing challenge. Obviously, for some of it that's inside Microchip, it's an easier approach. We have more control on being able to affect change. For some of the things that are outside, we work with the foundries and do the normal things that people who use outside our fabs do to try and get our fair share.","Steve Sanghi","I could give you 2 extremes. The shortest lead time is a product we can build in our fabs and we can fully assemble and test it in our factory and ship it. And on a product where there are thousands of customers, hundreds and thousands of customers, a very broad, high-volume product with just lots and lots of customers buying it. Because on that product, we can build it inside plus we can build inventory because it has a broad usage. That will have the shortest lead time and most likely on the shelf. You go to the other extreme, and you take a product that runs at a foundry, gets probe, assembled and tested outside, hasn't been brought it yet either as SMSC product or could be one of our product that runs outside. And if you add on the top of that, especially a product that has a very narrow customer base, 1 or 2 customers buy it, and it doesn't really have a broad-based usage in consumer, industrial communication, PC, a lot of Microchip products, then we cannot build a lot of inventory because the inventory can go obsolete. And some of that product is largely distant -- built on specific customer demand, either on order or understanding with the customers. So that will have the longest lead time. Those 2 are the extremes. And you have -- and that extreme could be 18 weeks. The lowest that is built inside is off-the-shelf. And then, there are products all over the place. That are maybe fab-ed inside, tested outside or fab outside, tested inside, small customer base, large customer base, all over the place. We sell over 100,000 SKUs.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then another, I guess, my follow-up question, is just on cash and cash management. So as you guys have talked about and as you're demonstrating, is that some of the best margins and some of the highest dividend yields in your space. Is it -- probably, you have your cash and growth continues to outpace dividend growth? And you also have a little bit of share count creep over the last several quarters. So I'm just wondering, do you think about having some sort of regular token buyback? Or do you think about maybe increasing the dividend a little more? And then if you could also address why you increased the revolver to, I mean to $2 billion up from $750 million?","James Eric Bjornholt","Okay. So from a cash basis, obviously, we've been very committed to the dividend program, and that's where our priority is over any share buyback. It's pretty clear in our public documents and how we talk to investors that we have a lot more cash offshore than we have onshore. So we want to be selective on how we use that cash and returning it to shareholders through the dividend program. And so stock buyback is not something that we are considering any time in the near future. We would consider it if the market did something crazy with the stock, that will be something and we have to revisit with the board. So that's primarily where we're focused on. The facility that was put in place in late June with the new revolver. It's essentially an expansion of what we had before. We had a $750 million line of credit before. We've expanded that up to $2 billion. We were borrowing roughly $600 million on that revolver at the end of the quarter, $610 million. And that is essentially dry powder for us for any expansion requirements that we see in U.S. through acquisition or any other strategic mean.","Steve Sanghi","Can you get also the question on share creep?","James Eric Bjornholt","Share creep. So yes, the share creep is driven by just ongoing equity programs that we have. But the largest factor there is the convertible debt that we have outstanding and the dilution that comes with that with additional shares outstanding as the stock price increases. And so the stock prices out, obviously, gone up over the last quarter. And what we factored into our guidance here is about $40 average stock price, not knowing where else to peg that for the September quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Sumit Dhanda with ISI.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions, guys. On -- mainly on geographic trends. First one on that, Steve, have you seen anything that suggests that the time of business, especially from a white goods or appliance perspective, are you seeing any slowdown or pertubation[ph], given all the concerns on the economy there? And then, as you look into the September quarter, are there particular geographies you expect to outperform versus the others? Or is it mainly a seasonal pattern as it relates to the individual geographies?","Steve Sanghi","Well, our China business is very strong. And at the first blush would not jive with the substitute reading. We read the reports on both sides. And things are good and things are slowing down in China, but our results don't speak for that. So either it could be a significant market share gain. It could also be the segments we are in, sectors we are serving. And it could also be that the China market is on the lower end of the bit scale. There isn't as much to apply that 32-bit over there. There's a lot of 8 and 16-bit market. And our product lines are very, very healthy. We're gaining a lot of share in 8 and, 16, we got nearly 1,000 products in those segments. And as other competitors may have miscalculated that transition and have maybe consolidated all their resources on 32-bit and very much supported by analysts' viewpoint, I must say, probably didn't serve them well.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then in terms of the outlook into the September quarter, is there something you expect from a geographic perspective that's different from outside the norm of seasonality?","Steve Sanghi","No, this is a -- September quarter is usually a weak quarter in Europe. And the normal quarter in U.S. and Asia, and we won't expect anything different. All the sentiment from Europe is that Europe is on demand. I mean Europe was in recession. The business in the [indiscernible] countries is very, very small, especially for our kind of products. Germany is very, very strong and the sentiment is very good in Germany and the reports that we are getting and the activity we are seeing in Europe. Europe is on the mend. In fact, Europe would have a seasonally stronger summer than they historically have relative to the June quarter.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one more question, Steve. You mentioned that bringing some of the back end operations for SMSC announced will help the gross margins. Is that fully comprehended in your 60% target? Or do think that could be a source of additional upside to the long-term target?","Steve Sanghi","That, I choose not to be granular about. There are lots of moving parts in trying to get there. And I want to leave some room there. So I don't really know. Like we have an internal model, but I don't want to share the total parameters of that model.","Operator","And we will now go to Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, I think you referred to there being some sort of longer-term areas of integration of SMSC that had not yet been realized. With accretion being $0.10 a quarter and the fiscal year target being, I think, $0.40 to $0.45. I want to understand if this longer-term accretion opportunities were factored into that $0.40 to $0.45 accretion for the fiscal year or if you're talking about some opportunities with levels beyond that?","Steve Sanghi","So some of that is factored into going from $0.10 where we are at, to trying to get to the $0.40 to $0.45 for the year. But especially the sales part of the synergies are beyond that. So we're getting a lot of new designs into automotive and audio and the computing segment with Microchip products next to SMSC products and set top boxes and USB and Ethernet and LAN and other places. And a lot of those are 1 year, 1.5-year design cycles. So that's not all going to be in here this year. Some yes, some not. You're seeing stronger growth, and that stronger growth and market share gains are driven by a lot of our core growth, but are also getting some help from having a broader platform where products can sit next to each other. That will continue for several years. The manufacturing piece that brings accretion, we will not be completed with all the manufacturing transfers inside Microchip by the end of this year, either. Some of that will go into fiscal year 2015.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. My follow-up question is regarding projected utilization. Specifically, if under a scenario, that revenue, let's say, were flat in a seasonably softer December quarter, would that warrant you taking utilization up further in the December quarter from your planned September levels?","Steve Sanghi","If December quarter is seasonally flat to September quarter, then we, probably would ramp the fab a little bit on some specific leading-edge technologies where the demand is very strong. And those technologies are more complex so they require more steps, but they will not be a meaningful change if the underlying business was flat.","James Eric Bjornholt","Right. We're projecting inventory to be relatively flat in the current quarter. It's within our model. So I agree with that.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I can ask the question a different way. What's the ramification of now having a higher outsourced model? Are you going to experience lower utilization declines in seasonally weaker periods or is this not going to be necessarily used on a small quarter-to-quarter basis, just in larger cyclical correction?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so having 40% of our business at foundries, what it gives us, I believe, is if 100% of the business came from inside, when the downturn comes, we have to absorb it all inside, cut production and have a deeper impact. When 40% of the business comes from foundries, it's easier to cut production in foundries without having a negative impact on it because of foundries are observing the utilization essentially. So actually, the model gets better slightly. It has some other negative ramifications. You have less than control and longer lead times and all that. But in a slow time, it helps you to correct the inventory much more rapidly.","Operator","And we will now go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. In the 32-bit controller market, there appears to be a wider variety of architectures and approaches, like multi-core processors and more complex schemes. Could you provide your view on the extent to which 32-bit market may be different? Or do you think these type of complex schemes really are not relevant in that space?","Ganesh Moorthy","32-bit market is a large market. There are lots of opportunities for Microchip as we push into a broader range of 32-bit products. I don't want to comment on any specific architectural or other improvements we are heading towards. But clearly, we're aware and paying attention to the customers and markets that we either serve or plan to serve, and have a roadmap consistent with being able to push the different parameters, performance, features, costs and otherwise, in the 32-bit market.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up on a different tactic, can you please provide us with an update on your onshore, offshore cash position?","James Eric Bjornholt","Sure. So our onshore cash is somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. We obviously have our credit facility that we can tap into and it -- the less of the credit facility that we're using in the U.S., the lower our costs are. So we manage that as well as we can. But the vast majority of our cash is offshore. That's driven by the acquisitions that we've done that have been U.S.-sourced, taking up U.S. cash, and 80% of our business being offshore. So we've got a lot of the profits that earned offshore.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","I was wondering, as you've mentioned, you've already got 40% of your business in foundries. And as you evolve towards more complex products, such as the 32-bit as that becomes a greater percentage of your run rate, have you given any thought to your process technology roadmap there? Are you considering increasing your capabilities so you might be able to maintain your foundry reliance at 40%? Or do you see this going up over time?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the reliance on the foundries has largely been driven by acquisition. The internal shift has been a smaller and slower portion of it because while in some advanced technologies and 32-bit and others, we have gone out, but we've also advanced the state of the technology inside, where some of the products that we're built outside several years ago are now built inside. So we have more ability to keep picking from it and keep that mix more reasonably stable. What has driven this number is really adding $400 million type of business at SMSC, which is all driven outside. And prior to that, the SST acquisition, where 100% of business was outside, plus some of the small transactions we have done, roaming networks in the networking area and other number of small transaction we have done in the last few years. That has been the primary reason why they're outside. When you don't have your own fab, you have the tendency to just go down and move slow and find the smallest technology you can find. And sometimes, it's not the best technology, but that's what fabless companies tend to do.","Operator","And it appears, there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending this conference call. Microchip management and myself and Eric Bjornholt will be at Citibank conference in early September.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, also be at the Jefferies conference in August.","Steve Sanghi","Jefferies conference in August. So we'll see some of you at those conferences. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our acquisition integration activities, and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","","Net sales in the September quarter were a record $546.2 million, including $16.9 million of net sales from ISSC, and were up 2.8% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter.","Revenue by product line was a record $361.8 million for microcontrollers, $122.6 million for analog, $32.5 million for memory, $22.6 million for licensing and $6.8 million of other. Revenue from ISSC is classified within microcontrollers.","","Revenue by geography was a record $108.6 million in the Americas, $110.8 million in Europe, and $326.8 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place.","","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.1% in the September quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.5% of sales. Net income was $150.2 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.67 per diluted share.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 56.3% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.6 million of share-based compensation, and $12.7 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC.","","Total operating expenses were $206.1 million, or 37.7% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $45.4 million, share-based compensation of $12.6 million, $1.8 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $0.8 million.","The GAAP net income was $93.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes non-recurring favorable tax events of $10.5 million, which were primarily associated with the release of certain valuation allowances, the passing of the statute of limitations on certain tax reserves, and the favorable closing of a tax audit.","","In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 1.5%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $10.5 million of non-recurring tax events that I mentioned before.","Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various non-recurring items. Excluding any non-recurring events, we expect our longer-term, forward-looking, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%.","","To summarize the after-tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.241, share-based compensation was about $0.06, non-recurring favorable tax events were about $0.047. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP non-controlling interest in ISSC was a favorable $0.009, and the non-cash interest expense was about $0.007.","","The dividend declared today of $0.3565 per share will be paid on December 5, 2014, to shareholders of record on November 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.7 million.","This quarter's dividend will be our 49th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 43rd occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And the accumulative dividends paid amount to almost $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","","During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back when we issued our convertible in fiscal year 2008. Our total return to shareholders through dividend and stock buy-back over the past 49 quarters is approximately $3.8 billion.","","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at September 30, 2014, was $275.7 million, or 105 days, compared to 109 days at the end of the June quarter. The inventory balance at September 30, 2014, includes $4.5 million of inventory write-up costs associated with our acquisitions as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Including the inventory write up, excluding the inventory write-up, Microchip had 109 days of inventory on its balance sheet as of the end of the quarter.","","We have taken steps to adjust our capacity in our wafer fabs and our assembly and test facilities given the current business environment. Inventory at our distributors increased by three days in the September quarter and are at 34 days.","Most of the distribution inventory build in the quarter was at our distributors in Asia. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","","The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition of ISSC and our dividend payment, was $156.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.124 billion. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit decreased to $965.6 million.","","Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $140 million in the December quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $38.7 million for the September quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $150 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","","Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $24.3 million. Historically, the ISSC business has recognized revenue in the distribution channel on a sell-in basis. Microchip will be changing the contractual relationships with ISSC's distributors effective November 1, to move to a sell-through revenue-recognition model.","","During this transition, Microchip's reported GAAP revenue will not include the sell-through of any inventory that was in the ISSC distribution channel as of the end of October.","Based on about 1.5 months of inventory in the ISSC distribution channel, we expect GAAP revenue will be about $7 million lower in the December quarter than it would have been if ISSC had historically recognized revenue on a sell-through basis.","","To provide investors with an appropriate understanding of the true end-market demand for the ISSC products, Microchip will report its non-GAAP revenue in the December quarter for ISSC, based on if a full sell-through model had been in place for ISSC in the past. We expect non-GAAP revenue for ISSC to be about $17 million in the December quarter.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter, and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?","","Ganesh Moorthy","","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Including ISSC revenue, which will be reported as part of our microcontroller revenue, our overall microcontroller business grew 5.2% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter, thus achieving a new record.","","Excluding revenue from ISSC, our overall microcontroller revenue grew by 0.3% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 7.4% versus the year ago quarter, and also achieved a new revenue record.","We're being transparent with the revenue added from our ISSC acquisitions, so that analysts and investors can more meaningfully compare our microcontroller results to other companies.","","Excluding any revenue from ISSC, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 8.3% sequentially in the September quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 23.3% versus the year-ago quarter.","This business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us, as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio.","Excluding revenue from ISSC, our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 7.6% sequentially in the September quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 38.6% versus the year-ago quarter.","","We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs, and expand our presence in new fields of play, to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business, combined with our 16-bit microcontroller business, together are at the size and growth rate where they're making meaningful contribution to our ongoing growth.","","We believe we are continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share and expect the 2014 market share rankings to bear that out when it is published next year. We have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share, as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Microcontroller\u2019s revenue represented 66.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.","","Now moving to analog products. Our analog business was down 4.1% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. This business continues to have strong design win momentum, and represented 22.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","","Now moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory, as well as our SuperFlash memory products. This business was down 2.6% sequentially. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.","","Finally, the ISSC integration is moving ahead at full speed, and will transition to our business systems on November 1. We expect to complete buying the majority of the approximately 16% of shares of ISSC that we don't yet own, and de-listing ISSC from the Taiwan stock exchange by the end of December 2014. Steve will provide much more color on the ISSC and Supertex acquisitions in his prepared remarks.","So let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","","Steve Sanghi","","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Then I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions, and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. I will also comment on the macro-cycle call we made three weeks ago.","","We are disappointed with the level of business activity in the September quarter. September quarter is usually a very back-end-weighted quarter, because of traditional weak August, due to holidays in various parts of the world.","The month of September is usually a very strong month for our revenue after the summer holiday period. This time, the September sales did not materialize to our expectations, leading us to pre-announce the quarter on October 9, 2014.","","There were a few bright spots in the results, in the areas of microcontrollers and licensing division. As Ganesh mentioned, 16-bit MCUs were up 8.1% sequentially, and 32-bit MCUs were up 7.6% sequentially.","Overall MCU revenue achieved another all-time record in the quarter. Licensing division revenue was up 10.5% sequentially, reflecting increased penetration of our SuperFlash technology at foundries and IDMs, alike.","","During the quarter we worked on simultaneous integration of two different acquisitions. On April 1, 2014, we had closed the acquisition of Supertex. By July 1, 2014, we had integrated the financial and business systems of Supertex with Microchip's. During the quarter we successfully qualified many of the high-volume products of Supertex in Microchip's Tempe, Arizona, fab.","","During the quarter, we also decided that we will close down Supertex San Jose Fab. It is a six-inch wafer fab located in a leased building in San Jose, California. Currently we are on schedule to make the last wafer start in San Jose fab by the end of November. We will close the fab sometime in February 2015.","We have allotted for making some last-time buy wafers for the products that have not been qualified in the Tempe fab yet, and also to provide overlap for customers qualifying their products from Tempe fab.","","During the quarter, we also decided to phase out production in Supertex the Hong Kong test facility. The cost of production there is significantly more expensive than Microchip's high-volume facility in Thailand. Production in the Hong Kong facility will be phased out by February 2015, also.","We believe that closure of the Santa Jose fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last-time buy inventory has been shipped out.","Supertex's business model is already improving significantly. Last quarter, Supertex's gross margin was 54.7%, and operating margin was approximately 24.7%. When the full impact of production in Microchip's facilities is baked in, we believe Supertex will be operating at Microchip's gross and operating profit models.","I remind you that Supertex standalone non-GAAP operating margin, in the full calendar year 2013 before the acquisition was 17.2%. Supertex contributed $0.014 accretion last quarter, which will go to about $0.03 per quarter after the full effect of factory shut-downs has been baked in. We believe it will take about a year to see the full impact.","Now about ISSC acquisition. ISSC added $16.9 million to our net sales in the September quarter, and contributed about $0.01 accretion to our non-GAAP EPS. The integration of ISSC is under way. We are on target to consolidate the financial and business systems of ISSC with Microchip's on November 1, 2014. The organization of ISSC is also being merged with the divisional, sales, finance, and other organizations of Microchip.","","The September quarter was also our 96th consecutive profitable quarter. We have four more quarters to go in order to hit the century mark for consecutive profitable quarters. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 96 consecutive profitable quarters.","","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. December quarter is seasonally the weakest quarter for Microchip. Having seen most of the correction in the September quarter, we expect the December quarter revenue to be only slightly below typical seasonal levels.","We expect our non-GAAP revenue to be down 2% to 7% sequentially in the December quarter. In adjusting our factories, we have selectively pushed out some capital equipment previously on order, but we are continuing to invest in our growth initiatives.","","Continuing on the guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58% and 58.2% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales and we expect operating profit to be between 30.5% and 31.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.59 and $0.64 per share.","","Now let's talk about the semiconductor cycle and our pre-announcement. In each semiconductor business cycle, this debate rages in the investment and analyst community. Does Microchip have an internal Microchip problem or do our results reflect a weakening macro?","And each time we give the same explanation regarding how we see the effect of industry events earlier than others, and we have subsequently been vindicated when the entire industry softens a quarter or so later. But after all these times of telling us that we were right in the previous cycles, the controversy after we make the comments the same as we have seen in the prior cycles. This time it is no different, and it seems that it is really par for the course.","I have seen an unprecedented amount of spin in explaining the weak guidance of other companies. One company even called it amplified seasonality, with customers wanting to make sure that they position inventory where they're going to be comfortable at. Now what is that, that sounds like a correction.","According to Needham's report, 73% of the companies that have reported thus far have issued guidance lower than consensus, and that does not include companies that reported yesterday or today. This process at other companies in the past have taken two earning cycles to complete, so you have to wait for the January earnings season to see the whole story unfold, and see what happens at all the selling companies.","The overarching question remains whether there is a slow-down of the industry ahead, led by China, or was it a company-specific Microchip problem.","So let me digress for a minute. At Microchip, we are the students of Jim Collins' famous book, Good To Great. I adopted some of those principles in Microchip culture, which was also documented in my book, titled Driving Excellence. Jim Collins defined level-live leadership in his book.","When things go well, a level-five leader looks out the window and thanks his people for having done a great job. I have always thanked my people for having done a great job in achieving 96 consecutive quarters of profitability. Jim Collins says that when things go wrong, a level-five leader looks in the mirror, and takes responsibility, and internalizes what he personally could have done better.","Now, December quarter guidance from the industry has been a mixed bag so far. If it turns out that Microchip was wrong in making a cycle call, I would look in the mirror and personally take responsibility to correct whatever may be wrong in our business.","However, you are already starting to see commentary from late reporting companies about bookings weakness; weakness in industrial and consumer markets; inventory management by distributors; weakness in Asia; and some even -- some companies even calling for broad weakness across most end markets; and weak macro conditions, combined with seasonality to cause near-double-digit revenue declines. That is, and I quote, amplified \u201cseasonality\u201d.","In terms of taking responsibility, we are going through all of our business units, geographical data, direct customers, and distributors with a fine tooth comb. In case our call turns out to be wrong, we want to be prepared in understanding what went wrong and already taken steps taken to correct it.","There was a belief on the street that Microchip's problem was caused by the customer letter that we issued on July 31. When you have a few large customers, it is easy to communicate with them regarding your lead times and business environment. With more than 80,000 customers at Microchip, it is very difficult to get the message across without writing such letters and posting them on the web.","We were receiving complaints from customers that they needed to be informed that lead time on some products had stretched out. So Microchip wrote the letter to inform our broad base of customers.","In fact, the letter had no effect on our revenue, and it stands to reason that a letter issued on July 31 communicating 12 weeks of lead time would have no impact on the September quarter revenue. If the letter is accused of causing any double ordering, then the September quarter sales should have gone up, not down.","In reality, the September distribution sales did not materialize, and distribution inventory increased. If we had selling revenue recognition like some of our peers use, we too would have met our guidance for the September quarter. So the letter was not it.","Continuing to diagnose the business within Microchip, our microcontroller business without counting ISSC was up about 0.3% sequentially to another record. It was also up 7.4% from same quarter last year. We did not add the revenue of ISSC acquisition completed last quarter, to make a fair comparison to other companies. The last quarter over a year ago quarter performance is better than many of our microcontroller competitors.","So we are comfortable with how the businesses are performing inside. Now in every cycle, when we miss a quarter the old bear thesis comes out of the woodwork, like Microchip doesn't have ARM-based MCUs, they are mainly exposed to 8-bit, their 16-bit and 32-bit businesses are small, et cetera.","Now we don't break out the numbers by bit density due to competitive reasons, but today we can give you a hint that our combined 16 and 32-bit microcontroller business is about $400 million to $500 million annually, not small by any stretch of the imagination.","So this bear thesis has been proven wrong every time, and Microchip has continued to gain significant share in microcontrollers and analog. Looking at all of the late earnings reports that have come out, I can already see this bear thesis getting proven wrong again.","The current point in the cycle, or whatever you wish to call it, has made a very good entry point in Microchip's stock, with substantial return as the recovery unfolds. We expect to complete this recovery with a sequential increase in revenue in the March quarter.","I also want to point out that many of Microchip's analysts who have gone through this experience before, and have invested time to understand our business dynamic were very constructive after our warning, and recognized that we have called this correctly several times before. Our thanks are due for their taking time over the years to understand the dynamics of our business, and for their support.","In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position, and our future prospects with the investment we have made and are continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip.","With that, operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We'll take now take Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Steve, I wondered if you could maybe take us through the last month since the pre-announcement. Obviously at the time and it sounds like you still feel that way, that we're in an industry down-turn. But based on your guidance, it would seem to be a fairly mild down turn as compared to some of the others.","I guess a few questions on that. Is that an accurate assessment of how you feel? Has anything changed in your view since you made the call earlier in the month and what gives you confidence in the visibility that you have?","Steve Sanghi","","Well, nothing has changed since we made that call. In fact, many other companies are singing the same song. We did not quantify in our pre-release. We didn't have all the data to be able to provide the guidance at that time, so it was a very limited release.","We could have waited another 21 days to tell the numbers today. But \u2013 son in pre-release we simply made the statement that we see a correction coming. The street reaction and their interpretation of that correction was grossly overestimated.","","And, we see a yes, we see a slight correction and one to two quarters worth. For us, last quarter was down, this quarter is nearly seasonal. Our last 10 year average of seasonality for December quarter is minus 4.38, to be exact.","To do that math, you've got to take some of the acquisitions out. If you're doing an acquisition in August and you know, it skews the numbers, so you have to do some math to do that. Minus 4.38, and our guidance is pretty much seasonal for this quarter, and we expect us to sequentially grow in the March quarter.","","Operator","","We'll now take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy","Yes, thanks for taking my question. So I was wondering, Steve, if you could or Eric, if you could address the question that's come up as to whether the shift in the dollar to yen exchange rate, which has now persisted for a few quarters might have been altering your competitive position against Renesas and may have driven some consumers away?","Steve Sanghi","Well, Joanne, nobody asked us the question when yen went the other way whether our competitive position was improving. The fact of the matter is microcontroller designs are done two years before, and microcontroller sockets are not competed on such a close price issue of yen versus a dollar.","A large majority of Renesas business is in Japan, where we have a relatively small business. We see really relatively small competition with them in US and Europe. The ones we see are mainly in the automotive market, where designs are three, four-year designs. It really absolutely has zero impact.","Eric Bjornholt","JoAnne, to add to that, you can see the Renesas results. They are public, and there is nothing to write home about.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, that's helpful. As then a follow-up, I'm wondering, you know, you're always faced with a difficult question about what your end markets look like, and the geographical distribution not being terribly representative of the actual end consumers. But given that you've come to have to look at this cycle, I'm wondering if you've looked at perhaps another way to represent your end markets?","And in particular, to what sorts of end markets in China are you most exposed, given all the acquisitions you've had, in which sorts of products?","And if you can address that, and perhaps how much you're exposed to the housing market perhaps then you can let us know what you think about the new China stimulus measures that were announced just yesterday, and how that might affect the extent of your recovery here?","Steve Sanghi","","Well, obviously, any stimulus measures announced in China will have a positive effect on us, like it would in any other market. JoAnne, our business is the broadest business any company could have. I don't know really how everybody else counts the number of their customers, but our top 10 customers don't make even 10% of our business.","You'll have to go deep tail, we've got 80,000 customers. We do business with everybody, you know, people making no matter what, because microcontroller and analog, they are the most ubiquitous devices. You've got chips in light pens and cables and just everything.","","So we have a very, very broad business and with such a broad business, you're very much tied into the sentiment of every little company building stuff and lots and lots of small companies who build their stuff in their own garage shop and don't use the large subcontractors and don't have the sophisticated supply chains and multiple subcontractors building products for them. In that kind of environment information is very hard to get and can easily take a quarter.","Because every subcontractor thinks well they gained market share. They're doing 60% of the total. If there are three subcontractors, everybody thinks they're doing 40% of the total, and that number adds up to 120%, just like there's inventory in the channel.","","But with our customers with a long tail, it's the chief engineer who is the President and he's directing the buy. We see the impact of any market moves economy related directly on our revenue on a sell-through basis from distribution and also from our direct customers. And with that kind of business, it's very, very difficult to give you end market breakdown, because we do business with everybody.","","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy","","Okay. We'll do our best with that. Thanks.","","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","","We'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust","Great. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Not exactly to follow up on that prior one, but Steve you did highlight that the weakness came from the channel in China. Meanwhile we actually saw pretty robust results from the likes of both Arrow and Avnet, which I think are, represent at least part of your channel. They had good results.","So should we think about this maybe as kind of smaller tier two type suppliers or rather distributors? And maybe you can also talk about if there's any identification of the weakness from not only an end market perspective, but large versus smaller customers, OEMs versus contract manufacturers, regionally in China, it's just a bit perplexing? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","","Well, Several ways to answer that. Number one there are lots of moving parts. When you look at Arrows and Avnet, a very large majority of their business is US and Europe. China is the smallest portion of their business relative to the other two geographies. Our US and Europe business was very good. Did you give the growth rates in your commentary?","","Eric Bjornholt","","Yes, Americas was up about 5% and Europe was up 1%.","","Steve Sanghi","","Yes. So we were up in both geographies, so US and Europe were very good. So our problem was in China. Our business in Asia is a much larger percentage than Arrow's and Avnet's business is, so that will really explain one.","","Secondly, every single question you can ask in this line what we saw versus the others saw, we make this statement and we make this explanation in every cycle, because the way our business is, which I just explained in answering Joanne's question, we have a very long tail of lots of these small customers, and revenue recognition based on sell-through, that we do see effects of industry turns early, about a quarter or so early.","It's happened every time. We go through the same criticism and the same line of questions every time. I don't even know why we do it. And a quarter letter when things settle, then everybody has seen it and then for now then people are telling me for the last 10 years, we have called every one of them right. This is going to be the same.","William Stein - SunTrust","","Steve, I appreciate that. If I can ask one follow-up, perhaps you could talk a little bit about capacity planning. I know that last quarter at this time you were talking about some spot shortages, as I recall and having to add capacity kind of as quickly as you could in order to meet customer demand.","And I'm wondering if perhaps there is a different approach where you may get, you may want to add the capacity in advance of the rush sort of demand and kind of talk maybe a bit about your capacity planning generally? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","","Well, you know, we've been in business 24 years. I have been on this job and we've gone through many cycles and our capacity planning has been excellent. This was a one time. We are on a select group of new products and technologies.","Our business, as I mentioned, last quarter was growing nearly 15% to 20% sequentially per quarter, quarter-after-quarter for many quarters, almost a couple of years. And we went into a plan for the fiscal year to put a capacity for 50% growth on those products, which internally was questioned are we crazy, and so on and so forth and if I told you, you would really ask similar questions.","","We grew more than that. We grew 70% to 75%. So it was because of tremendous success in a certain line of products. It wasn't across the board. It was certain select group of products. The weakness we saw in the September quarter has largely corrected that problem minor amount that remains really gets corrected this quarter.","So it was a really short term kind of problem. We have fixed it. It's not a deep rooted capacity-planning issue. We're really good at it.","","William Stein - SunTrust","","That's helpful, Thank you.","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","","Great. Thank you. Can you follow up on the comments that you do see it as kind of a slight correction calendar Q3 and Q4? What's the feedback like from customers in the channel as you look into March quarter, which typically is up and you're calling that to be up at this early stage?","Steve Sanghi ","Do you want to take that?","Eric Bjornholt","","Yes, we don't have all the visibility into March that perhaps your question implies. We look at what does it seasonally look like. We look at how is the backlog for the March quarter starting to build. We know what has flushed through the system in September and in our guidance for December.","And if you put all that together, the best of our intelligence and our own analysis, what we're hearing from our customers, what we're hearing from our field, gives us the confidence to talk about the March quarter being up.","Steve Sanghi","","Yes, if I could add, now if the slope for September was still heading down farther away from seasonality, one would ask the question does it get arrested at some point. That's not the case. It's already arrested, so it's not really getting any more worse.","I think guidance for September is already kind of seasonal, so it's highly unlikely. There's really almost no reason for it that the March quarter then gets away from seasonality again in a negative direction. It's just not likely there will be a double dip.","","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","","Got it. And then as my follow-up Steve, you made the comment you view the stock after the pull-back here as attractive. The company in the past has been opportunistic in terms of buy-back. So how do you view that in terms of buying back your own stock, versus pursuing potential M&A opportunities?","","Steve Sanghi","","We don't really have any US cash to buy back stock. We cannot buy stock with our foreign money without writing a check to Washington, and we're not going to do that. So we'll maintain the foreign cash for acquisitions or to bring it in when some tax favored deal can be put together like it was several years ago for patriation.","So meanwhile, we continue to be active, looking for various M&A opportunities rather than buying back stock.","","Eric Bjornholt","","And we have the debt capacity to be able to go out and do those things.","","Steve Sanghi","","We do have a $1 billion plus remaining on our line of credit, but we're not going to use it for buying stock. It's not that far away from where it was, you know, $3 or $4, you know, that's not it.","","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","","Operator","","We will now take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","","Harsh Kumar - Stephens","","Hi, Steve. If I can ask you, what in your best opinion was the source of the weakness that you are seeing? Is it you think in your best opinion inventory driven, or was it just a spot pause in demand? And we're hearing from you things have already picked up. Just if you can give us some color we would appreciate it.","","Steve Sanghi","","Well, you know, I am sure and I hope you guys watch the news that I watch and the headlines that I watch. China industrial production was the lowest in 5 years. The growth of that China housing market has been well written. The negative effect on China GDP that has been seen from stimulus that was taken away for a while ago.","And then you know the macro conditions were slow. And we had anticipated a certain amount of demand. And sometimes people have trouble making a connection between inventory and lower demand. It's really one and the same.","","When the demand is low it creates inventory, because you were building it to a higher demand and then you have to correct for it and it's really one and the same. But macro conditions in China were weak. The whole LP build has been lower. You have seen that in the results of companies who were exposed to that. You have seen broad based guys like announced in the last week. You've seen from plenty of them.","Other than really one smartphone manufacturer, unless you're really largely exposed to it, that has been the only strength driven by shipping RF and all those things into those phones. The other big cell phone guy has been weak, also. So there's really only been one place to hide, which is if you're exposed highly to the guy in Cupertino.","","Harsh Kumar - Stephens","","That's, fair, Steve. Steve, as we look out, Steve and Eric, as we look out to December and we try to model for that $20 million odd sort of decline that your guidance suggests, should we think of spreading that roughly equally amongst the different businesses by percentage rating, of course?","","Steve Sanghi","","Yes. We've got 13, 14 different divisions inside of Microchip that we put together in about three or four buckets report to you. We can't really break it out on a guidance. We got the numbers, but we believe that it will be reasonably spread equally.","","Harsh Kumar - Stephens","","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it, as always.","","Steve Sanghi","","Thank you.","Operator","","And I'll move on to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, guys. Steve, thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I was wondering if you could help quantify a little bit how much you're taking down utilization, how much were you able to get ahead of this within the September quarter versus December. Is there sort of an inventory target we should think about for the company exiting December?","And as my follow-up, is the gross-margin decline in December all utilization driven and will there be a residual effect in the March quarter for some of the actions you're taking in December on utilization?","Steve Sanghi","","So, you want to answer that?","","Eric Bjornholt","","Sure. I can answer the utilization piece. So, yes, we've taken our factories down. There's some impact in the December quarter from that. We would not project at this point that gross margins would go lower in the March quarter.","So with the decline in revenue and we are building inventory in the December quarter, we would expect that just based on our accounting practices we would have higher inventory obsolescence charges, probably not true obsolescence, but obsolescence\u2019s charges from an accounting standpoint.","","With our expectation that revenue will increase in the March quarter, we would not expect that to repeat. So, we have taken our utilization down in both fabs and assembly and test facilities, but we aren't breaking out a specific percentage for the street.","","Steve Sanghi","","So, in our accounting practice, when we have under-utilization we charge it immediately to the current quarter, if the utilization go below a threshold. Some other companies put it all into the inventory, and the gross margin goes lower when they ship that high cost product.","We are very transparent, so we take it right away in the current quarter, so that's what you see. So if the utilization doesn't go any lower next quarter, which there's no reason it should, you shouldn't see any further lower gross margin.","","Eric Bjornholt","","Adding to your point on inventory, so if you take out all the goofy acquisition accounting, and we ended the September quarter with about 109 days of inventory. And we've got a fairly broad range for the current quarter that's in our release for what inventory could do, just based on our revenue range.","But based on the mid-point of our guidance, we think that increase in inventory might be seven or eight days. That would take it to let's say 116 at the mid point. That's kind of on target with what our external guidance has been for target for the longer term.","","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","","Eric, just as clarification, that's inventory on your balance sheet? What do you expect through distribution in the December quarter?","","Eric Bjornholt","","That's a hard one to forecast. We were at pretty low levels heading into the September quarter. It went up by 3 days. If you look at where it's been in the last 5 or 6 years, it's ranged between 27 and 47 days. So sitting at 34 days doesn't really concern us. But you know, there will be some movement, but it's very hard to forecast.","","Steve Sanghi","","So, you know, that's another area where I think street's interpretation of our inventory build was a massive inventory in the channel, hundreds of millions of dollars or something. Inventory went up from 31 to 34 days, I mean, that's all. And you know, many companies that say they've got distribution inventory ranges, 8 to 10 weeks or something like that, it's a slight shift, but it all happened to be in China.","That three days increase, it all happened in China. So the number of days increase in China is little more than that, and has to be corrected. But it's really not a massive increase in inventory. We don't know what distribution would do, whatever they buy from us, it's not our revenue until they sell it out.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect, guys. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","You're welcome.","Operator","","We'll now take our next question from Gilbert Alexander with Darfield Associates.","Gilbert Alexander - Darfield Associates","","Hi, good afternoon. You've answered basically my questions. I would ask one thing. This softness is it basically at the contract manufacturer's level?","Steve Sanghi","","The softness is not at a contract manufacturer\u2019s level. The softness is in a customer demand level. If somebody in the June economy wanted to build 100,000 widgets, in September and December economy he wants to build 95,000 widgets.","And you know, when the demand is down 4%, 5% then they are drawing that much less from distribution. If you were building it to your level, then distribution had that excess inventory they've got to bleed out.","","Gilbert Alexander - Darfield Associates","","All right. Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi","You are welcome, sir.","Operator","","We'll now go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Thanks, for taking my question. Just on the attempted acquisition, or the proposal for Cambridge Silicon Radio. Can you talk a little more of what the strategy was there? Are you looking for more Bluetooth technology beyond what ISSC has?","Steve Sanghi","","Well, the basic Bluetooth technology we got from ISSC and it's very good, as good as any we could get. But ISSC revenue is $17 million a quarter and CSR had substantial scale and beyond scale, they also have the location technology.","But we looked at CSR like any other acquisition would look at. At any point in time, we have three, four, five companies either we're talking to or getting with or doing the analysis. As we valued it, unfortunately our interest became public during the process, due to some leak somewhere. Otherwise you would have never known.","","But after total diligence and was really a disciplined approach we have, and our track record of successful acquisitions, we were unable to reach a valuation for CSR that would support making the kind of offer they got from the other company, it was just that simple.","","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","","I see. I wonder if I could just change subjects slightly and go to the utilization. With your foundries, have you cut back orders at foundries also?","","Steve Sanghi","","We have cut back orders in foundries also yes.","","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","","Okay. Thank you.","","Steve Sanghi","","Yes.","Operator","","We will now take our next quarter from Liwen Zhang with Blaylock Van.","Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Would you please comment on your 8-bit business as you did the last quarter? That would be helpful.","Steve Sanghi","Comment on the 8-bit business.","Ganesh Moorthy","","So, you know, we don't break out all the different segments every single quarter. We made an exception to that last quarter about the 8-bit. Suffice to say overall microcontrollers were up and there's a number of moving parts within it. You can see what the growth on 16 and 32 were. You can draw your own conclusions from it.","","Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van","","Okay, thank you. Also, for the MCU industry and especially you have a lot of exposure to Asia-Pacific, what kind of a competition are you seeing there, also, the pricing strategies, offer to buy local MCU products? Thank you.","","Steve Sanghi","","I seem to recall you asked the same question yesterday in another conference call. The local Asian MCU competitors are not a challenge. There is no new competitors, there is nothing going on. That's not the issue here.","We're not really seeing any major competition there. A few commodity guys making low end parts. There's really no formidable Asian competitor, other than the Japanese competitor like Renesas who's really a competitor to us.","","I do want to add another comment to Ganesh's answers on 8-bit. We don't want people to walk away with 8-bit having any kind of issues. In the June quarter 8-bit was an all-time record. In September 8-bit was also all-time record, but including a small amount of ISSC revenue which was taken as microcontroller. Without that it was down a little bit.","So there is really no immediate 8-bit issue. We don't normally break out the numbers and all that, because of sensitivity on the competition front.","Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van","","Thanks. That's all I have.","","Steve Sanghi","","You're welcome.","","Operator","","We will now take our final question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Thanks for taking the question and I hopped on late, so I apologize if this was asked and addressed. Steve, could you just put into context the order slow down, and then what appears to be an improvement in that condition recently?","How does what you saw compare to what you've seem historically, shorter, longer, more severe, less severe? Can you just put some context around what you're seeing in the business, and the degree to which it's highly localized versus very broad based?","Steve Sanghi","I think we have seen the shallow, couple of quarter correction before, and we're seeing it again. It's nothing like late 2008, and it's nothing like year 2000. But some of these smaller inventory corrections that have come every couple of years or so, it's really one of those.","This is a very mild one. And then I think we get out of that with a probably 5%, kind of or less than that, total cut and what we were thinking before was what we're thinking before.","You've got to exclude the ISSC, otherwise it complicates numbers. But if you exclude them we missed it by about 4% last quarter. Our current quarter guidance is seasonal or within 0.5% of seasonal. So you're talking 4%, 4.5% kind of total cut. I would consider that to be fairly mild, if it doesn't really go any worse, which we are not expecting.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","In the past \u2013and I think this was more of a 2007 dynamic, but there have been times when there's been an application-specific issue related to some of the softness that you have seen.","Did you detect any of that in the recent period, or was it across various application groups or end markets to the extent that you see them?","Steve Sanghi","Well, you know, so my feeling is that US business is good for everybody, and was good for us. Europe business is also fine. You read the headlines in Europe. Germany is teetering on the brink of recession and all that. I'm not sure all that was seen before. If it gets any worse then it's different, but otherwise Europe business is fine, too.","The problem is mostly all in Asia and there are a large number of headlines coming out of China, with a significant GDP drop or slowest industrial production in 5 years, crash in housing, automotive build is low in China.","So I think as far as China is concerned, my feeling is with the exception of the companies which are exposed to one guy in Cupertino, excluding that, it's broad based.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Okay. And then lastly, in the release in early October, you identified that you thought the business would return to growth in the first calendar quarter. Is that still the expectation, and can you quantify the degree to which you think the business could grow?","Steve Sanghi","","We're not giving a guidance numerically, but we think first quarter should be about seasonal.","","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","","Thank you.","","Operator","We have no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","","Okay. Well, we want to thank everyone for going through this period and listening to our long commentary here. We'll see some of you at the CSFP in Scottsdale, which we will be attending. It's our home state, and we'll see some of you there. Thank you.","","Operator","","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"14709":["Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) Q1 2013 Earnings Call August  2, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","James Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Vice President of Finance","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating officer and Executive Vice President","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Gordon W.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Eric Bjornholt","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and our results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter of fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environments and discuss our guidance. We will then provide an update on our acquisition of SMSC and be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","Before I jump into the details, I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensations. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were $352.4 million and were up 4% from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were about $250,000 higher than GAAP net sales as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date of an acquisition. This $250K difference relates to our April acquisition of Roving Networks. We expect we will have larger differences in the coming quarters in our GAAP and non-GAAP net sales due to the acquisition of SMSC.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59% in the June quarter and non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.3% of sales. Operating income was 32.7% of sales and net income was $96.9 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance.","On a full GAAP basis, net sales were $352.1 million and gross margins, including share-based compensations and acquisition-related expenses, were 57.7% in the June quarter. Total operating expenses were $106.7 million or 30.3% of sales and includes share-based compensations of $8.7 million and acquisition-related expenses of $5.5 million. GAAP net income was $78.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share.","In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 13.4%. The tax rate was impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various non-recurring items.","We expect our forward-looking effective tax rate with the combination of Microchip and SMSC on a non-GAAP basis to be about 13% to 14%. And I remind you that this is without any benefit from the R&D tax credit, which has currently expired and has not yet been reinstated.","To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.043. Acquisition-related items were about $0.04 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006.","The dividend declared today of $0.3501 per share will be paid on September 5, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 22, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $68.2 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at June 30, 2012, was $221.5 million or 136 days, down 1 day from the prior-quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors continue to be at historically low levels at 31 days, flat to the prior quarter. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At June 30, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $174.7 million, an increase of 2.6% from the balance as of the end of March. Receivable balances are in great condition, an excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.","As of June 30, Microchip had a record cash and total investment position of approximately $1.82 billion. During the June quarter, we generated free cash flow of $101.4 million prior to dividend payments. Excluding our acquisition of SMSC, SMSC's cash flow and dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $110 million in the September quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $10 million for the June quarter, and well below our original forecast of $18 million. With some of the June capital plan rolling into September, we expect about $20 million capital spending this quarter excluding any SMSC capital expenditures.","We have reduced our overall capital expenditure forecast for the fiscal year from $70 million to $60 million, again excluding any SMSC capital requirements. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $20.7 million, which was down from depreciation of $20.9 million in the March quarter.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. And let's start with microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller business was up 5.1% on a sequential basis in the June quarter, with all 3 microcontroller businesses up sequentially. During the quarter, we marked another milestone as we shipped our 11 billionth cumulative microcontroller.","Our 16-bit business was up 23.7% sequentially in the June quarter and up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter to achieve an all-time record. After a pause in the March quarter, our 32-bit business is up a whopping 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve another new record. Our 32-bit business was also up 118.5% from the year-ago quarter. Both the 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses continue to benefit from the many demand creation actions we have taken as more customers who have selected to pick microcontroller platform either commence production or ramp their volumes.","Our design-win momentum remains strong. And while we're not immune to the macro business conditions, we continue to outgrow the secular growth patterns for these segments.","Moving to development tools, we shipped over 47,000 tools in the June quarter. Cumulatively, we have  now shipped close to 1.35 million development tools, and development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by customers.","Now moving to analog products. Our analog business was up strongly, with 9% sequential growth to also achieve a new record, and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. The synergy of selling more analog content around our high-end microcontrollers, combined with innovative new products and demand creation actions we have taken, are fueling the growth of our analog business. We remain pleased with the design-win momentum our analog business has shown and have a strong pipeline of more innovative new product lines that we will be unveiling over the next few months.","Now moving to our memory business. This business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products, was down 2.4% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as for our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I am speaking to you from SMSC headquarters in New York today, where we are excited to have completed the acquisition of SMSC this morning.","Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2013 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2013, including comments on the integration plan for SMSC.","Our June quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during the last earnings call. The quarter started out strong, but the negative effects of Europe, weaker economic activity in Europe and weakening economy in China led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the midpoint of our guidance in revenue.","Gross margin was up 85 basis points sequentially, leading to an improvement in operating profit, which was about 32.7% of sales.  Our licensing business was down 4.8% sequentially. Our licensing business tends to trail industry manufacturing output by approximately 1 quarter and reflects the manufacturing inventory correction by foundries in IDMs over the prior 2 quarters. However, we did sign 2 new license agreements with 2 major foundry customers last quarter, both of them will be the users of SST flash for the very first time and will help us expand our penetration in the use of SST flash in the embedded world. We continue to build a strong foundation for future growth with these 2 new significant license agreements signed in the June quarter.","I will now provide guidance for the September quarter including SMSC revenues. Our guidance is based on the economic data points we are getting that say that Europe's economic recovery has stalled. Europe will continue to be in the doldrums and is made worse so by the summer holidays. And China, which has been the engine of growth, is starting to slow down.","In preparing our guidance, we have done bottoms-up analysis region-by-region, distributor-by-distributor and by major customers. We have also included SMSC revenue from today to the end of the quarter as we understand it.","We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $412 million to $430 million, which is up 17% to 22% sequentially. It includes about $65 million to $70 million revenue from the sales of SMSC products. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 58.5% to 59% of sales for the combined company. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 28.5% to 29.5% of sales for the combined company. And we expect to combine from being non-GAAP operating profit to be between 29% to 30.5% of sales, the Non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share.","Now we will provide you some updates on SMSC acquisition. We're excited to close the acquisition and begin the process of integration to drive shareholder value. We want to welcome all SMSC employees on this journey. In Microchip culture, employees are our greatest strengths.","Today, we would like to cover 4 subjects before I open the call for questions. First, I will explain to you how the revenue of SMSC will be consolidated into Microchip's FUT [ph] revenue reporting. Second, Ganesh will give you an update on the integration planning. Third, Eric will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition. And finally, I will update Microchip's long-term financial model, which will now include SMSC.","So let us begin with how the revenue of SMSC will be included in Microchip's revenue reporting. As you know, Microchip breaks its revenue reporting in 5 different imported product lines: microcontrollers, analog products, memory products, licensing and others. Over the last 3 months, we have studied SMSC's products. SMSC breaks down this revenue into 5 reported product lines: automotive, wireless audio, USB, industrial networking and computing, more end market-based rather than product-determined. Many of SMSC's products are based on the microcontroller core. They are, in fact, special-purpose microcontrollers for automotive, wireless audio or computing applications. These are not in most specialty microcontrollers than touch controllers are for mobile phone applications that many of our investors are very familiar with.","In SMSC's 10-Q filing on June 10, 2012, SMSC reported $103 million of revenue for their quarter ended May 31, 2012. If such revenue had been on Microchip's clock, we would have reported 43% of their revenue as microcontroller product revenue. The remaining 57% of the products are mixed signal\/analog products, which we would have added to our analog product revenue.","SMSC's mixed signal\/analog products sell into many markets like automotive, PC, industrial and consumer, and we expect that they will benefit from Microchip's broad penetration in a large horizontal customer base. Similarly, we expect Microchip's microcontrollers, analog and memory products will find home in more automotive, wireless audio and computing customers with SMSC.","As of today, we do not expect that the acquisition of SMSC will create any additional report about product lines. SMSC's revenue will be included with Microchip's microcontroller and analog revenue reported product lines. This is perhaps too much made of Microchip being a horizontal market company and SMSC being a vertical market company. Over the last decade, Microchip has added vertical market resources in the area of automotive, home appliances, medical, Smart Energy, digital power, motor control, lighting and several other market segments. We see the acquisition of SMSC as a natural addition to Microchip's continued growth and penetration into certain vertical markets. The addition of SMSC will add wireless audio and computing as 2 additional vertical markets for Microchip. The automotive market is already a significant area of focus on Microchip. It's not something we break out, but we have broad automotive penetration and we do business with nearly every tier 1 automotive manufacturers. Microchip has devices in many hundreds of car and truck models around the world. For example, there are over 20 Microchip microcontrollers on the current model of the Mercedes S-Class cars.","So I will now pass it on to Ganesh, who will give you update on our integration planning. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Steve. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have engaged in extensive discussions with the management of SMSC to understand their business, organization and systems. We have developed a detailed integration plan that we have begun to execute starting today.","SMSC currently runs 5 product groups: the automotive products group, the wireless audio product group, the USB product group, industrial and networking product group and the computing group. Microchip will continue to run these 5 product groups.","At Microchip, we call the product groups as divisions. But essentially, they are the same, and there's no difference between  a product group versus a division, as the 2 different companies have called it.","There could be some movement of specific products from SMSC divisions to Microchip divisions or vice versa, as we fine tune the organization and look for synergies and execution.","We have also studied the business systems of both companies. We have laid out a plan that will combine the best of both systems of the 2 companies. The 2 companies will operate on a single set of business systems, and the estimate of this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2013.","In regards to manufacturing, SMSC is established company and uses many of the same wafer foundries that Microchip uses for acquiring some of our wafers. We do not expect that Microchip will bring any SMSC products to our in-house wafer fabs. SMSC subcontracts 100% of its assembly and 90% of its test. Many of the packages that SMSC uses are different than Microchip's packages. The final test systems that SMSC uses are also different than Microchip's test systems. Therefore, we expect that the majority of the assembly and test of SMSC products will remain with subcontractors.","We will continue to do a make-versus-buy analysis for newly developed products and expect to ship the mix to Microchip assembly and test when it is cost-effective.","Microchip will, however, combine the manufacturing systems. These are wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all SMSC products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems by the start of a new year on January 1, 2013 or earlier.","Regarding field sales and applications, we have done a thorough analysis of the sales and application structure of SMSC. Over the last decades, as Steve said, while Microchip had a predominantly horizontal sales force, we have selectively added vertical marketing capability in several areas like automotive, home appliances, medical, Smart Energy, digital power, et cetera. We believe that SMSC's sales force will help us expand our vertical market capabilities further in the areas of wireless, audio and computing. We are, therefore, planning to keep SMSC's sales and applications engineers and will add them to our vertical market sales force in conjunction with the horizontal sales force that we have.","Many of the large multinational customers may see a combined effort by the 2 sales forces. Many other accounts will continue to be called on by either the Microchip or the SMSC salespersons with many cross-selling opportunities.","We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. Many of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, but many are also different, and our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies.","Finally, in regards to human resources, we expect to combine the human resource systems as well. This includes the compensation plans, medical and dental benefit plans, equity plans and all other benefit plans like 401(k), vacation benefits, et cetera. But this combination of plans could take some time, and certain combinations will be more convenient for the beginning of the new calendar year. Meanwhile, SMSC will continue to operate with their current plans.","And with this, I will now pass it on to Eric, who will provide guidance with accretion from the SMSC merger. Eric?","James Eric Bjornholt","Thanks, Ganesh. With the rate at which we expect the integrations to progress, we currently expect the SMSC acquisition to be accretive in the current September quarter by about $0.03 per share on a non-GAAP basis. During our acquisition announcement on May 2, 2012, we had said that we expect the acquisition to be accretive in the first full quarter after close. We have now pulled the accretion schedule in and expect the acquisition to be accretive starting the partial September quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect that the acquisition will add approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to Microchip's non-GAAP EPS for the December 2012 quarter. For the March 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion to increase to about $0.07 to $0.08 per share. And for the June 2013 quarter, we expect to be in the full range of accretion, which is expected to be about $0.08 to $0.09 per share per quarter. These numbers are preliminary and depends upon the speed of the integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts to continue to report their non-GAAP estimates the first call.","With that, I will pass the call back to Steve, who will provide you Microchip's long-term model including SMSC. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","As you very well know, Microchip has maintained a premium financial model for gross margin, operating expenses and operating profit for a very long time. Every time we do an acquisition, where the target's operating business model is not at par with Microchip, there is substantial speculation regarding what the acquisition will do to Microchip's combined business model.","Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. In the case of SMSC, we expect to implement substantial business process improvements to include gross margin percentage, lower operating expenses and substantially increase its operating profit.","Our long-term model for the combined company will be a gross margin of about 60%, plus or minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%; and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP.","This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of an outlook in terms of what you're seeing from customer order rates by different geographies whether you expect -- which geographies do you expect to be up or down in the next quarter?","Steve Sanghi","Well, if you recall the guidance we provided on sales, all the growth is coming from the partial SMSC quarter added to our numbers. If you take the midpoint of our guidance minus the SMSC revenue of $65 million to $70 million, Microchip is flat to up with just 0.2%, 0.3% or so. In terms of geography, Europe's geography is very weak, made worse so in some of the quarter as we said. So that will definitely be down. And the other geographies of U.S. and Asia were largely -- make up for the drop in Europe.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe just address the R&D line in terms of absolute dollars? I understand where you're talking about in terms of long-term percentages, but can you maybe talk about whether you expect R&D to drift up or whether you are not trying to reign that in over the next 2 quarters and add to the dollar basis?","Steve Sanghi","Well, if you add substantial R&D of SMSC together with Microchip, then those numbers will trend down as we gain synergies and make some restructure and changes, if that's what your question is. But if you compare it to a Microchip R&D number as we had it last quarter, of course numbers will go up because there's substantial R&D from SMSC being added.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Of course, but the combined R&D should slow down over time in terms of dollars?","Steve Sanghi","Well, it should go down short-term in dollars and long-term in percentages, yes.","James Eric Bjornholt","Right. So we're not giving any specifics of the breakout of the operating expenses at this point in time, Jim. So we've shared the long-term model on what we expect this quarter. So that shows that operating expenses should trend down, but we haven't given specifics on any particular line item.","Steve Sanghi","See, we have a partial SMSC this quarter and then there'll be full SMSC next quarter for the total operating expenses including R&D or as R&D itself are going to rise in September and rise in December because of SMSC.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, on SMSC, to achieve the targets, do you think you will have to get rid of any of the businesses? Or do you think that you can get it to those targets with the current mix of business that they have?","Steve Sanghi","So there is no selling of the business involved in getting to those targets. But there's a -- because the definite restructuring within the business itself using the combined energy of the 2 companies, using synergy in R&D, synergy in sales, synergy in operations, IT, finance and other things.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And for my follow-up, would you care to give us any sort of long-term revenue growth target for the combined company?","Steve Sanghi","It's too early in the year. We just started today.","Operator","And next, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just a follow-up to Chris' follow-up. Relative to kind of understanding when you can get the revenue synergies, clearly, the accretion guidance makes the financial rationale for this acquisition readily impaired. But as you think about either trying to leverage your distribution channel or SMSC distribution channel or curtain vice versa or your customer base, when do you start to think you'll see dividends on the top line from them?","Steve Sanghi","Well, nearly all of their products are proprietary and a very high portion of Microchip's products are proprietary. And you know that proprietary products, they take anywhere from lower 6 months for design win to as long as 1.5 year, 2 years in design before they go to production. So when some of the low hanging fruit from distribution, from each of the distribution in customers, we could get that in 6 to 9 months, but some of it will take longer. And it's also by product. We take much longer in automotive for us to sell into their customers, for them to sell into our customers. But it will be quicker in consumer and it could be quicker in the PC segments. Some industrial segments, especially the USB products and Ethernet products are very, very good products for our broad horizontal customer base with regard with selling to 70,000 customers. And those are easier products to get designed and also relative to automotive.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe, Ganesh, as a follow-up. Can you just remind us how much of SMSC's business was done through distribution and what percent do you think your distribution overlap versus new distribution opportunity when you look at the revenue stream?","Ganesh Moorthy","I'm going to hand that to Eric. Eric, do you remember the percentages of their existing business in distribution?","James Eric Bjornholt","I believe it's somewhere between 25% and 30%. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. I don't know if Gordon might.","Gordon W. Parnell","Yes. Actually, it's closer to 30%.","James Eric Bjornholt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, well, first of all, congratulations on closing the deal. I know you're trying to keep the product groups and the divisions, but are there any overlaps you've seen at this point that may be areas of easy consolidation by which of, by way of eliminating one and to help create some [indiscernible] synergy? And how much is that?","Steve Sanghi","So there isn't much of product overlap per se. It's like they don't make horizontal general-purpose microcontrollers. 43% of the business is microcontrollers, but they are specialty microcontrollers for automotive, for wireless audio, for computing embedded control and things like that. But there is a substantial overlap in the R&D development because to do a specialty microcontroller, you have to do a large amount of R&D to really build the panel, build the I\/Os, build the analog, having an extension, analog library, some of the IT you may have to buy or build from inside or outside, Ethernet, USB, converters, flip-flops, and on and on and on. There are hundreds of circuits that are developed and then you get those circuits and put them together to build a chip. So there is a substantial synergy in developing that library because we develop it today at Microchip and they develop at SMSC. Now some of it comes very quickly, but some of it takes a little bit of time because number one, 2 companies may not be at the same foundry or in the same process node. So the current products will continue where they're being developed, but as we look forward on the even 3 or 6 months forward, the new product design starts. We will try to converge them on similar processes at the same foundries, so these libraries have synergy. There is a large amount of library developed at Microchip, at foundries where SMSC is bringing some of their products. So they could be idiot users of our libraries. Similarly, we are going to certain foundries with some of our products where they're already present, so we can use their library. That's where the R&D synergy comes from.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And let me just ask you separately, if I look at the 60% long-term gross margin targets, can you help me rank order the -- what of -- are you comfortable either way, end market or by product group? How the gross margin contribution will come? And I'm asking this question specifically while the when I look at areas like USB and some of the computing product areas that they generally carry lower gross margins? And I'm wondering whether how that fits into the long-term vision of the combined company, as especially given its gross margin targets?","Steve Sanghi","So your information is not correct, that they carry lower gross margin. A lot of people looking at some of our competitors, also to microcontrollers carry lower gross margins or 8-bit carry lower gross margins or those assumptions have been wrong regarding Microchip also. We know how to make gross margin. And SMSC actually did very well in gross margins. They actually, last quarter, already was about 58%, I think. So I think the numbers you quoted, that those has no gross margin, is incorrect. It may be correct in general, if you look at the other people that build the commodity products to the business, but they were building other proprietary products. Overall gross margin is very good for the company. It's very good for Microchip. And our gross margin has been down a little bit because of absorption, because the revenue has been down because of the recession. When our fab fill up again as the business comes back, you know our gross margin goes into low 60s again like always. And their gross margin is very rough. So the guidance we gave you on overall gross margin of 60% is solid.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just first, the question on SMSC. Now that you obviously, you've done a lot more homework on the integration now and presented the plan, as you look prior to -- compared to when you're doing due diligence as you announced the deal, what's the biggest surprises that you've seen either on the positive or negative now that you've had a chance to dig in deeper?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the negative surprise largely has been the time it took to get approval from China. Although the people, lawyers working on it have told us it's very rare that a company gets approval in phase 1 in China, and this is the fastest any company has gotten. I think ADI's yield took 5, 6 months. But with all the deals that we have done, public deals and others, negative surprise was it took about 30 days longer than we would have liked. The positive surprises, I think of [indiscernible] and then understand it better. And probably original assessment was hedged and we are more confident as we have closed the deal and risked covering the deal. Closing has gone away as we have looked into the IT systems, the financial systems, the R&D understand the library, the processes, where to do business and all that. And I think we feel very confident and very, very good about it, and as we work with very good, talented employees, many them, we have worked with for the last 3 months with obviously, a fair amount of restriction in really what we could get because the companies have to operate independently. But we are very positive and very confident that as we engage in the coming weeks, this thing will be a great acquisition.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, just with respect to the core Microchip business, I, for one, have been surprised that with the things have slowed down on the macro as they have. Can you talk about what you guys are doing from a manufacturing standpoint, perhaps from a cost standpoint to deal with the current situation and where we go from here?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I mean our current situation isn't drastic like it could be for some other people. I mean, we are -- we have a solid gross margin. Our inventory days are flat. Actually, we were down by 1 day, so we don't really consider a situation to be anything that really needs correction. Business grew in the March quarter. It grew in the June quarter, maybe not as much as we wanted to, but it's a sizable growth. Our microcontroller business was up 5%. Our analog business was up 9%, so the reductions came from licensing and some of the other memory businesses. Some of it was subcontracts. So our products are doing well. And I think we'll -- our plan is to run the factory flat, both in the front end and back end, and inventory will continue to come down slowly. And eventually, there will be an upturn and the factory will fill up again.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a final point. With running the factories flat in the near term, what do you expect inventory, your own inventory to do in the near term as a result of that?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so at last quarter's production, our inventory went down by 1%. So if nothing else changes, then our inventory should go down maybe by another day. Although the distribution is a different equation, so the distribution inventory was nearly all-time low.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, it's 31 days.","Steve Sanghi","31 days. And the normal has been between 31 to 45. So at any point in time, if the distribution starts to rebuild inventory, then our inventory would come down substantially. And it's largely, went up here because the distribution has been keeping very low inventory. And when distribution keeps low, we want to keep it high so it's available to the channel. Now having said all that, going forward, our inventory gets mixed with the SMSC. So the inventory numbers will report next quarter, will be -- have 2 months of SMSC and then 3 months of SMSC. So it's going to be impossible to compare it to really what happened in the prior quarter in the baseline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","A question for you on SMSC going into the December quarter. SMSC is kind of tough with this -- they had an off quarter and they had a very strong November and a weak February quarter. And I guess I'm trying to figure out if maybe you could lend us some color on how we should we think about the seasonality of SMSC's business on what is now a calendar December quarter?","Steve Sanghi","So that's a very, very good question. That's something we have pondered with ourselves. Their quarter ended in November and then February. So in the February quarter, they picked 2 very bad months. One is usually the month of December, that has lots of holiday. And then January usually starts out slow after the holidays, and then you get Chinese New Year. You all get that in the one quarter. So that was a very weak quarter. And I think now on our clock in December, you will pick up the December weakness and the December quarter and the Chinese New Year will go with ours. So we'll have to get some cycles of learning. I think you can look at the prior data and do some averaging. Give us some time on our clock and I think we'll be able to help you more. But today is our first day and I think I will just be guessing.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess I'll ask you that next quarter. The other question now for you. It looks like your 8-bit MCU revenue was down slightly, sequentially in the quarter?","Steve Sanghi","Let me correct. Our 8-bit revenue was up sequentially.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","It was up sequentially? But as some call it slightly or I guess, I'll look to my data on that. The -- but as a lead indicator, 8-bit based on your -- on Steve's general comments on the cycle that you've given us in the past, I guess I'm looking if you could give us your opinion on what you think on the cycle on demand going forward here for the next couple of quarters?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the September quarter, we've given you guidance already. And December quarter, usually the weak quarter for Microchip historically, if you look at it. So this quarter and next quarter, given the backdrop of the economy, of fiscal cliff rating, election's coming, Europe in doldrums, I think the hope is on China, there is some activity in China to try to come up with a new fiscal package. And when China comes up with fiscal packages, that's really to promote usually home appliances and automotive and other stuff for their consumers to buy. We benefited very well when that happened the last time. There is some talk of that right now. If that happens, we'll do very well. And China is the largest geography now. We ship more in China than U.S. But Europe will be weak and U.S. is anybody's guess, I think, if there is no breakthrough in Washington, U.S. will continue to be where it is, more of the same.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you say what similar customer feedback has been on the merger acquisition?","Steve Sanghi","So the -- when the deal was first announced, obviously, some customers get nervous regarding what Microchip might do. And a lot of this nervousness is actually deferred, fear uncertainty and doubt created by either the competitors or the analysts, honestly, and I'll tell you why. It is to competitor's benefit to go to major customers and say, \"Oh, Microchip today, high margin company. They're different there. Look at the profitability. They're not going to support this. They are not going to support that.\" I expect them to do so because if I'm the competitor of somebody, I'll do the same. The analysts, with lack of information, very little information is available on May 2 when we announced. A lot of reports come out, some guessing we'll sell the USB. We'll do this. We'll do that. We'll not support this. We'll not support that. And people read that, too, and that makes them nervous regarding the programs they continually have won. So SMSC work very well together. Their management, kudos to them, reached out to us when there were some significant high and large customer concerns, and we made some joint calls to the customers to make them feel comfortable. And in today's call, as people are hearing officially, we're going to keep all the divisions and all the products, keep their sales force, should really alleviate any remaining concerns. Actually, there haven't been concerns after the initial one, which we satisfy.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And also other customers, maybe in the automotive, where with your larger scale, that you'd build 1 plus 1 could equal 2.5 or so?","Steve Sanghi","Yes. I mean, absolutely. Even in the last 3 months, I have visited Microchip's automotive customers where they also wanted to talk about SMSC. In most cases, we could not because -- anti trust issues and all that when it wasn't clear that there is very high interest in SMSC's customers. Microchip is a very good supplier to them. I gave you an example. We have over 20 microcontrollers in Mercedes S-Class cars, and there's a great relationship there to -- with their suppliers and all that. So obviously, they want to talk to us.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, first question I have for you is, is there any color you can offer up on when exactly you're starting to see the weakness in your business in the June quarter? And then, in July, is that just state, low at -- flat at a low level exiting Q2, has there been any pickup or deterioration? Any color you can provide would be appreciated?","Steve Sanghi","So if you look at it, we actually made that quarter. Our guidance was 3 to 7 for midpoint of 5 when we came in at 4. So a slight weakness. And I think most of that came in second half of the quarter. At our earnings call, which was on May 2 or 3 time frame, we had given that guidance. So, so far at that time, we were okay. And the weakness developed later on. I think the last month, specially June, was weak and the late part of May could have been weaker here with week 2.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then any color on July?","Steve Sanghi","It's continuing at that pace. That's why we're guiding roughly flat.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as my follow-up, growth in your 16- and 32-bit business is obviously very impressive, but seems like although 8-bit grew, it probably grew very modestly. Any thoughts there? And at least compare those with some of the other guys reporting their 8-bit business, which was a little bit better, is it just a timing issue in your opinion or an exposure issue from an end market or product-cycle basis?","Steve Sanghi","It's -- it could be anything. It could be end market exposure, the more exposed to automotive, which was our strongest segments. It could be geography. It could be where the business is. And we have substantial growth in 16, 32. Our 8-bit business also is larger than most of those -- so their 8-bit businesses is smaller. So it could be a starting issue at some time. I can't compare to other people's numbers because I don't know what happened in their business.","Operator","And we'll move next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First of all, congratulations on closing the deal. And thanks for the accretion schedule. That's very helpful. But just a quick question on that, Steve. Are you just assuming cost cuts at this point in time when -- with the accretion schedule that you gave us, so you're building in some sort of cross-selling incentives? So could you give us an idea of how we should think of cross sales?","Steve Sanghi","The accretion schedule that I have given you for now through March and June does not really have revenue synergy in it. As I mentioned earlier, if I want a design tomorrow, we'll be 9 months to production at least. Those are the fastest schedules and most will take longer. So the accretion schedule we have given you is largely through synergy and cost savings and longer.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. Steve, and then another follow-up question for you was, SMSC obviously, lower gross margins, lower operating margins compared to Microchip. And I'm not asking for numbers, but I'm just curious of qualitatively, you could give us a hint or some idea of what areas do you see the most supreme? And would it be COGS? Would it be OpEx? And any kind of color would be helpful?","Steve Sanghi","So I cannot break it down much for you. I think based on SMSC's public number and ours, you might be able to do some triangulation. I've given you synergy and you guys are the model on odd numbers. For me to further break it down, I think it will be telling you guys before the employees have heard it and all that so...","Operator","And we'll move next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I was hoping you could provide a little bit more details on how to think about the new employee stock plan for the SMSC guys and how that would affect the non-GAAP to GAAP translations?","Steve Sanghi","So all vested stock options of SMSC were cashed out now essentially at the deal price. All unvested equity was assumed. And what we have in our share count, I believe, the guidance table has noted the bottom that shows about 700,000 shares dilution.","James Eric Bjornholt","We did shares from that. That's not the number of shares that come into the plans.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, so -- but there's 700,000 shares added to Microchip's otherwise share count for September quarter because of the options we're assuming. Is your question related to this inducement plan that we filed today?","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, that was the one.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. So FUC -- I'm sorry, SMSC had a shared appreciation rights plan, which was the cash settled. So they -- an employee gets a certain number of SARs, which are good for 10 years. And after they are vested, they could really, at any point in time, exercise it. And from strike price to the fair market value, they get cash from SMSC. All the vested ones, SARs were cashed out also. The unvested ones are being converted to this inducement plan, and there are about 440,000 shares in that plan. So that's the number, 440,000. The dilution is not all of them because there's a strike price also. So the dilution is already in the 700,000 shares. So whatever comes out of the SAR dilution is already included in the other 700,000 number I gave you. And you can basically ignore this new plan we filed. That's more -- we didn't have a plan like that to convert, so we put a plan like that. But the number that's important to you is already in our guidance table. That fully is inclusive of all invested equity.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thanks for the clarity. I appreciate that. Then we could just go back to your higher responding to this global weakening. I'm wondering if you're doing anything about plant shutdowns? Or is there any natural days off this quarter because of vacations? Well, it seems to have come to an end last quarter. So I'm wondering perhaps summer vacations are giving you a bit of  latitude there to allow utilization rates to fall. Could you provide some hints as to that?","Steve Sanghi","There's nothing we need to do in business than we are doing. And like I said earlier, we don't feel that our inventory is alarming. No, it's not 160 days or something. Inventory is probably high by 15 days or so or to what I will think comfortable. We're at 120 and 133, 13 days. I'm not -- I don't need to do a -- I have enough on my plate to get accretion from SMSC, manage the business, restructure it, get synergies from other teams. So we don't really need to do any shutdowns. We don't need to do anything. I think if the business falls off for any reason further, which we're not expecting, we don't have a crisis at hand. We're not [indiscernible]. The business isn't down like some of the other companies. It's really doing fine. Our business compared to a year ago was down...","James Eric Bjornholt","5.9%.","Steve Sanghi","5.9%. I mean, that's just -- the framework you guys are in, where you're reading, what other people are doing. And so you're asking us what we're doing. The business is only down 5.9% versus a year ago. The company gross margin is 59%. Operating profit is 32.7%. And those kind of numbers, we're not in a crisis situation. We don't have to do anything.","Operator","And we'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This question is a little bit of a high-level question. And that is, how long will it take you to unify some of the design tools so that a client will be able to use those Microchip blocks and SMSC blocks together in a unified development environment? How long will that take? And will that present more of a significant opportunity to then recognize revenue synergy from the merger?","Steve Sanghi","I will forward that to Ganesh. I think he has looked at it more closely.","Ganesh Moorthy","Well, I think for some time to come, the tools are going to be different. They are not impediments for the customer. In many cases, the customer was doing a design with a set of tools. It will take us some time to assess what combination of tools makes sense. It doesn't make sense in all cases, and then we'll make those changes as appropriate. But I don't see any impediments to customers to adopt either our product, if they're an SMSC customer, or an SMSC product, if they're an existing Microchip customer using the tools we have today. And it's just we can make enhancements and there'll be improvements as we go along. But there are no impediments.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then one my follow-up was a broader economic question. I think, Steve, in the past, you've talked about Microchip seeing inflections in the economy a little bit earlier than peers. It sounds like you really haven't seen improvement in your order rates yet, yet there's some other peers who are seeing stronger second halfs due to application exposure and whatnot. I guess my question is, based on your experience, would you have expected to have seen improvement in the economy by this point? And I guess, another way of asking that, other peers you are seeing improvements in the second half, do you think it's just the seasonal build and they are yet to see a contraction again in the first half of next year?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the economies at the low point, and for all we know, it could get further worse with what's happening in Europe. And I don't know if I completely understand your question. The question I would have expected is, \"Why didn't you see the weakness earlier that we always see?\" You're asking a question, \"Why didn't we see the improvement?\" And I'm not sure business is improving right now. But the question I expected that I'd like to answer is, \"Why didn't we see the weakness earlier this time?\" We always see the weakness a quarter earlier. Well, we would have seen the weakness a quarter earlier if our superior growth of 16-bit, 32-bit and analog and positive sequential growth on analog, both June quarter and March quarter, had an overcoming. That's why we didn't see. So if we had a normal level of growth on 16, 32 and if 8-bit business was flat to down, then we would have seen the weakness compared to the industry earlier. We did see a lower run rate, customers correcting for inventory, lack of confidence, but number of new designs go to -- going to production on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog overcame it. And now the question you're asking me is, \"Why we're not seeing the improvement earlier?\" I don't know who's seeing it. And I'm watching the dust from many of our competitors. And the businesses are bad.","Operator","Next we'll go to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And congratulations on your biggest deal ever. Just from a financial reporting standpoint, it's very helpful to get the product detail. Can you provide the 16-bit business, 32-bit business analog? Will we be getting the same thing for the SMSC business in the future?","Steve Sanghi","We haven't exactly figured out what we're going to provide you. I think for reporting, as we said, the SMSC business will break into 2 pieces: microcontrollers and analog. Microcontrollers will be added to a microcontroller number, analog to an analog number, to the extent that microcontroller has 8-, 16-, 32-bit complements which they do, they will add to our respective 8, 16 and 32, if that was your question.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's the question, Steve. So in this transition period, there'll be an adjustment where you add those in. And will you be giving us some mapping to tell us how much of the SMSC business went into each of those segments for modeling?","Steve Sanghi","I think we'll do some of that, yes, not enough for you to be able to call it the 8-bit.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's touche. And then a follow-up question for Eric. Eric, it sounds like that the accretion assumptions were all expense-based and there's not a revenue contribution there. Is that correct?","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, that's correct.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I mean, in what you provided so far?","James Eric Bjornholt","That's correct. We have assumed that the revenue synergies take longer.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","I had a couple of questions. One is, can you give us the breakdown of what your revenue was by the various product areas that you -- as you usually disclose in your 10-Q?","James Eric Bjornholt","Sure. Sure, we can do that. So microcontroller revenue was $240,594,000. Memory was $40,718,000. Analog was $47,184,000. Licensing was $20,282,000. And other was $3,608,000. And those are non-GAAP numbers.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","Those are non-GAAP numbers?","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes.","Steve Sanghi","There was a $250,000 non-GAAP difference, a consumer [indiscernible].","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, that's -- it's small. I don't have those numbers in front of me right at the moment, but it's a small difference. And if you want to follow-up with me, I can give them to you.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","Okay. Also, I mean it sounds from just taking a quick look at what your guidance is, that unless the non-GAAP SMSC numbers are widely different from the GAAP SMSC numbers, it looks like you're going to see your non-SMSC revenue go down sequentially in these coming quarters. Is that correct or did I miss something in my computation?","James Eric Bjornholt","I think you missed at a few. If you back the numbers out of the $65 million to $70 million in growth, I think you'll see that there is a midpoint of slightly above flat. But it is relatively flat.","Ganesh Moorthy","So typically, midpoint of the guidance and subtract $60 million, $70.5 million out of that, you'll get a Microchip number, which is slightly north of our last quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, hopefully. First of all, Steve, you talked about the China plants. Market is potentially being an uplift in the second half. Do you have any insights as to whether that the incentive programs are going to come? And if they come back and the timing? And what's your exposure to that market will be about the term?","Steve Sanghi","I don't have the better claim to [indiscernible] for sure. No, I do not know what's the status of those programs and whether they will be implemented.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Are you seeing anything in the order patterns that might indicate people building up for that?","Steve Sanghi","No.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then the second question really is around synergies with SMSC. Should we think, all things being equal to revenue, synergies are more from SMSC's autos business and the consumer businesses versus their computing businesses? Or is that not a fair statement?","Steve Sanghi","No, that's not a fair statement. We expect to be able to sell the USB, industrial products into our customers and the computing and automotive also. And we expect to sell some of our products into wireless audio, data synergy, automotive customers, their computing customers, large computing customers and some of the consumer customers, so it's both ways.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","So I just wanted to say thank you all for attending the conference today. It's been a very busy day for us here today, closing the acquisition and doing this call at the same time. Although it kind of worked out because after closing, we were able to give you back more information than we could have given you if the closing was next week or next month. So we'll see many of you in the conferences that will happen this quarter and we'll be at some of those. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our call for today.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.","We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on our ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.","We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website and I understand that those schedules aren\u2019t showing up right away but we should have that issue corrected very shortly here for all of you.","I want to remind listeners that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to the distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer.","As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and each quarter we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand.","End-market demand in the June 2019 quarter was $1.35 billion which was up 0.7% sequentially from the March 2019 quarter. End-market demand was about $27 million more than our GAAP revenue in the June quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.","Net sales in the June quarter were $1.323 billion which was down 0.5% sequentially and slightly below the midpoint of our guidance of $1.33 billion. I remind you that our guidance for the quarter was made prior to the ban on shipments to Huawei which has historically been between a 1% and 2% revenue customer for us. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 62%, operating expenses were 25.8% of sales and operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $357.6 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a $1.41 which was $0.035 above the mid-point of our guidance of $1.375. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.6% and include the impact of $4.9 million of share based compensation, total operating expenses were $643.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.5 million, special charges of $8.1 million, $9.6 million of acquisition related and other costs and share based compensation of $35.8 million.","The GAAP net income was $50.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax benefit included $12.6 million of discrete income tax benefits primarily related to tax reserve release due to a statute of limitation expiring. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 5.5% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be between 5% and 6% exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.","We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that will that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $246 million and will be paid over seven years with $10 million of that being paid this quarter.","We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2019 was $733.1 million. We had 132 days of inventory at the end of June, up four days from the prior quarters level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 32 days compared to 35 days at the end of March. We believe that barring any negative developments on the U.S., China trade front, our distributors are holding a reasonable albeit lower than normal level of inventory to support end-market demand.","The cash flow from operating activities was $380.6 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $437.1 million, we paid down $257.5 million of total debt in the June quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $263.7 million. Our EBITDA in the June quarter was $537.1 million and our trailing 12-month EBITDA was $2.212 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and as more equity like in nature was 4.65 at June 30, 2019. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.","Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $87.1 million, capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the June quarter, we expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $110 million and $130 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business particularly for the outsource Actel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.","Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $46.2 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Also with the start of a new fiscal year and a full-year of Microsemi results under our belt, we are making an adjustment to our product line reporting for our conference calls.","We will continue to provide product line reporting for microcontrollers, analog and FPGA which make up almost 90% of our revenue. We will report licensing, memory and MMO or multi-market and other as a fourth category called LMO which stands for licensing memory and other which is about 10% of our revenue. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business was sequentially up 1.8% compared to the March quarter reflecting some strength in what otherwise continues to be broad macro weakness in the markets we serve.","During the quarter, we shipped our 25 billionth microcontroller, a milestone in our rich heritage as a microcontroller solutions provider. We also continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers including several new touch screen microcontrollers with industry leading noise immunity with screen sizes of 9 to 20 inches. The industry's first commercially available Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface known as eSPI to low pin count known as LPC bridge product for industrial computers, the addition of a single port solution to our USB smart hub family targeted at entry level automotive applications.","And last but not least we unveiled our META-DX1 family of Ethernet devices the industry's first terabit scale Ethernet device that enables high density 400 Gigabit Ethernet and flexible rate Ethernet connectivity. Microcontrollers represented 53.8% of our end-market demand in the June quarter.","Now moving to analog, our analog business is sequentially down 0.7% compared to the March quarter reflecting the broad macro weakness, Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products including the production release of our 700 volt silicon carbide MOSFETs as well as our 700 Volt and 1200 volt silicon carbide Schottky barrier diodes. High precision 16 bit and 24 bit analog to digital converters and IEEE 802.3 compliant Power Over Ethernet switch and the industry's first clock buffers that meet PCIe Generation 4 and Generation 5 specifications. Analog represented 28.5% of our end-market demand in the June quarter.","Our FPGA end-market demand reached an all-time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel history with 7% sequential growth compared to the March quarter coming in at almost $101 million, the FPGA business does have some lumpiness because of our significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets where procurement timing can be a function of programs and their shifting priorities schedules and budgets.","Design wins on our new low power mid-range PolarFire family continue to grow strongly and we remain optimistic about this product family adding another leg of growth for the future. FPGA represented 7.5% of our end-market demand in the June quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product lines which we refer to as LMO was sequentially down 4.9% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter reflecting the broad macro weakness that Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing.","Collectively, LMO represented 10.2% of our end-market demand, a quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration, business units and sales have substantially completed their integration activity. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we closed the transaction despite the weaker macro environment over the last four quarters.","As we said before, Business Systems and Operations Integration will take a longest time to complete as we execute this transition in phases, we expect the overall business and operational integration will take about another 12 months to complete and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. Finally, a short update about the Huawei situation from our perspective.","We estimate that our exposure to Huawei to be approximately 1% to 2% of our end-market demand. Our revenue with Huawei is a combination of what we ship to them directly as well as what we ship indirectly to their subcontractors and in some cases through distributors. We stopped all shipments of Huawei when the Department of Commerce issued that Export Administration Regulation or EAR in May. About a month after that based on further analysis of the EAR, we began allowing shipments of Huawei for several products that were permissible to ship under the EAR.","However the benefit for the June quarter was limited as Huawei in many cases did not want the product since they could not complete their bill of materials. There remains continued uncertainty as to whether Huawei will want all that we can ship this quarter as they may or may not be able to complete their bill materials. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2020. Before I analyze our June quarter results, I want to remind everyone that our guidance for June quarter was provided before the ban on shipments to Huawei was announced. The midpoint of our guidance was flat sequentially, Huawei is approximately 1% to 2% of our revenue and about half the quarter was impacted.","Our June quarter GAAP net sales based on selling revenue recognition was down half a percent sequentially and without the Huawei ban, it would have been slightly positive. Our end-market demand based on sell-through was 0.7% up sequentially and would have been higher without the Huawei ban. The end-market demand was stronger than sell-in revenue which is consistent with our thesis that the channel is continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty.","As we stated on our February conference call, our view that the March quarter would mark the bottom for this cycle based on end-market demand is proving to be correct. This statement is also proving to be correct for GAAP revenue after excluding the impact of the Huawei ban. So given very difficult and uncertain market conditions, we are pleased with the net sales results that we have delivered. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin at 62% was right at the midpoint of our guidance.","Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.2% also was at the mid-point of our guidance. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvement in gross and operating margins for Microsemi products. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.035 per share.","On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 115th consecutive profitable quarter, a tribute to the employees of Microchip including employees from all of our acquisitions for their contribution to our success. In the June quarter, we paid down $257.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been $1.414 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions that we have experienced with some of the inventory correction quarters rolling-off from four quarter rolling calculations, we\u2019re optimistic that the peak of our debt-to-EBITDA leverage is behind us and we should see meaningful continuing reductions in leverage in future periods.","Now I will provide you guidance for the September quarter. While the uncertainty begin with U.S., China trade friction. The uncertainty has become global. Europe was the weakest geography for us during the June quarter. Our customers and distributors are blaming the weak business conditions in Europe to the effect of very weak exports to China as well as uncertainty due to Brexit.","The largest economy in Europe, Germany is near recessionary levels with auto production down significantly. Our China business was actually up recovering from the Chinese New Year with more shipping days as we expected. While there is this continued uncertainty in Europe as well as the U.S., China trade relations given the multi-quarter inventory correction we have seen at the distributors and customers, we expect net sales for our products in the September quarter to be between flat to up 4% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.8% and 62.2% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.3% and 26.3% of sales.","We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.5% and 36.9% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.37 per share to a $1.49 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and an inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its reserves on non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide for more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Great, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color by geography. As you look into the September quarter, do you expect similar trends in terms of the recent stabilization in China, Europe weakened and any thoughts on just North America, how that's holding up into September?","Steve Sanghi","So I think it should be reasonably similar. The September quarter is usually a good quarter in Asia and that should continue Asia and China but Europe should continue to be the weakest geography and America is sort of normal.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We will now take your question with Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. So Steve over the last few quarters we have seen your distributors reduced inventory, I think in the last two quarters they've gone from 36 days to 35 now, 32 days. Is this kind of the bottom and can you give us some historical context that outside of -- outside of the financial crisis, what's the lowest the distributors have gone to in terms of holding inventory?","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. So this is Eric Bjornholt. So if you look at the last 10 years, our distribution inventory days have ranged between 27 and 47. You have 32 days that's the lowest that we've definitely seen in several years. And we don't really think that it's going to go much lower than this. So I think it's probably relatively stable here. But our distributors are definitely managing their working capital requirements given the uncertainty of the environment and last quarter we had made similar commentary that we didn't think it would go much lower and it went down by about three days. But we think this is likely to bottom. But it could fluctuate by a day or two in either direction. That's definitely possible.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","Hey guys, quick question Steve. Seems like you sound a little bit more bullish than you have in the past three or four calls. I'm curious if you can share specifics. You talked a little bit but specifics of maybe what you're seeing within China that that might give you some optimism or why you might have been up, any color in product segments and you think we can go back to normal growth from here including seasonality or we're going to kind of chug along the bottom a little bit?","Steve Sanghi","Well Harsh, it's always the same saga in every cycle. We usually see the cycles coming ahead of everybody else and you sort of see it ending ahead of everybody else and we get a large amount of disbelief from the audience on both sides of the cycle. So we have -- we first experience down cycle starting in about July, August last year. So we've been in it for a year and have been reducing inventory in distribution in channel, in major OEM customers and inside and after multi-quarter inventory correction, we are actually seeing the backlog is up from prior quarter and we are seeing some strength coming back.","So that's really kind of what I'm reflecting while you're hitting some of the other people in the industry talking about multi-quarter inventory correction ahead of them because they either went into it much later or they continued to sort of I would say based on sell-in revenue recognition continue to have strong shipments into the channel which we did not do. So I think that's really what I'm reflecting. Other than that, I think there is a significant uncertainty in the U.S., China trade relations as well as Brexit deadline coming in three months. And I don't really know what will transpire there.","Harsh Kumar","Appreciate it, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Jamison calling in for Ambrish. So I was hoping you guys could talk about some of your receivables and notes that they're up about 6% quarter-on-quarter on a dollar basis and five days sequentially. And I understand that there was some classification, reclassification in your receivables last quarter. But can you talk about what is at play here or is it just a timing thing. And do you expect them to come down in the upcoming quarters? Thank you.","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. That's a good question. So there's no reclassification that's occurring this quarter. That was something that we did as part of our year-end process in March. So this is really just based on the shipment linearity in the quarter one quarter the next that drove that to be a little bit higher and we would expect that to really kind of correct itself over time and kind of be more in line with what the revenue curve is going to be in the future. So hopefully that answers your question but there's nothing unusual going on in receivables, there's no receivables are in good shape and won't have any significant bad debts or anything like that. So all that should come to cash year over time.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is regarding CapEx looks like your 2020 guidance is reducing towards $120 million which I believe is around give or take a 2% capital intensity and lower than the last several years. So I was wondering what is driving these reductions. Just lower demand and do you expect CapEx to stay around these levels in the near-term or tick back up towards the more historical 4% to 5% in the future?","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. So we were in last fiscal year, fiscal 2019 we were putting capital in place at least early in the year for an expansion environment which didn't come to fruition. So we're very well positioned from a CapEx perspective of what's in place. We've reduced the CapEx in the current year by about $20 million from when we last talked to the Street and just managing the business appropriately in that environment. So we tend to go through peaks and valleys in CapEx but I'd say over time you should expect CapEx to be in the range of 3% to 4% of sales.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Eric Bjornholt","Welcome.","Operator","We will now take your question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gary Mobley","Thanks guys. Eric I had couple questions for you on the gross margin and OpEx, I believe you are guiding for the June quarter for underutilization impact gross margin by 70 basis points. Was that the case and were you sort of discounting in your September quarter outlook and then with respect to the OpEx, non-GAAP OpEx, you're I think guiding for a $10 million sequential increase based on the midpoint of the guidance. That's the first increase in five quarters. I'm just wondering what's behind that?","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. So we'll take it one at a time. So on the gross margin side, we did have underutilization charge again this quarter, it was pretty much in line with what it was in the previous quarter it was $7.3 million, I think that's up 200K quarter-on-quarter. We're running our factories kind of at an attrition level in most cases at this point in time, so production has been coming down or inventory is higher than kind of our normal operating levels of 115 to 120.","And at this point in the cycle that is not unusual but overtime we do want to bring that inventory balance down. So that's really hit on gross margin. On OpEx, you're right we are guiding to an increase and we've managed operating expenses very tightly really since the September 2018 quarter and have really kind of beaten our guidance on OpEx in September, December and March quite significantly and came in kind of at the target in the current quarter and running the business conservatively but there are investments that we feel we need to continue to make in this business to drive the ongoing health of our business and future growth opportunities.","So we view that change is relatively small in the current quarter as a percentage of revenue, it is targeted to be flat at the midpoint of guidance at 25.8%.","Gary Mobley","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","We'll now take a question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results considering such a tough demand environment. I'm hoping you can quantify the dollar savings or the synergies that are remaining with regard to the Microsemi acquisition and your anticipated timing on achieving those? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","So I think we can order that genetically because really not at this point in time breaking results out. We had guided at the end of first year of our synergy to be at the radar for $0.75 per share on an annualized basis. We can tell you that we\u2019re ahead of it, after one year we have really exceeded those targets. And then the longer-term three years synergy targets that we had identified were $1.75 which were and you can pick the second year numbers somewhere in between $0.75 and $1.75 and the $1.75 number was consisting of three items although we didn't provide a breakdown of those three items, one was the OpEx synergy, second one was COGS synergy with bringing stuff inside and improving gross margin.","And the third one was the benefit coming from sales, incremental sales growth and all that. There was actually a fourth item which was tax although we originally did not mention tax. So as we look at it about a year and a quarter after, we are head of synergy targets on the expenses, we\u2019re ahead of our synergy targets on the COGS side and we are ahead of our synergy targets on the tax side. So three out of four are ahead and one we are behind which is that revenue largely driven by the environment that we face. So that's kind of where we are.","William Stein","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess a question on some of the ongoing trade tensions and specifically some of the new tariffs are going to come into place. I know Steve you've been watching this closely with respect to your business. And I guess with this next round, do you expect any activity from the channel kind of pull forward, push outs as a result of that or going on long enough now that maybe there's some exhaustion in the channel and it's having a less of an effect. Appreciate your perspective.","Steve Sanghi","I think first thing I would say is that this is a second quarter in a row where there has been a significant tweak between the time we prepared our guidance and prepared our notes for the time, we delivered our guidance and delivered our notes and quarter-ago, I said the same thing in the conference call that based on that tweet we had to nudge the middle of our guidance down. We had to do exact same thing this time where we had to nudge the middle of our guidance slightly down because of the tweet and the extra tariffs to go into effect on September 1 whether that would happen or not.","I think this is a whole lot of uncertainty. Nobody really knows what would happen what not. In terms of the tariffs that Microchip pays, the effect of this additional $300 million is virtually nothing. There could be small amount of our development tools or something, we're talking thousands of dollars not millions of dollars. So that is not effect. The effect really is how will Chinese customers behave in terms of buying our products to parts which are being exported back to China. Will the customers prefer to buy it from somewhere outside of China. And if they choose a brand outside of China, does that have also other parts of designed in or it\u2019s not. And I think it\u2019s always some in some, in some cases we will gain business because of the outside brand, outside of China has more of products and sometimes we lose because the given brand outside of China has more of the parts from Japan or Europe or somewhere. This is very, very hard to figure out especially when you're dealing with 120,000 plus customers. So hopefully we have navigated this well in the last one year. I think when you write the history of this last one year, I'm not sure how you would conclude that we were not correct.","And hopefully we have navigated it correctly and have guided you correctly and all that wisdom, we have tried to put it in our guidance. That's the best I can say.","Christopher Caso","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of recent consolidation maybe if you want to call it land grab for wireless connectivity assets especially Wi-Fi maybe you guys can just remind us on Microchip\u2019s connectivity portfolio I believe it's pretty comprehensive. I know you guys have Bluetooth, Zigbee, Lora I believe you guys also have Wi-Fi capability but if you could just clarify that and if you can maybe qualitatively sort of quantify the attach rates of your connectivity solutions with your microcontroller platforms and opportunities that do require this type of connectivity capability?","Steve Sanghi","Okay, so you're right. We do have a pretty broad portfolio of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other solutions. So just about all the major requirements that are standards based and even many that are proprietary based wireless solutions, we have in our portfolio. They have come through organic work and they've come through several of the acquisitions that we have done over time. So we don't have a particular glaring issue with a particular wireless requirement that we're not able to meet in the marketplace today.","It doesn't mean we don't have new products, new innovations coming. Those are a normal part of doing the business itself. As far as attach rates go, we don't track as closely what is the attach rate of wireless, we think of systems, our customer systems needing to have smart connected and secure capabilities in them and we provide the building blocks of many different types of smart capabilities with our microcontrollers, processors, analog and other products many different connectivity options not just wireless, wireless and wired and we have a very leading portfolio of Wired analog of wired connectivity solutions as well. And then finally security itself. So that's how we go to market. Looking at how do we enable smart connected and secure solutions but we don't have to have a close tracking of how many of them have connected and off those that are connected how many of those are wireless and if they're wireless, what exactly is the standard that goes behind them.","But we're very happy with the portfolio we have and are able to prosecute the markets and the businesses we want to be able to go after.","Harlan Sur","Yes, great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Matt Ramsey with Cowen.","Joshua Buchalter","Hi this is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results in a tough environment with gross margins hanging in pretty nicely, I was hoping if you could provide an update on the overall pricing environment you've seen through this down cycle. It seems like things have hung in there pretty well all things considered and it would be helpful to hear your view particularly how it compares to prior down cycles? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","So I think when we talk about pricing, I would say that the pricing has held up in this environment better than really it has held up in any business cycle before Microchip pricing in general held up in the prior business cycle also because so many of our products are proprietary but as you talk about this particular business cycle, I would say 95% of what we make today across various different business unit is proprietary where you cannot take our part out and plug somebody else's part in. So therefore we really have never competed for pricing at the buyer's desk.","We often compete with pricing at the designer's desk which is usually two-years ahead of time and the part is going to go to production and whatever quotation you're making at the designer's desk, you have the time to achieve and do cross reduction or achieve the results you need to achieve when the part goes into production. Now especially in this cycle, I think it could be somewhat driven by the consolidation industry has seen, somewhat driven by the players who have been taken out where the weaker player in price management and some of them we ourselves took them out. I think a result of all that is that the pricing has held up or our record all-time high record gross margins, I believe were 62.23% that we made two or three quarters ago and the quarter we just announced that gross margins were 62.2%, that's 23 bps below the record and we're sitting at the bottom of the cycle.","So I think that's good news as the cycle improves and as our factories get further full and as we complete the rest of the Microsemi integration and as we bring more of this stuff from outside to inside, the remaining stuff from Actel and some from Microsemi, it's really interesting to think about where this whole business model goes.","Joshua Buchalter","Very helpful, thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take your question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question and like many others congratulations on the good execution guys. Steve I wanted to follow-up on your remarks regarding an earlier synergies question. You mentioned that that the difficult macro environment has made it tough to realize revenue synergies which is understandable. But the question is this do you still think there is the same degree of revenue synergies that's possible from the combination. Or is there something about what's happened over the last year that would cause you to lower your view of longer-term synergies potential with revenues? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, the opportunity for revenue synergies a theme and some of the earliest piece of revenue synergy where we have gotten our parts around Microsemi sockets and their part around Microchip socket is kind of already beginning to happen but the starting point is lower. The whole industry has lost significant amount from the top line as a starting point.","So even though we may be adding a little bit of the revenue synergy already, the total revenue is still below where we started and that's the more difficult part but the longer-term as the industry recovers from the cycle there is the funnel is very healthy. The indicator we track internally which is the number of Microchip products per customer design, extremely proprietary indicator is continuing to increase and as the baseline business goes up, I think this should be working pretty well. So no we have not lowered the long-term target at all.","Craig Ellis","That's helpful, thank you. And then if I could ask a follow-up to Eric. Eric I recall when the Microsemi transaction was announced that there was an element of the debt burden that was variable rate. Can you confirm how much that is at present and given the decline in interest rates that we've seen especially over the last three to four years. When would that be expected to benefit the interest burden that exists on that debt?","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. Sure. So we have two pieces of variable rate debt in the portfolio. We've got a revolving line of credit and then a term loan B, the revolving line of credit had a balance of $3.197 billion at the end of June and the term loan was $1.724 billion. So roughly $4.9 billion of floating rate debt and we are seeing the Fed cutting interest rates that we are getting a benefit of that today. And that's been reflected in our guidance for the other expense that we've guided to the Street. That is the debt that we are paying down those still, we are paying down the variable rate debt and that come down, we should see the benefit in the overall operating results. Does that address your question?","Craig Ellis","Yes, it does. Thanks guys.","Steve Sanghi","So that variable debt was $1.414 billion higher a year ago. Everything we have paid has been variable so far. So that's what we have paid down in the last year.","Craig Ellis","Got it. Thanks Steve. Thanks Eric.","Operator","And we'll now take your question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Steve, thanks. Let me ask the question. Steve, I think one of the challenges that all the M&A you guys have done over the last several years has been both for the industry analysts and I think internally for you guys is to getting a better understanding of how seasonality is in your business? I'm kind of curious if you can give us some insights when you look at the September guide you just gave a flat-up for how did you peg that against sort of \u201cnormal seasonality\u201d And I guess more importantly as you look into the December quarter, are you guys any closer to helping us understand what normal seasonality might look like in December?","Steve Sanghi","So I think John very, very good question. We always try to figure out the same pain. However seasonality is very hard to measure. Number one with all the acquisitions that keep changing the seasonality because different acquired businesses work differently but also in the current environment with trade tensions and general economic conditions, the variability on the business caused by the U.S., China trade friction and general economic conditions is much larger than any impact of seasonality.","So we can't really compare this to any kind of seasonality. Seasonality is also driven by kind of how somebody was measuring the revenue. Historically, we measure the business based on sell-through revenue recognition and now based on the GAAP standard, we're having to report the numbers based on sell-in and sell-in and sell-through work differently. We have much more cycles learning on a sell-through revenue recognition on seasonality than we have on sell-in. So I think with changing revenue recognition totally different seasonality for Microsemi business with defense and aerospace and FPGA in discrete parts and uncertainty of China, U.S., Brexit and general economic conditions. I think this one remains a very, very good question with no real answer today.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Steve. If I could sneak one in. You did a very good job quantifying the impact of Huawei in the June quarter. I'm just kind of curious and I apologize if I missed this. What's embedded in the September guide. Is it a similar dollar magnitude or would it be more given that that you're taking a view of the entire quarter instead of just half the quarter?","Eric Bjornholt","It's not that easy to answer, it\u2019s not only a function of what is it that we're allowed to ship but what is it that Huawei is able to use. And that is changing day by day as they get inputs from their various suppliers of what they can and cannot ship as well. So what we have built in is less than what a full board would be for a quarter. But it's a conservative estimate that we have put in with our best judgment of what we think Huawei is likely to take. And that changes day to day as we go along.","John Pitzer","Helpful, thanks guys.","Operator","We will now take your question from Christopher Rolland with SIG.","Christopher Rolland","Hey guys, thanks for the question. Any early feedback so far from your silicon carbide products. And then also do you guys have any plans or have you thought about expanding into other compounds semi's out there or perhaps even vertically integrating like guys like wanted to do and then Eric just one for you, the IT security remediation that you guys referenced in non-GAAP expenses, just any details on that? Thanks.","Ganesh Moorthy","So with respect to our silicon carbide products and the customer reaction has been extremely positive. I think that is driven by one, we are a known provider into some of the markets that care most about silicon carbide automotive in particular. But second what differentiates our silicon carbide solutions is the robustness of the product line and that robustness is measured in different ways that we've been able to demonstrate through test results. And in this area where there's very high voltages that are involved in the applications that need silicon carbide robustness is highly valued in what we've done. So the discussions with customers are going well, there's high interest in the product line. It's early days as we are launching and then starting to go into design and activities with them. With respect to any other compounds that we might be looking at. There's really nothing exotic at this point to talk about and we need to really harvest the places where we have investments and make sure they go into production and in time there may be other things we would do but nothing to report on at the moment. Eric?","Eric Bjornholt","Okay. And then on the security matter, I mean we kind of fully disclosed this in our 10-K which was filed in late May that we had a security incident that we are in the process of remediating and it did cause a weakness in our internal controls. So we are working hard on remediating that issue and that that's really what those costs are associated that we are excluding from the non-GAAP results.","Christopher Rolland","Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll now take your question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Steve I had a longer-term question, do you think because of the U.S., China trade conflict there is the possibility of market share shifting onto non-U.S. microcontroller companies, I understand there's obviously nothing near-term but do you think that becomes a risk factor longer term?","Steve Sanghi","That suddenly becomes a risk factor, if Chinese were to think that designing parts from suppliers outside the U.S. is safe for although they have similarly strange relationships with Japan. I'm not sure they like those people either. The other thing is you have to look at the complexity of the products, so commodity products probably would be more subject to risk than many of our advanced products in their datacenter business, communication business, FPGA, 32-bit microcontrollers, networking products, USB, Ethernet, automotive and others where some of the commodity products will be more vulnerable.","So but I think what is happening right now is that we\u2019re seeing a large number of customers starting to move their production outside of China, they\u2019re going to Malaysia, they're going to Thailand, they\u2019re going to Vietnam, they're going wherever some may come to Mexico. So I think we're likely to pick up share in that part of the business that moves outside of China because in the local competition kind of disappears, they largely sell in China and many times passing out a very high quality and they maybe okay for the local Chinese market but naturally okay internationally. So there could be some longer-term impact from that but I think it's largely going to be a wash. Every decade or so another country appears that seems to threaten the world back in the 1980s and Japan was going to take everything and U.S. semiconductor industry was going to die in the 1990s, it was Korea then, then it was Japan, Taiwan and now seems to be China. I think this industry is still pretty innovative and it will survive in the world.","Vivek Arya","If I could sneak in a quick follow-up on gross margins. If I add back the underutilization charges, you're getting close to your longer-term 63% target. Is that the upper limit, is there something in the portfolio that kind of limits you to those kind of gross margins or do you think there is a potential to do better over time? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Well we haven't hit it yet, once we hit it then we'll take a look at it. But yes as I mentioned earlier that the gross margins we have today are I think 600 basis points or so better than in the bottom of the last cycle. So there is a significant accretion usually from the bottom of the cycle to the top of the cycle. So there's a significant opportunity here. Not willing to talk about another target yet but I think your question is a good one.","Vivek Arya","Thanks Steve.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take your question from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.","Hans Mosesmann","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in congrats guys on a tough environment execution there. Hey Ganesh maybe this is one for you. For the FPGA business, how much of that is coming from aerospace, defense and aviation?","Ganesh Moorthy","So we don't break it out by segments but sufficed to say based on whatever data has been provided previously through Microsemi or Actel, it is a significant portion of the business that's where many of the differentiation of the FPGA product line was built around low power around security, around robustness, reliability et cetera which are highly valued there. But it is a pretty significant amount that is also in non-aerospace and defense business and it's growing in those areas quite a bit more as well. So as time goes on, we will retain the strength we have in defense and aerospace but we will also gain in many new areas. As you might see in the most recent announcement we made of a smart and better vision solution using the PolarFire FPGA solution.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay. And then as a follow-up Ganesh, is there on the non-aerospace FPGA business, is there a 5G angles to that business over the next several years?","Ganesh Moorthy","There is and it's being worked on. It's I would call an emerging opportunity for where it's not the same places as some of the high performance players are playing in today but yes as 5G rolls out, there are going to be opportunities and it's on how intelligence is embedded into the edge and less into where it is in the core. And again some of the smart embedded vision solutions that type of opportunity will show up on the 5G side as well. But it's more on the Ed side not in the core network.","Hans Mosesmann","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","We'll go next to Raj Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes, thanks and congrats as well in a precarious environment good results. And forgive me if this question was already answered but I wanted to get a census some of the other players in the space noted the inventory correction in the China automotive market is coming to a completion and that that particular segment which had been affected pretty significantly less than the first two quarters is starting to perhaps recover. Same thing with China Industrial and again if you answered this before forgive me but just wondering if there is any thoughts there in terms of China auto and China Industrial as we go into the second half?","Eric Bjornholt","So I think automotive in China continues to have pretty significant year-over-year declines. I think what we may have seen and maybe the data you saw was in the month of June, there were stronger sales that took place in part that was driven because there was emissions change that was happening on July 1 and cars that were sold before the end of June qualified under the old requirements and then the new requirements went into being. So I don't believe that fundamentally the China automotive market has strengthened in any recent timeframe. It will obviously has more probability to bottom and go up given how far it's come down but I wouldn't say there's anything in the short term that has shown up in China automotive.","Steve Sanghi","Let me add to it, Raj you begin with talking about inventory correction in the China automotive. I don't know if that is the case. I don\u2019t think we have seen an inventory issue in China automotive that inventory needed to be blown out. We have seen a reduction in demand driven by just duties and problems in China economy therefore lot of the luxury car manufacturers are building much, much less. So we have seen demand disruption. I don't really think there was at least from a Microchip standpoint, there was not a high inventory in China automotive.","Rajvindra Gill","Go ahead.","Steve Sanghi","With respect to your question on industrial, I think industrial weakness is not limited to just China alone. I think industrial in Europe, in the Americas, in China across the board has seen weakness. I think you've seen that in some of our competitors releases as well. Some of it has been initiated from the trade and tariffs and impact from about a year ago. But industrial remains a weak segment.","Rajvindra Gill","And this is my follow-up also a question on the silicon carbide offering. So my understanding is if you're targeting 700 volt, 1200 volt diodes and MOSFETs, I\u2019m wondering how we think you should think about the revenue opportunity for SIC. I believe you've got the technology you heard it from Microsemi. Just wanted to get some details on kind of the history of that and how we think about the revenue stream?","Steve Sanghi","So yes the technology did come from Microsemi, it was being incubated inside Microsemi. I think what Microchip has been able to do is use our automotive strength where we have substantial market position with automotive Tier 1s and OEMs to liberate what was a technology that was starting to come into fruition inside Microsemi but didn't have as much customer access and that's what we have done over the last year, it has been able to take that technology showcase it, demonstrate it and also internally work on what does it take to be automotive ready, what does it take to be qualified for automotive and dock workers for what we could bring to the Microsemi businesses that we're working on silicon carbide.","I think from a revenue standpoint this is in a market where predominantly automotive has a large demand requirements that we believe will show up in time, it is an area that requires time to win designs, ramp into production, so it's not near-term revenue but it's sowing the seeds for mid to long-term revenue.","Rajvindra Gill","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A question on the direct business. Appreciate all the commentary about what Microchip has seen through distribution, I know it\u2019s an important channel for you but hoping to better understand what you may be seeing with your direct business in terms of orders and I realize it's harder to gauge inventory levels at your direct customers but any anecdotal commentary you can provide us about how inventory may be at those direct customers? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","I would say our direct business by channel is by geography is really no different than our distribution business by geography. Europe was weak and China saw recovery from the Chinese New Year and America was somewhere in the middle. So I don't think the customers will buy from distribution have behaved any differently than the customers who buy from us direct.","Mark Delaney","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will now take your question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. It\u2019s actually similar to the last question but some companies, some semiconductor companies have specifically called out the possibility that there were customers in particular in China that may have been pulling forward demand in the fear that either well some trade friction either a tariff or a ban would influence their business going forward. Are you seeing this to any degree in your customer base, do you believe that you're able to see it or any sort of comments or update in that regard would help. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","So one thing you have to remember is that Microchip does business with a long tail of the customer, average customer is relatively small. And when they're small, they usually underfunded with very not as healthy balance sheet. So we have not really seen this pulling phenomena as much as we read and listen to other people's commentary. If you saw little bit from the larger customers, it was kind of last year. I think that has kind of run its course. Every two, three months the rules are changing. You have an equal amount of risk by bringing lot of buying it ahead and then have tariffs shortly go away. There is a settlement then you get stuck with a large amount of inventory that you have paid lower amount of tariff on that you can get it back from your customers.","Let me say that one more time to explain. Let's say tariff on a given amount of product is supposed to go from 10% to 25%. To avoid that to bring in a lot of inventory at 10% tariff and then it results into a settlement with a tariff go to zero. Now the large amount of inventory you brought at a 10% tariff, you cannot recover those 10% tariff. None of your customers will pay for it because the current rules of tariffs are zero. So this is an equal risk reward game. And some people may have done push pull but I don't think it has affected our revenue at all.","William Stein","That's helpful. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Yes, hey thanks for taking my follow-up. Content game for opportunity is the strong driver of the business. Obviously, it's a part of the Microchip 2.0 strategy, last year you guys updated as you were driving about 20% year-over-year increase in number of Microchip products per customer program. You've got a plethora of analog interface, connectivity solutions alongside MCU, FPGAs. Are you guys still driving that type of content growth on new opportunities?","Steve Sanghi","We are, I mean I think the last time we measured was about a quarter or so ago leading up to some of the conferences we go in September, we will try to add another data point on it. I don't have the number right now but I think with all we see through the reviews, our total system solution trust with more and more of Microsemi businesses integrated with Microchips that only get stronger not weaker. So I think yes, we will be seeing that kind of content growth. But remember the base water level has gone down.","So when the base water level has gone down on Microsemi business as well as Microchip business because of those uncertainty, the goodness you're getting through total system solutions is not showing up. It's very hard to measure because that should be accelerating our growth. And so far it is not because we're fighting the downturn. But the indicator looks very healthy when we look at it.","Harlan Sur","Yes, thanks for the insights.","Steve Sanghi","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Thank you very much for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to reconcile what I thought were two comments that were in conflict a bit, so Ganesh I thought I heard you note that with respect to Microsemi synergies there were still some business systems and operational synergies benefits to be realized and that those would have economic benefit. And then Eric you noted that OpEx would be up $10 million quarter-on-quarter. So I would have expected that the synergies would offset incremental expenses.","So is there just a timing issue there and then just further clarifying the OpEx point, you made Eric if OpEx is up in the quarter. Are we seeing the full benefit of whatever initiatives the management team is executing in the quarters or some follow-on effect to a subsequent quarter? Thanks guys.","Ganesh Moorthy","Craig, it is correct that we have continuing synergies coming from operations and business systems that are being combined into the Microchip systems or bringing them down from the number that were there. If you remember we started with 22 systems, 21 from what we inherited from Microsemi, one from Microchip, we're about a little more than a third of the way through bringing that down, we still have a fair number to go through in the next four quarters.","And that takes time because it's not a quarter-to-quarter, you're going to get instantaneously all of that benefit that comes out, there are support costs that go into these things, there are system costs that go into these things. So on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I would not draw a conclusion that when expenses as a percentage are flat that somehow we have no longer got any more synergies coming, they will come, they will take time, they could be more in a certain quarter, it could be less in a certain quarter. Do you want to add to that, Eric?","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, I think that's absolutely right. So we\u2019re essentially driving OpEx to be flat and percentage of sales in the current quarter and I talked a little bit in my first response to the question that we drove OpEx down very, very significantly over the last four quarters and we do have some investments that are needed to be made in the business and we're making those, we consider those modest but absolutely believe as we get some consistent revenue growth behind us that the OpEx as a percentage of sales are going to go down as we work towards our long-term target of 22.5%.","And we will get some dollar savings as Ganesh was referring to as we continue to go through these business integrations over the course of the next year.","Steve Sanghi","I would add that if, yes this is Steve. If we hadn't beaten the OpEx in the last four quarters, you wouldn't see this as much of an increase but we got the OpEx synergies very aggressively early on, that has established lower mark and some of the investments we delayed and now we're having to make those investments, a number of very advanced technology tape-outs in the coming quarters. And that those tape-outs are very expensive and I think that's leading to some of the increase quarter-over-quarter. But I think the main issue is that we got the OpEx synergy much faster and not having to make some investments.","Eric Bjornholt","And it's actually about a $6 million increase quarter-on-quarter not $10 million.","Craig Ellis","Appreciate the color guys. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","Yes, hey guys. I'm surprised nobody asked this but in the September quarter Eric and Steve and Ganesh as you guys look out. Sounds like from your commentary correct me if I'm wrong FPGAs are doing really well. So I would expect that to grow better than the midpoint of 2%. But any thoughts on Microcontroller on the analog business that one will outperform the other or just kind of think about 2% kind of a growth rate on average for those?","Eric Bjornholt","We don't breakout by product line segments on our forward-looking guidance. So I would just look at the forward-looking guidance to 2% midpoint as for the company overall.","Steve Sanghi","I mean I think you trying to divide 2% breaking that really is tough.","Harsh Kumar","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","And it appears, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. Thank you very much everybody attending this call. I think I like to reemphasize that we've been providing good guidance and managing this business through very turbulent times. We in fact started talking about these tariffs and all that before anybody else. Last year and I think our guidance has been kind of right on.","We guided March quarter to be the bottom and I think we have largely delivered that without the Huawei ban we would have delivered that both on end-market demand as well as sell-in. Current quarter we're guiding up a little bit 2% up on the midpoint and we'll go from there. We'll see you at some of the conferences coming up in early September.","Eric Bjornholt","Maybe even before that. So next week we\u2019ll be at the KeyBanc Conference, we\u2019re at Jefferies Conference, we\u2019re at the Citi Conference in September and in Raymond James conference. So four conferences and a couple of other investor outings this quarter.","Steve Sanghi","So heavy schedule, so we\u2019ll see you some of you in the road. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, who is joining us from business travel in New York today; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, who is joining us from business travel in India today; and Gordon Parnell Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales on the September quarter were a record $407.8 million, including $72.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from SMSC, and were up sequentially 15.7% from net sales of $352.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $24.5 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue by product line was $261.3 million for microcontrollers, $86.6 million for analog, $36.6 million for memory, $20.1 million for licensing and $3.2 million of other.","Revenue by geography was $81.8 million in the Americas, $85.6 million in Europe and $240.4 million in Asia.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.7% in the September quarter and non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 29.2% of sales, and net income was $97.7 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, $0.038 of which related to SMSC's operating results.","On a full GAAP basis, net sales were a record $383.3 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 50.7% in the September quarter.","GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by the sell-through of $22.7 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisitions.","Total operating expenses were $186.1 million or 48.6% of sales and include share-based compensation of $17.9 million, acquisition-related expenses of $40.6 million and a special charge of $11.5 million related to legal matters that were settled associated with Silicon Storage Technology that we acquired in April 2010.","The GAAP net loss was $21.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share and was impacted by $29.7 million of nonrecurring tax charges associated with our acquisition of SMSC.","In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, and the GAAP tax expense was impacted by the onetime charge I mentioned above. The non-GAAP tax expense in the September quarter was negatively impacted by $2.4 million of SMSC tax matters and will continue in future quarters -- or tax that will not continue in future quarters, excuse me.","Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Once SMSC is fully integrated into our business systems and operating structure, we expect our forward-looking effective tax rate to be about 13% to 15%. And I'll remind you that this is without any benefit from the R&D tax credit, which has currently expired and has not yet been reinstated.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.083, acquisition-related items were about $0.323, the special charge related to the legal settlements was about $0.021, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and the onetime tax charge was about $0.145.","The dividend declared today of $0.352 per share will be paid on December 6, 2012 to shareholders of record on November 21, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $68.5 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 41st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and this program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2012 was $289.5 million or 140 days, up 3 days from the prior quarter levels. The inventory balance at September 30, 2012 includes $26.2 million of SMSC inventory write-up costs required for purchase accounting. Inventory at our distributors continue be at historically low levels at 31 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At September 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance was $230.5 million. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.71 billion, and we had $600 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $80 million to $100 million in the December quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $15.9 million for the September quarter, including SMSC capital spending. We expect about $15 million in capital spending this quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013 to be about $50 million.","Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $22.3 million, also including SMSC.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines, and let's start with microcontrollers.","Our stand-alone microcontroller revenue, without SMSC, was $227.4 million in the September quarter, down 5.5% sequentially, but slightly positive as compared to the year-ago quarter. As we explained in our last conference call, Microchip classified SMSC revenue into microcontrollers and analog products. Based on the partial quarter, from August 2 to September 30, SMSC's total non-GAAP revenue was $72.5 million. 46.8% of this revenue or roughly $33.9 million was microcontroller revenue, and 53.2% or roughly $38.5 million was analog revenue.","For the rest of my prepared remarks, I shall be using non-GAAP revenue in all of my commentary. Combining the $33.9 million of microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical microcontroller revenue, Microchip's total microcontroller revenue for the quarter was $261.3 million, an all-time record.","Our standalone 16-bit microcontroller business was down 7.8% sequentially and up 28.8% from the year-ago quarter. Coming on the heels of several strong growth quarters and the achievement of record revenue in the June quarter, the softness seen in the September quarter is reflective of the weak macro environment. Combining the 16-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical 16-bit microcontroller revenue, this business achievement an all-time record for revenue in the September quarter.","Our stand-alone 32-bit microcontroller business was down 0.5% sequentially after being up a whopping 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter, which was a record. This business was also up 97% from the year-ago quarter, demonstrating continuing strong share gains. Combining the 32-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical 32-bit microcontroller revenue, this business also achieved an all-time record for revenue in the September quarter.","Moving to development tools. We shipped almost 47,000 tools in the September quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped close to 1.39 million development tools, and development tools sales remained an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design-in activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers.","Now let's move to our analog business. Microchip's stand-alone analog business, without SMSC, bucked the trend and grew 1.9% sequentially to achieve a new record and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. Our analog business was also up 13.7% as compared to the year-ago quarter.","The innovative new products we've been introducing for a while now are fueling the above-average growth of our analog business, and we have more new innovative products in our development pipeline that will be coming soon. As an example, next week, we will be launching 2 new products -- 2 new families of analog products. The first is a portfolio of high-efficiency discrete power MOSFETs, specifically tuned for power applications. The second is a family of analog power controllers that offer higher voltages and deliver excellent power conversion efficiencies. Both product families expand our served available markets for existing customers and applications, as well as enable us to penetrate new customers and applications and nicely complement our dsPIC digital signal controllers, which already have a leadership position in the power conversion market segment.","Combining the analog revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical analog revenue, our analog business in the September quarter represented 21.2% of Microchip's business, almost 3x the proportion of Microchip's business that analog was just a few years ago.","Moving now to the memory products. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 10.2% on a sequential basis. While this business has had some drag on our growth as we avoid chasing the profitless posterity of growth with no profit, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 9% of our combined revenue in the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customer to complete their solutions.","Before I wrap up, a quick update on how the SMSC integration is progressing. The effort to combine the operational and business systems of both companies is always a massive post-closing effort. As a follow-up to the plan we outlined at our August conference call, I'm happy to report that all SMSC products are on track to ship from Microchip's operational system no later than January 1, 2013, and all business systems are on track to converge by the first calendar quarter of 2013.","We have also identified several areas of operational synergies that can exploit our assembly and test infrastructure in Thailand. We've also gone through our combined supply chains and identified a number of opportunities where we can harness the best cost that either company has, as well as the opportunity to leverage our combined volume for lower cost. These opportunities are being actively worked to realize the savings that they represent.","The SMSC business divisions are also well into the integration process. We have already identified a number of synergy opportunities in the area of IP acquisition and development, CAD infrastructure, reference design, joint marketing and joint development. In the coming months, we expect to find many more synergy opportunities.","On the sales front, we continue to maintain a separate focus on the different product lines to ensure customer focus and continuity. In the meanwhile, the sales teams are working together to cross-train and enable more cross-selling opportunities as time goes on.","We have also combined the distribution networks of both companies and, in the process, franchised Arrow, who only had SMSC products, to also sell Microchip products, as well as franchised Future Electronics, who only had Microchip products, to also sell SMSC products. With these changes, all 3 global distributors, Avnet, Arrow and Future Electronics, are franchised for our complete product line on a global basis. This now makes Microchip the only supplier of microcontrollers and analog that has franchised the 3 largest global distributors on a worldwide basis. We're also well into the process of franchising our 80-plus regional distributors in Europe and Asia on the SMSC product lines, which will further add to the sales reach for these products.","Last but not least, we have expended considerable time and energy in many Microchip managers to guide SMSC employees in matters related to our unique culture and guiding values and to be personally visible during the integration process at the different SMSC locations, so that everyone understands the goal and is pulling in one direction.","We are thankful to the extra effort invested by many Microchip employees to execute and support the integration and proud of the SMSC employees who are embracing our culture and unleashing their full potential towards the business of the combined companies.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2013.","Our September quarter results were slightly lower than what we had guided during the last earnings call and consistent with the preliminary results we announced on October 15. The shortfall was entirely attributable to the macro environment, which was very weak. The negative effects of Europe and weaker economic activity in the U.S. and China led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the range of guidance for net sales and earnings per share.","Our consolidated results, including SMSC, had several major highlights. First, our microcontroller business achieved an all-time record at $261.3 million revenue. Our analog business also reached a new record at $86.6 million revenue. Our analog business now represents 21.2% of our total sales. Our total business made a new record at $407.8 million revenue and, for the first time, caused a $1.6 billion run rate.","Last but not the least, on a non-GAAP basis, the September quarter was our 88th consecutive quarter of profitability.","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2013. We are continuing to see very weak macroeconomic environment in the U.S., Europe, Asia and China. We believe that the world of GDP growth is decelerating. We are seeing weakness in SMSC business, as well as Microchip's microcontroller, analog and memory businesses. However, the December quarter will have 3 months of SMSC business versus 2 months last quarter, which is expected to take our net sales to a new record high at the midpoint of our guidance.","We expect Microchip's total net sales, including SMSC, to be $396 million to $426 million. This includes approximately $87 million to $94 million of SMSC net sales.","Given the continuing weak macroeconomic environment, we are no longer comfortable with the high inventory level we have in our business. Therefore, we have decided to cut the wafer starts in our fab. We are putting the fab personnel on a rotating time-off schedule. This was the same technique that we deployed in early 2009, and it worked very well at that time. It reduces factory output, but, at the same time, keeps the staff employed for reduced work hours and gives us the flexibility to ramp rapidly should the need arise. This will have a negative impact of about 200 basis points on the gross margin from the September quarter. We expect to be on this rotating time-off through the end of June 2013. We expect the inventory to be corrected by then and, with some recovery in the business, we expect to start normalizing the production wafer starts and the employee work hours.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our consolidated gross margins to be between 55.5% to 56% of sales; we expect operating expenses to be between 30.5% to 31% of sales; and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 24.5% to 25.5 percentage of sales; and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.37 to $0.41 per share. This EPS includes about $0.04 to $0.05 accretion from the acquisition of SMSC.","In the August conference call, we had guided December quarter accretion from SMSC to be $0.06 to $0.07. The difference is all related to the business downturn and lower sales projection toward the December quarter. For the March 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion from SMSC to increase to about $0.05 to $0.06 per share, and for the June 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion to be $0.06 to $0.07 per share. For fiscal year '14, we expect to be in the full range of accretion of about $0.08 to $0.09 per share per quarter by the end of fiscal year. These numbers remain subject to the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy, in general.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisition, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","As you very well know, Microchip has maintained the premium financial model for gross margin, operating expenses and operating profit for a very long time. Every time we do an acquisition where the target's operating business model is not at par with Microchip, there is substantial speculation regarding what the acquisition will do to Microchip's combined business model.","Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisition, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. In the case of SMSC, we are implementing substantial business process improvements to improve gross margin percentage, lower operating expenses and substantially increase its operating profit.","Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus\/minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus\/minus 0.5%; and operating profit of 32.5%, plus\/minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just to start, if you can comment a little bit about what you're seeing with the macro conditions. I think what you guys are talking about is not too far different than what we're seeing from others. I guess, to what extent is this -- your customers taking down inventory levels further? To what extent is it just demand hitting a new lower level, in your opinion?","Steve Sanghi","The distributors have taken down inventory and, as Eric pointed out, the distribution inventory is a decade low. As far as the customers are concerned, there is -- there's really a demand shortage. Any time the demand falls, then any inventory customers have becomes more based on their run rate. So there is always an element of inventory correction to that lower demand number. But the predominant issue is really the macro weakness where we have record number of design wins, lots and lots of new customers going to production. If you look at total number of designs we're shipping into any given customer is increasing, but they're all taking less dollar amount and less unit amount per design, which is not a whole different commentary than we have seen with many other competitors. That's sort of what we are seeing.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, and I think you commented on this last quarter with respect to what the seasonality of the business looks like as we incorporate SMSC, but wondering if you could talk about that again, given you have a little more time under your belt and maybe a little better feeling for the SMSC business in terms of seasonality.","Steve Sanghi","Well, we don't really have that much more to comment. The thing is we have changed the SMSC's calendar to a Microchip fiscal calendar. Their quarters ended on May and August and November. So if you look at a quarter like December and then March, in their February ending quarter, they would pick up December, which will usually be weak, and then pick up the Chinese New Year. And on Microchip calendar, Thanksgiving and December fall in one quarter and the Chinese New Year falls in another quarter. So there are a lot of moving parts. In parallel with all that, with commentary you're seeing from all the PC guys and others, there's a substantial demand contraction in the business, along with the inventory correction. So with so many moving parts, I don't think we're ready to establish a new seasonality. I think I would actually say that there is no pattern of seasonality anymore in the business. It's just whatever happens. If you look at a lot of different companies and you simply try to predict a quarter based on its seasonality for the last 5 years, you don't get a good meaningful result. We will have a better feeling about a year after we have run SMSC on our clock, and some of our seasonality might change. But even if you look at our own business, we hardly ever have weak September. September usually is a fairly strong quarter for us, and we have just experienced a very weak September. So I think the old seasonality models are really out the window.","Operator","We'll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak + Co.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","If I look at the $24 million, the difference between GAAP, non-GAAP revenue in the September quarter, is there any way you can just give us a rough breakdown of what that is between the MCU and analog?","Steve Sanghi","Eric, I don't know if you have broken that out.","James Eric Bjornholt","I don't think that's something that we're ready to share here in terms of breakdown of analog and microcontroller. But the issue there, Brendan, it's just any inventory that's sitting in the distribution channel on the date of the acquisition, we don't get to recognize the sell-through for that. So that's something that we can follow up on, but I don't have a number for you in terms of the micro-analog split unless Gordon has something he'd want to share.","Gordon W. Parnell","No, I don't have that available.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, I'll follow up with you guys after the call. The -- I mean, I guess, looking at the utilization inventory correction part of the thing that you're talking about through the June quarter, and typically, Steve has a good kind of take on the overall semiconductor cycle, are we looking at basically things being pretty tough going here through the June quarter? Or when -- what do you think -- are we going to bottom in the March quarter? Or what's your take on it? You generally have some sort of outlook on that.","Steve Sanghi","Well, let me take a crack at it. Basically, I think, along with you guys, us and everybody else is concerned about the fiscal cliff. It's having negative impact on the business now, and it will continue to have the business into probably the first quarter. Nobody knows whether fiscal cliff is going to get resolved. If it does get resolved, then it takes a while for it to get into the system. Meanwhile, lots of -- lots and lots of our small customers are strapped with credit and living hand to mouth and not launching their products and taking lower revenue and seeing economic contraction, and all those things are continuing. There is a big power change going on in China with the new President and the new Premier coming in. Nobody knows the impact of that. Usually, most people say that, that will have a positive effect, but, again, it takes some time for it to incur. So there are a lot of cross currents. When I mentioned through the June of next year, it's just cutting wafer starts for about a 7.5-month period, which we think will correct the inventory to a point where I will feel comfortable. A growth in the business between now and then will actually accelerate it, bring the inventory down and the action manned [ph] earlier. So it's more driven by the wafer starts, how long we need to correct the inventory than is a commentary on whether I expect the business to be not good through June.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could have just a very quick follow-up on that on the gross margin side because you're cutting wafer starts. You're going to keep these wafer starts low for 7 months, so we could expect these gross margins to stay at current low levels or the same period or hit bottom in the December quarter and tick up a little bit?","Steve Sanghi","No, I think they will stay at that level, and it will modulate based on -- if we see any revenue growth or strength in business or distributors start building inventory and then if we modulate these wafer start cuts, we're cutting at a certain level. If we cut less, then the margin will improve. So if we don't cut, then -- if we cut and keep it at the same level, then the margin will stay in this range through the June.","Operator","We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the end market behavior you're seeing going into Q4. I mean, clearly, things are weaker across the board, but any notable pockets of weakness outside of PCs or any pockets that you think did relatively better?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, do you have any comment to make on that?","Ganesh Moorthy","Clearly, the markets that are in -- related to PC, consumer electronics, as they go through the December quarter, are the ones that tend to have a market change that is associated with the December quarter. So those are the markets, I would say, that are performing or behaving like they are. Some of the other ones which are the industrial markets, et cetera, are not quite as pronounced as that. So there are small changes, but at the end, most of our business tends to have -- it's a large base of customers. We have new customers, new applications that are also in the mix, and we don't see as much of a company-wide effect that you can decode down to end markets in any given quarter.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up on the earlier question on the factory loadings, I just want to clarify. It sounds like you're saying that if business conditions don't get any worse, you want to keep these loadings at this level until roughly the June quarter, and that should be enough to bring the inventories down. Is that correct? And any other thoughts around what would prompt you to bring the factory loadings up earlier than that point?","Steve Sanghi","Well, there are always a large number of moving parts. So business conditions don't improve, but distribution thinks the inventory has gone too low. 31 days is really extremely low, a decade low. And if the distribution builds back some of the inventory, getting prepared for the any upturn or improvement in business condition, then that would be a positive. There's a large amount of mix across memory, analog, microcontroller products, and you can always have the mix change, which could drive that you have to build certain number of products. And some different products will take a little longer to bleed out. So there are a lot of moving parts, but I think that's the general thing.","Operator","We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the first question is in regard to the Japanese market. Obviously, a lot of the Japanese analog and microcontroller suppliers are having difficulty, given the tough times internally in the Japanese market and given currency. I want to just to understand how competitively you've seen their behavior change given some of the distress that they're facing.","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","It's not something that has just happened. For a while now, the larger semiconductor companies in Japan have been trying to figure out how to restructure. Some have been at restructuring now for 7, 8 years and really have made progress very, very slowly. But as they go through their troubles, we find more opportunities where customers are uncomfortable with their supply. Whoever they have in their supply base are increasingly inviting us to be part of that base, and I don't think it is a very quick transition. But I think, over the long run, there are more opportunities for Microchip, both in Japan, but also outside of Japan, where these same companies sell their products, where Microchip should be able to find more homes and more served markets that we can go after.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up question, this one regarding SMSC and the computing market; as we look to the transition toward Haswell in mid-'13, what do you see in terms of opportunities, perhaps, for you in that business?","Steve Sanghi","So SMSC is very well-positioned for the Haswell architecture because Intel has chosen SMSC as the partner for providing the embedded controller for Haswell. One\u00a0of the main thing Haswell architecture brings is a term called standby connectivity. Today, you lose the conductivity when you close your PC, and the Haswell architecture will provide very low power, significant savings in power. And you could have it on a standby and still you're connected, getting e-mails, getting stuff, things downloaded and all that stuff. So it requires very, very low power, and we're the partner. So I think the content goes up when Haswell is in volume production. Does that answer your question?","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It did.","Operator","We'll go next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Just had a question about the guidance, and I may have missed this. But did you break down for us the non-GAAP versus GAAP revenue guidance? And if not, could you please or could you give us some sense of how much is left in distribution that you will not be able to put in your revenues over time?","James Eric Bjornholt","Steve, I'll take that. So JoAnne, there's no difference in GAAP and non-GAAP revenue in the December quarter. So all the inventory that was in the SMSC distribution channel essentially flushed through during the September quarter. So that we do have in our guidance table on the press release GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, and on revenue line, they're the same.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, all right. I appreciate the reminder. Okay. And then just on the pace of orders. We've been hearing different patterns on the Microchip side or microcontroller side of analog. Could you give us some detail about what you've seen so far early here in the December quarter for the order pattern on both those sides of your businesses?","Steve Sanghi","The order patterns in the business continue to be weak, consistent with what we have guided, and I don't believe there is any noticeable difference on analog versus microcontrollers.","Operator","We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on December gross margins, Eric. Is there -- is it all rotating time off that's affecting the gross margin number as such? Or are there other things that are built in? Will you just clarify for us?","Steve Sanghi","So, Eric, let me comment, then you can add to it. So I think there are 2 factors. The biggest impact is coming out of cutting wafer starts. The rotating time off is just one way of managing the wafer start cut. The gross margin decline is not coming out of rotating time off. It's coming out of lower utilization by cutting the wafer start. Some people lay off the people to really then manage reduced activity. Instead of laying off, we give everybody a shared sacrifice cut so you have the people employed, trained, working on new processes, ready to increase their hours when we need it. So very quickly increase the activity when we need it. So just a clarification that the gross margin impact is coming out of starts cut, not the rotating time off. Rotating time off is just one way of managing reduced hours -- work hours. But there's also a second impact on gross margin, which is coming out of SMSC revenue being 3 months now versus 2 months last quarter. Please add something if you need to add.","James Eric Bjornholt","No covered it, Steve. That's good.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And as a follow-up, if I can ask, guys, is most of the OpEx cuts at SMSC that were supposed to happen, are you guys done with most of that? Or is some of it still left? Just any kind of update you want to give us?","Steve Sanghi","So it's not all done. As Ganesh pointed out, the -- all the products are supposed to ship from Microchip's IT and business systems by January\u00a01. So it's really not all completed yet. The lowest-hanging fruit early on has been done, but there's some more hard work ahead.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]\u00a0We'll go next to Steven Eliscu with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The first question regarding the new added distributors for parts of your business with Arrow and Future. With the additional-- when you added Memec and focused that effort on generating additional design win growth, clearly, you learned something in terms of how that benefited your business. And given the material addition in terms of just the apps people on the street, how do you -- do you expect a material increase with this edition in terms of demand creation and future growth?","Steve Sanghi","Well, yes, we see a meaningful difference in the number of design wins and the registrations and all that created. But it's a very design win-driven business, and the incubation period for design wins is 9 months on the earliest to up to 2 years. So you could get a little bit of revenue here and there from jumper balls, but -- and some on the analog products and some on the commodity memory products. But real design win revenue is a little out in time because there's incubation periods.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up to that. You're saying that there will be a delayed effect, but based on what you learned from the demand creation from Memec, you do expect some material increase in demand creation from adding Arrow and Future to the respective parts of the business.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, I do. But, Eric, roughly, what portion of our business are global distributors?","James Eric Bjornholt","Steve, it's probably -- we'd have to look at a full run rate for SMSC, but it's definitely less than 20% of the overall business. It's probably closer to 15%.","Steve Sanghi","Yes. So as we have described many, many times before, we have 80-plus regional distributors, which are strong demand creators in the largest geography we have in Asia and also lots of them in Europe. Global distributors are good contributors, but all of them combined are in that range. So it's a positive thing to really add and extend the channel. It's a very positive thing for SMSC to have Microchip's largest distributor, which is Future Electronics, to be engaged in selling and creating designs for SMSC products also. So I'm not taking it away, but I'm just -- I don't know what your model will say in tempering the enthusiasm.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. No, I understood. That's very helpful. And just a different question on your experience with SMSC; based on what you just said. It sounds like you're finding lots of opportunities for cost synergies as you really get into business. I guess, what I'm curious about is just with SMSC being on the other side of the country, how that -- how you've been able to deal with that. If that has ended up making the logistics more difficult than maybe you expected. And if you would be more cautious about future acquisitions, that were so far away from your home base.","Steve Sanghi","No, I mean I'm stuck in New York in 32 degrees. I'd rather be in Phoenix at 88. So with that said, we have broad management team. Myself and Ganesh and Gordon and others have been taking turns, and it's really tag teaming. SMSC was absolutely with a great analysis on it. We understood it well. We're executing it very well. We haven't found any major problems that we had not anticipated. The entire integration is going very well. It will turn out to be absolutely the right thing to do and very, very good acquisition. We probably would have beaten our numbers for accretion and all that and how well after being added for a while with the products and all that we see. Unfortunately, we had not counted on the strong downturn in the business environment 2 months after acquiring the company that you have seen from every other semiconductor company; it's not an SMSC-specific problem. If this environment had waited another 9 months, had given us through June or September of next year, we would have produced outstanding results. Just you would have been proud of them. And we still will. But now it will take longer because short term, all the improvements we are making on gross margin and OpEx cut and business model improvements, finding the synergy, are all being overshadowed by the business environment and the drop in the revenue because you can't get your way out of it. So that's why we have lowered the December accretion from $0.06 to $0.07 we had to now a number, I don't want to be wrong on it, Gordon. Is it $0.05 to $0.06 or $0.04 to $0.05?","Gordon W. Parnell","$0.05.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, $0.04 to $0.05 now versus what we had guided before. And to what we had guided before, we had upside. So that is the unfortunate thing, which is nothing to do with SMSC, it just has to do with the environment. But beyond that, New York is not the only place they are in. They have a large center in Austin. They have people in Irvine. They have people in San Jose. There's a center in Germany. And Microchip has people in all those places also. So management team is spread out. That's what we have to be able to do. It's a global company. Ganesh, actually, is attending this call from India in Bangalore where Microchip has 200 people and SMSC has about 80 people who are moving into our facility at the end of December. And I'm here in New York. I was yesterday at the SMSC headquarters. So no, that will not change our desire to do these global acquisitions in the future. There is absolutely no issue related to that. It's working very well. It's the environment that has taken some wind out.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I echo the earlier sentiment on the clear transparency in terms of how SMSC impacted your business. The first question is a follow-up to the prior discussion, Steve. As you look at the SMSC business, as it's coming in, it looks like the accretion targets are about $0.02 lower in the December through the June quarters versus prior, and you've been clear that that's a revenue impact. But is there -- is the revenue impact that you're seeing there in any one particular part of the SMSC business or parts of that business? Or is it just equally broad-based across all their businesses?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I don't know if it's equal. Nothing ever happens equally in our business also. But it's broadly distributed. There are 4 divisions we are running in SMSC: One is the automotive; other is the computing; third is the USB and Ethernet; and fourth is the wireless audio. And there is downturn in all those 4 businesses, not dissimilar to Microchip where we are seeing downturn in our analog, microcontroller, memory, all businesses.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-up, it looks like the new capital expenditure expectation for this fiscal year is about $10 million lower than what you communicated 3 months ago. Can you help us understand where it is that you're able to be a little bit more efficient with your capital spend?","Steve Sanghi","Basically, when the business is not growing, you usually have enough capital. So the capacity capital incrementally really goes to 0, and then you have here and there bottlenecks, new technology or some new things that you have to invest in. But driven by the lower revenue guidance, you're able to take some capital out. The reduction actually is more than $10 million because the older number was Microchip alone. This is now includes SMSC, and they had a capital budget.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you say how much you're planning to spend for the SMSC and the Microchip parts of the businesses this year?","Steve Sanghi","We really have not broken it out. And as the synergies identified, if there is some capital needed to transfer something to Microchip factories at a lower cost, I am more than willing to spend that money, if the cost is lower, but otherwise, also if the capital has been constrained. So these are being identified as we go. There's not a lot of it between now and end of the quarter because a lot of those programs are being identified and all that, and capital takes a little while to buy and make it productive.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is there a time for a question to Eric?","James Eric Bjornholt","Sure.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","The companies effectively go into a shared sacrifice program in manufacturing to get output to the right level to rebalance inventory. As you look at the weak environment that we're in, Microchip has historically been very strong at operating expense management. How do you think about operating expense levels given the uncertain backdrop and what sounds like uncertainty on the part of the management team over the next 2 to 3 quarters? Is there an opportunity to take OpEx lower? And if so, what could be the triggers to do that?","James Eric Bjornholt","Well, Craig, I mean, we've got a variable compensation system at Microchip and we've used that historically to manage through these difficult times. So with that, we look at those things. We have worldwide communication meetings where we talk about spending and how to act like this money is your own and employees latch on to that. So we get the whole employee population involved in the process. And just as in prior downturns, we will do an excellent job of managing expenses this go around.","Steve Sanghi","We want you to know that starting Monday, my management team already knows that our management team, our weekly director, corporate fellows, they're all on a 5% pay cut starting Monday. So Microchip leadership team steps up first to make the sacrifice when we're asking anybody else to do anything. Earnings are down substantially. Operating expenses have popped up, driven by lower revenues, so the entire management team. And it's been a voluntary program, and pretty much, everybody will step up.","Operator","We'll go next to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, I apologize if I missed this, but did you throw out kind of either on an absolute dollar basis or days basis kind of what target inventory levels you're looking to get to by June? And if by the off chance, end demand surprise on the upside, can you just remind me cycle time through the fab and how quickly the fab network could respond?","Steve Sanghi","Well, no, I didn't throw out any number. I never want to be limited to pin down to any number. It's a complex business where it depends on how much inventory's in distribution. If inventory in distribution goes to 40, then I'm comfortable with one set of number. If it's 31, I'm comfortable with another set of number. So no, I have not thrown any number out. What I think historically we have talked about, if the distribution inventory was average, which clearly it is not, if it was average, then we are comfortable in the 115 to 120 range. Obviously, I have not reevaluated it with SMSC in there. And the reason we haven't reevaluated is the inventory calculation is really messed up right now with this purchase accounting. So when you add $26 million or so, write up the inventory to a full price, sale value, which the GAAP accounting requires, it's really messed up. So we've got to flush out in the next few months and really be able to have a more meaningful indicator that you can latch onto, then analyze the business and look at what the longer-term inventory would be. So I'll give you guys a number in the future, but for Microchip alone, that number in the past was 115 to 120. And with SMSC, it will change.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Steve, just cycle time to the fabs?","Steve Sanghi","That we don't publicize. We're very good at it, and we don't want the competition to know.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And that's my follow-on either for you, Steve, or Ganesh. Good understanding of some of the cost synergies with the acquisition. I'm just kind of curious, now that you're a little bit deeper into this, whether or not you've identified some more tangible revenue synergies. And I guess, just given the more historic maybe end market focus of SMSC, help me understand the go-to-market now with the complete portfolio of both the IP from you guys and SMSC?","Steve Sanghi","Go ahead, take that, Ganesh, and I might add something later.","Ganesh Moorthy","So the revenue synergies are obviously different, depending on which of the businesses of SMSC we're talking about. The USB and Ethernet type of products probably have the greatest energy in terms of what we can do to help using our broad channels, and they tend to be closer to some of the traditional Microchip applications and channels, et cetera. Some of the other ones are more targeted by customer. There, it will take more time. We have identified that SMSC has a very deep platform-oriented approach into those markets in areas like automotive and computing and wireless audio. And there, that platform carries many other products that are similar to what Microchip's traditional microcontrollers and analog products are like and memory products are like. And as those platforms come up for redesign, we will influence those platforms to take advantage of solutions that the traditional microcontrollers, analog and memory can provide. So the work is going. There's a lot of cross-training, as I mentioned, between our sales teams, between the divisions. People are excited to look at the platform again, and also, people are working hard on the channel side to enable the channel who has a broad customer base to access, to take advantage of those products that are more appropriate there. But these are all design-in products, they're all proprietary products. And as Steve mentioned, these things will take time to show in the revenue. But it has to start at the design end of things, and that's where we have started right now.","Steve Sanghi","Broad-based effort that moves the needle will take some time, but I'm pleased to say that some of the very first designs have already been one with Microchip product in the customers where SMSC designs were. In some cases, we caught at the right time, the designs were just going to completion and we were able to replace either the microcontroller or analog or memory. I think there are a couple of examples of analog already, there are some examples of microcontroller and memory. So it does work. It's just on a broad base, it will take time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could shed some extra light on exposure to end markets following the SMSC acquisition, particularly in the automotive space.","Steve Sanghi","We are not going to break out any end markets like we historically don't. Our business remains very broad-based. We have 70,000-plus customers. Large portion of our business still is through distribution where it's much harder to break out where really the end customer is. So that's something we're not willing to break out.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Would it be fair to assume that automotive exposure has increased without breaking out any numbers?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, automotive exposure has increased. It was about 25% of their business, and it was not that much of our business. But it has slightly increased. But in percentage terms, based on their business being a lot smaller than ours, it's not a big needle mover. But yes, it has increased.","Operator","We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I feel bad asking because you did provide a lot of detail on the deal, but I'm assuming that you're going to continue to break out 8-, 16-bit and 32-bit going forward. So I was just wondering if you could dial in the base in this quarter of that roughly $35 million from SMSC.","Steve Sanghi","I don't know if I understand the question. Will we -- with the 16-bit and 32-bit growth, yes, they will include SMSC in future.","James Eric Bjornholt","We are not providing the dollar breakout for the SMSC businesses for the last quarter.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just curious. So is there no 8-bit revenue and it just goes into 16 and 32? And I was just wondering. If you don't want to give the absolute dollar, that's fine. I was just curious.","Steve Sanghi","There is 8-bit revenue and there is 16-bit revenue, there's 32-bit revenue.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Thought I figure it out. And then on the OpEx side, I just want to make sure I heard this right. It sounds like -- and given the accretion that you're talking about and the deal being a little bit lower and your comments that you're pulling back the core OpEx in the quarter, and then do you -- it sounds like given what you just said about cuts, that cuts continue into the March quarter as well for the core OpEx outside of even what you're doing with SMSC.","Steve Sanghi","I don't know what you mean by cutting the core OpEx. The cut in the core OpEx, when you say core, it means Microchip without SMSC, right?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Correct.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. So in the OpEx of Microchip without SMSC, cuts are basically coming from 3 areas. One is the pay cut for the management team I talked about. Second is the variable bonus program where bonuses will be quite low in this environment. And third is any attrition we may decide not to replace or any additions that we were planning we may very carefully look at it and drag our feet on it. So those are the 3 areas it will come from. The cuts in the OpEx of SMSC will come in all those factors, plus the result of integration where certain functions that would be consolidated.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So in aggregate, I guess, as a way of asking, when you look out into March and June, I mean, you've historically been very good about dialing back your OpEx when there's uncertainty. Do you see this OpEx line moving further down?","Steve Sanghi","I'm not sure if it moves down from March to June.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, at this point, we haven't given any guidance for revenue for March or anything else. I think we'd just like to hold off on that for now.","Operator","We'll go next to Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Steve, I just had kind of a follow-up on the commentary that you have around the June with the utilization levels, et cetera, that you're bringing down. And I'm wondering why you're giving us an outlook to June on the factory loadings. Is that because you have visibility out to June? Or is it because you're being conservative at this point given what you're seeing out there? If you could just kind of give us a little detail around the reasoning for giving us that detail.","Steve Sanghi","The reasoning for giving you that detail is I need to give some finality to the employees. I can't just put them on a rotating time off and really not have them know what does it mean, when does it end. At some point in time, people want some predictability in their life on how many hours I'm working as a full-time job. If it's forever, then they should go try to find a full-time job. If it is for a short period of time, these are long-term committed Microchip employees, they'll make their sacrifice and go along with it. So when we model it without a lot of revenue growth, we correct the inventory problem by the end of June. And with distribution building inventory and having more reasonable growth on the revenue, the time period could cut short. So that's what I'm telling the employees, that we expect this RTO, rotating time off, to go through about June, and that's what I'm telling you.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense. And just a quick follow-up on the -- around OpEx. If we do assume sort of a flattish revenue growth environment over the next several quarters and you're running at around 30.5% to 31% non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenues, the integration efforts that you're talking about completing in Q1, around the Q1 time frame, will those create a step function down towards your longer-term goal of 27.5% of revenues? Or is it going to take more time to bring OpEx down to that type of level, again, assuming sort of a flattish revenue environment?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, the 27.5% is not achievable with flat revenue from here, and I think if that's what you model, it probably would be just way too conservative. I -- this is -- with just the inventory being that low in this environment, it's pretty much at the bottom here. So if you assume flat revenue, and you said for several quarters and you probably are modeling it way, way too conservative, there will be revenue growth because without the revenue growth, you can't get to our model. The other thing is if the revenue doesn't grow in your model, then even if I bring the inventory down, I cannot still run full production. Then I still don't get the full gross margin recovery. So there has to be some business recovery either through new products or the number of new products we are launching. Ganesh talked about a couple of product lines in the analog group, similarly, we have in the microcontroller group, revenue coming from some of the synergy realized with SMSC. We absolutely will grow revenue next year.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Right. I apologize, Steve. I was just kind of -- I guess I drew a wrong conclusion on your commentary around the rotating work schedules out to June and what you had said around the flattish revenue environment driving that. So, I mean, you answered the first -- during the first part of the question, so my mistake.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Well, we want to thank you, everybody, for attending this conference call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bjornholt","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales in the September quarter were a record $1.012 billion, well above our guidance and up 4.1% sequentially from net sales of $972.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter. This was Microchip's first quarter with more than a $1 billion in sales. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.04% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 60.75%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.46% of sales, well just below the low end of our guidance of 22.5%. And non-GAAP operating income was a record 38.6%, well above the high end of our guidance of 38.25%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $344.1 million and was up 7.9% on a sequential basis and up 56.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.41, which was $0.06 higher than the midpoint of our guidance of $1.35.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 60.7% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.7 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $388.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $120.9 million, share based compensation of $19.9 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $19.9 million, consisting primarily of a $19.5 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from the public utility provider in Oregon to a lower-cost direct access provider. This change is expected to provide significant expense and cash flow savings in the future. After these adjustments, GAAP net income was a record $189.2 million or $0.77 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% in the September quarter, and the GAAP tax rate was a negative 1.6% for the quarter.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2017, was $456.9 million. Microchip had 105 days of inventory at September 30, 2017, up 5 days from the end of the June quarter. Inventory days are still well below our targeted levels but are starting to improve from our significant capacity expansion efforts as well as selective and opportunistic buy-aheads of constrained materials.","Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter continued to be low at 31 days and were flat to the June quarter levels.","The cash flow from operating activities was a record $350.1 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.844 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. We bought back 15.1 million of our 2,037 convertible bonds in the December quarter where the bondholders had elected to convert. We expect the remaining principal amount of $17.3 million of the 2,037 2 1\/8% convertible bonds to either be converted by the bondholders or called by Microchip during the December 2017 quarter. The call date for these bonds is December 15, 2017.","Capital expenditures were $59.9 million in the September 2017 quarter. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $220 million, up from our prior guidance of $180 million as we capitalize on growth and cost reduction opportunities. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.","Our capital spending also reflects 3 new buildings we are constructing in Arizona, India and Germany, which will give us meaningful lease cost reductions and avoidance in the future as well as allow us to cost-effectively scale for our future growth. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $29.9 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with how our product lines performed in the September quarter with overall sequential revenue growth of 4.1% and year-over-year growth of 15.8%, all organic growth as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last 4 quarters. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make strong progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions.","Taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business has performed strongly in the September quarter, with revenue being up 4.7% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, the September quarter microcontroller revenue was up a very strong 20%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set new revenue records. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger, and we are seeing continued growth in our design end funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.","Microcontrollers at almost $2.7 billion in annualized revenue, represented 65.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. ","To put our recent performance into perspective, in the last 5 quarters, we have grown our annualized microcontroller revenue by over $0.5 billion. All our microcontroller product lines are firing on all cylinders and driving differential growth and market share gains. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we advance the Microchip 2.0 transformation and further strengthen the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry","Now moving to our analog business. Our analog revenue was sequentially flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and up 6.3% on a year-over-year basis and also set a new record by a whisker in the process. Our analog results over the last two quarters were negatively impacted by two factors, first, the back-end capacity constraints on products with Atmel heritage, which we discussed at the last earnings call, have taken more time to resolve as the lead time for new back-end equipment has been longer-than-expected, reflecting the strong industry conditions that our suppliers are also seeing; and second, we have been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions.","This enables us to subsume competitive microcontrollers which were sitting next to our analog products as well, as include the connectivity firmware in our products so that they form total system solutions and are, therefore, much stickier design wins. These smart connectivity products are ramping nicely. And as they replace older products in new designs, our revenue classification for these new products has shifted from the analog product line to a microcontroller product line. ","Transitioning to more sticky and higher-margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in as some of the revenue growth shifts into our microcontroller product line. ","As our back-end capacity constraints continue to get relieved and the revenue from analog attach design wins start to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will grow at or above Microchip's overall growth rate. ","At over $950 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represent a 23.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.","We continue to successfully find more opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. And we are developing and introducing a wide range of new innovative and proprietary products in the linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products lines to fuel the future growth of our analog products as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion annualized revenue business for Microchip soon and a much larger business in the coming years.","Moving next to our licensing business. This business is up 3% sequentially in the September quarter and up 8.9% on a year-over-year basis, also setting a new record in the process. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes manifest in our results as the licensed processes generate royalty revenue for many years to come.","Last but not least, our memory business was sequentially up 5.3% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. There are significant cost reductions underway for this business using the combined strength of Microchip and Atmel. We believe that this effort will make us even more competitive and further improve our gross margins. ","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward.","Steve?","Stephen Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2018. I will also provide update on capacity enhancement activities, lead times as well as Microchip 2.0. Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our net sales were a new record and above our guidance, first time ever our net sales crossed a very important milestone of being above $1 billion for the quarter. Our net sales for this quarter were up 15.8% from the September quarter of a year ago, and this revenue comparison is not impacted by any acquisition since Atmel's full quarter revenue was in the September 2016 quarter results.","Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 50% from the September quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 108th consecutive profitable quarter.","There are 3 other points I would like to make on our sales growth, first, every one of our major product lines, 8-bit MCU, 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU, analog, wireless, licensing, memory and others, were up significantly in the September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter; number two, every major geography, North America, Europe and Asia, were up significantly in the September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter; and number three, sales in all end-markets were up in September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter.","Now I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontrollers solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit customer applications. On top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we're able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. We have a robust design win funnel, and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working and increasing the organic growth of Microchip.","A year ago, in September 2016 quarter, our microcontroller market share in 8-, 16- and 32-bit combined was 14.46% as per the SIA numbers. In September 2017 quarter, our market share is up to 15.84%, an increase of 138 bps in 1 year. ","Now before I go into the guidance for the December quarter, I will say that we are continuing to see good business environment for our products worldwide and have a number of company-specific demand drivers.","Our inventories at Microchip as well as the distributors are towards the low end of our normal range. We are continuing to slowly add incremental capacity at various bottlenecks. With that, our lead times have stabilized, with stable lead times we're engineering a soft landing so far without triggering any double ordering or panic from our customer base.","Our book-to-bill ratio has moderated from 1.11 in both March and June quarters to 1.05 in September quarter as the lead times stabilize. We expect the book-to-bill ratio to come down further as lead times continue to moderate, hence engineering and soft landing. At the rate we are adding capacity, we believe that it will still take us through June 2018 when our lead times return to fully normal.","Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales in the December quarter to be about flat to down 4%, which, at the midpoint, represents a growth of approximately 12.6% on a year-over-year basis. I want to remind investors that in the last 5 years, we had 3 acquisitions that closed in the middle of September quarter. ","SMSC closed in August of fiscal year '13. ISSC closed in July of fiscal year '15, and Micrel closed in August of fiscal year '16. All these 3 acquisitions had a partial quarter revenue in September quarter and a full quarter revenue in the December quarter. Therefore, mathematically taking the average of the last 5 years of sequential growth would give you a false number.","Excluding acquisitions, the average sequential decline in the December quarter over the past 5 years has been 2.5%, and ranged between plus 0.8% and minus 4.9%. Investors should compare our guidance for December quarter of flat to down 4% with an average 5-year seasonal performance of minus 2.5% in net sales and against the backdrop of a 1% beat of our FQ2 revenue guidance.","Regarding gross margins, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers that we have discussed with the investors. We expect gross margin for the December quarter to be between 61% and 61.4% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22.2% and 22.6% of sales, and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 38.4% and 39.2% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.40 per share non-GAAP.","I want to remind investors that our long-term financial model is a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.5%, operating expense of 22.5% and operating profit of 40%. And as you have seen, we are relentlessly marching towards this model. And we expect our longer-term annual revenue growth to be high single-digits. ","We believe we can grow above the industry driven by four factors, we can achieve about 1% to 2% extra growth due to our traditional market share growth continuing; we can achieve an additional 1% to 2% growth due to higher attach rate from our total system solution approach; we can achieve 1% to 2% higher growth from much less ASP erosion or stable ASPs, and we can achieve 1% to 2% higher growth from our distributor partnership approach versus competitors pulling back. And we have judged it down due to confounding effects to yield a 7% to 9% growth going forward.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Steve, if you look over the last year, growth has been very strong for you guys. Can you give us a sense of how much of that has been sort of company-specific? How much of that has been the macro? Because I think what most investors are trying to get a sense for is how much of this growth is actually sustainable as we look out into the near-to-intermediate term.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, it's very, very difficult. Customers don't have a good answer for -- that you're giving me this design. I'm winning this design. Is it because industry is doing well, or we are winning more than that? So that is a very, very hard to decipher. If you look at our last quarter, our year-over-year growth was 15.8%. We're not guiding to that. We're not expecting that. We're expecting a growth going forward of 7% and 9% with the December quarter guided at about 12.6% over the prior year December. So growth will moderate from these high numbers, and some of that excess is driven by the industry conditions.","Vivek Arya","All right. And as a follow-up, in the last few days, there's been a lot of M&A excitement in semis. And I'm wondering how you were thinking about M&A given that your leverage is at a very, very comfortable level. And at what point would you decide that it is better to resume buybacks instead of maybe going after assets that might be marked-up but with all the excitement in the industry?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, our capital allocation strategy and our thoughts have not changed since we discussed with all of you many times. Our first reference is to utilize our cash for our operations, R&D and other activities, but those are very well-funded into the P&L, and we do not need to really reach out into the balance sheet to spend excess cash. The second priority is to utilize our cash towards M&A. Our second priority is to maintain the dividend, keep growing its small amount incrementally, like we are, but not really have a very large incremental dividend program. Then our next priority is to utilize our cash for M&As. And our last priority is really to buy stock back, which we only do opportunistically.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","I guess, I just want to go back to the increase in the CapEx budget. Eric, you did, in your prepared comments, gave a sort of a good rundown of what's driving that. You did say there will be some cost savings because of that. I'm just kind of curious, does that put you sort of towards your target margin or above the target margin? And if you can help me understand what percent of the increase in CapEx is going because you just feel better about the demand, overall demand environment, versus bringing more stuff in-house?","James Bjornholt","Well, we've been talking about, for the last several quarters, there are a lot of margin improvement that we can get by bringing a lot of the outsourced Atmel activity in-house, and the percentages of our internal production versus where they've historically are out of line with where we'd like them to be. So we're making these incremental investments, and there are significant gross margins to come. We think that by making these investments, we can get to our 40% operating margins and the 62.5% gross margin goal. And it's gradual. These things come over a steady period of time. There's only so much our manufacturing and operations teams can do in any given quarter. But we've laid out a pretty aggressive plan for us to increase the production capabilities in-house, and the gross margin will improve from there.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then Steve, maybe as my follow-up, just to follow-on to Vivek's question about M&A. You've always been very disciplined about the price you're willing to pay for an asset. I think in the past, you've said, for every deal you've done, you've probably vetted and walked away from 3 or 4 deals. I'm just kind of curious. With Microchip 2.0 and your confidence level increasing that you can grow revenue faster than the industry, does that change the parameters around asset value you're willing to pay on the M&A front? And just given where the SOX index is now, any comment around asset value to your perception there would be helpful.","Stephen Sanghi","There is really no change. We have strong filters in place in our M&A analysis, which are multidimensional in terms of multiples and revenue and gross margin, operating profit growth rates and others. I can't give you all those filters, but it's a fairly complex metrics that we have to check off. And really, at various times, the assets available outside could be on the lower end of that metrics or could be on the higher end of the metrics. But they're always companies that fit the metrics. And if they go on the higher end of the metrics and even beyond that, and they're too expensive and we won't do it, but there are always companies available which still fall in the metrics.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Just a question on just the microcontroller share and as you tick through some of the things that should allow you to grow above the industry in high single-digit growth, any particular end-markets or product segments that you'd call out in terms of where you're seeing the best market share positioning?","Ganesh Moorthy","We don't go-to-market with an end-market view in order to be able to grow. We have a very broad approach to markets, applications, and a broad product line to go after them. Clearly, as the end markets strengthen in one area and other, we get participation incrementally from there. We've shown you how our automotive and industrial market share, when we presented it about 6 months ago, was that 60% of the overall revenue for us. And of course, those industries have been helping as they've had some strength. But we don't have a particular end-market that is driving us in one direction or another.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Steve. Appreciate all the color on some of the cyclical barometers around lead times and book-to-bill. As you try to kind of navigate to a soft landing, is there anything different in terms of this cycle versus prior cycles, whether it's competition with distributors and customers, inventory you're holding to kind of help navigate through that?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I think, the lead times did not get as long this time as, clearly, they have gotten some other times. The customer behavior and the distributor behavior has been much more normal this time than we have seen in the other times. So I think everybody has behaved. We wrote a letter back in April informing our customers that the industry conditions were strengthening and the lead times are going out. In the March quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11. And we wrote the letter on April 4, after we had seen this very strong bookings. And in the June quarter, our book-to-bill was, again, 1.11, which means, really, there was no panic created. No customers rushed to place large orders. They kept doing what they were doing before the letter and conformed to our lead time and placed the orders to conform to the longer lead times. And then in December quarter, book-to-bill ratio came down to 1.05 as some of the products where the lead times have moderated, and the lead times right now are anywhere from 4 weeks to 20 weeks with the products all over the place. But the products where the lead times have become shorter, the bookings on them have moderated because people have the orders in place. So I think it's a much more behaved environment this time than kind of we have seen before. I do not know what's happening with the competitors and the rest of the industry. There are scattered cases where the customer isn't willing to take one of our products because he cannot complete the kit. There's a product coming from one of the competitors or other analogs or other companies where he needs to build his entire products. And if that one is not available, they don't want ours either. But same can be said by those competitors that one of our products wasn't available so their product didn't sell. But those are scattered cases. It's not all over the place. I think environment is pretty reasonable and reasonably well-behaved.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","You spoke in the prepared remarks about subsuming competitive microcontrollers when they're next to your analog products. It sounds almost like the cross-selling opportunity is being driven from analog to the digital MCU. I would have thought that the cross-selling opportunity was much more in the other direction. Can you elaborate on this, help us understand that dynamic a little bit?","Ganesh Moorthy","It happens in both directions. So in many cases where we have the microcontroller at the center of the design, we see the breadth of what else surrounds that microcontroller early and are able to attach products. There are some specific cases where it's very complex analog and especially when it's smart connectivity, where, in addition to the analog and the connectivity function, it needs a microcontroller. And we, in many cases, enter those businesses through some of the acquired entities. We didn't have our micro controllers there to begin with. But once we now see where we are on the analog from a smart connectivity standpoint, we can begin to see what else can we subsume. And that's where it goes in the opposite direction, where the strength that came from analog gives us the ability to attach microcontrollers and, in many cases, do an integrated product that gives us more complete total system solutions in that application.","William Stein","That's helpful. If I can squeeze in one follow-up. I just want to make sure -- it's really clarification point of the last question that someone else asked. It sounds like perhaps the shortages on the passive side have been sort of clipping overall demand. I think you mentioned a moment ago about if a customer can't get a complete kit because he's short, say, a capacitor and he doesn't want your product, at least not yet until he can do a full kit, did I understand that as sort of the dynamic that might have contributed to sort of soft landing where things didn't get out of hand because, let's say, passives or some other product clipped the peak demand rate?","Stephen Sanghi","So I don't know if the others are seeing a massive number of cases where they're not able to ship the product because some passive product is not available. I think I'm kind of just seeing it sporadically where it's not large enough that, that becomes an excuse, where a number, the one way or the other. I think it's a noise level, but it's certainly a factor. It's possible that, for some other people, it's a much larger factor.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","I just want to talk a little bit about the efforts to build inventory and the timing of that. With demand slowing a bit seasonally in the December quarter, does that give you the ability to catch up on inventory somewhat? Or is that to wait until more capacity is in place a couple of quarters from now? And then with that, I have to imagine there's some gross margin benefit as you run the fabs a little harder to build the inventory. Can you quantify that benefit and talk about how that works its way into 2018?","Stephen Sanghi","So the way I will answer is, it's a continuous phenomenon. It is not digital where inventory doesn't grow this quarter, and a couple of years from now, it all grows to the right level. Our inventory grew by 5 days last quarter. Inventory will grow by some days this quarter and grow some again in March. And by June, we expect to try to get to the models. So it's a continuous phenomenon. In the stronger quarter, like we have had in the last 2 or 3 quarters, inventory was harder to grow because even though we added capacity, produced more units, we largely shipped them into the growth. Current quarter is seasonally a weak quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. So this quarter, the incremental capacity we're adding gives us the chance to add a little bit to the inventory because we can produce more than the weaker demand. But it's a continuous phenomenon. It's really not waiting for something to happen 2 quarters from now.","Ganesh Moorthy","The other thing to keep in mind is our distribution inventory is at the low end of their range as well. So us having a little extra inventory helps as we go into the growth quarters. So that combined, we have the right amount of inventory for the market.","Christopher Caso","And I'm sorry, the margin impact as the inventory is building?","Stephen Sanghi","So margin impact is essentially doesn't care about whether inventory is building or not. It cares about overall production. If you produce more in wafers assembly test, then it has better absorption and has an accretive effect. So we have been producing more units every quarter, and you have seen the margin going up every quarter. So that's also a continuous phenomenon.","Christopher Caso","Okay. As a follow-up, you had talked in your prepared remarks about a number of factors for why you think you grow faster than the inventory growing forward and what the impact would be. Can you talk about that looking backwards over the last year? And I know some factors are more difficult to measure than others. But perhaps give us a walk-through, perhaps some of these factors. And I think market share. You talked about, a little bit, pricing, how that may have affected your revenue growth over the last years compared to the industry, and what we'd say, Microchip 1.0, I guess.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, it's very difficult to numerically assign to the history and take our 15.8% growth last quarter over the previous 1 year and figure out what portion happened with price increase, what portion happened with gaining market share, what portion happened with what because it's impossible to do, 115,000-plus customers and 100,000 SKUs we are shipping. But the 4 elements that drove it in the last year and will continue to drive it going forward is really the traditional market share gains, better ASP management, either stable ASPs or increasing ASPs or less erosion. It depends on various product lines. And then achieving higher growth from our distributor partnerships, where a number of competitors are pulling back in their distribution programs, and distributions are focusing attention on us.","And the total systems approach where Ganesh talked about is happening both ways, we're able to win the microcontroller where we had a lot of analog parts by giving them a combined integrated part. And at the same time, where the customer doesn't want an integrated part, we're able to replace the competitor's analog because we have our micro end, so from both of those factors. When you combine it together, if you take 1% to 2% growth for those 4 factors, it kind of becomes 4% to 8% incremental, and we kind of have judged it down overall to come up with a 7% to 9% growth, counting the growth of the industry, whatever your assumptions are, plus a little bit more that we can do.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Danely","Steve, so you said that as the lead times are coming and the book-to-bill is dropping a little bit, is it possible that if the lead times dropped fairly suddenly in this quarter, that book-to-bill could be below 1 for the March quarter and you could potentially see some below-normal seasonality?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we are not seeing it, and we're not expecting it because there's not big capacity increments coming in because the lead time for equipment is large. Many of the test equipment, fab and other equipment, there's a lot of semiconductors that go into them. So our equipment suppliers aren't able to produce the product. And their lead times are long because they can't acquire all the semiconductors they need. So there is not big bulk of capacity coming in. Capacity is coming incrementally. And that's why I said, I think it's -- capacity is coming incrementally, and lead times are moderating slowly. And that kind of all leads to a soft landing rather than a contraction.","Christopher Danely","Okay, great. And then for my follow-up. Okay, you're talking about 7% to 9% long-term growth, and like you said, analog slowed down to, like, I think it was 6% year-over-year growth. So would you expect the microcontroller business to grow faster than analog going forward? And what would be driving like a reacceleration on the analog revenue growth?","Stephen Sanghi","I think what drives the reacceleration in analog is Atmel acquisition was a little over a year ago. And usually, you have 1 year, 1.5 years design cycle. So with Atmel, we acquired a large amount of microcontroller business. I think it was about $600 million, $700 million of their business was microcontroller, which those sockets had 0 microchip analog around it. We were the enemy. So it was anybody's analog except ours. So that was a very, very large opportunity we identified for you. We are just in the front-end of it going to production. So I think that's what accelerates the analog. Don't be fooled by just last couple of quarters of lower analog growth because, in some cases, we were already producing the integrated product. It was analog with microcontroller. And we were able to sell the package to the customer. And therefore, the revenue shifted. Rather than putting it in the analog bucket, we've put it in the microcontroller bucket.","Ganesh Moorthy","We still have that analog. It's just it's coming in [indiscernible]","Stephen Sanghi","We still have that analog, but it's counted as part of the microcontroller revenue. 98%, 99% of our microcontroller has a large amount of analog on it. But the revenue still counts as a microcontroller revenue.","James Bjornholt","Right. Any product that we ship that has a microcontroller core, we classify as a microcontroller product.","Stephen Sanghi","That's not different for anybody. Our competitors do the same. All 32-bit micro, 16-bit, 8-bit micro, they all have some power management, converters, supervisors, LDOs. And analog is built into the microcontrollers. So that's why you saw -- and there were some large designs where we captured that, and it can depress that analog sequential growth for a couple of quarters. I will not be fooled by it. There's a large amount of analog attach rate coming around Atmel's microcontrollers soon.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","You were at your target OpEx ratio in the September quarter. You'll be there as well in the December quarter. Actually, a bit better than that. So clearly, you guys are continuing to drive OpEx leverage. And I think on a go-forward basis, I think the team is going to continue to drive revenue growth faster than OpEx growth. So is there a new OpEx ratio target that we should be thinking about?","Stephen Sanghi","We have not revised them, and we're not thinking of revising them. We believe our long-term target is 22.5%. In good times, we happen to be slightly below that. And in discretionary time in the future, we could be slightly higher than that by 25 bps or something. Basically, within the range. We're not calling for substantial OpEx leverage going forward. And if the times continue to be very, very strong and the growth happens to be well above the mean, you could temporarily be in that situation. But longer-term, we've got to make the investments to grow the business.","Harlan Sur","Okay. The team is clearly executing on the Microchip 2.0 initiatives, system-level focus, more content per board. You guys have a lot of analytics platforms in-house that tracks design wins, tracks content per board. It seems like this is a contributor to the strong year-over-year growth. Can you guys quantify content increase per board on a year-over-year basis? Or any other metrics that you use to gauge success in terms of value capture per system?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we have a propriety indicator. We certainly don't want competitors or anybody else to know. So for the last several years, we have been tracking average number of Microchip's parts per customer design. And that is growing, and growing significantly. So that is the measure of the success of the TSS effort. We want to share that success with you qualitatively, not quantitatively.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Just within your microcontroller business, can you say which products are growing the fastest, both on units and revenue?","Stephen Sanghi","I would think 32-bit microcontrollers are growing the fastest, 16-bit microcontrollers next and 8-bit microcontroller next. Given that, all 3 are making record quarter-after-quarter.","Kevin Cassidy","Right. So not so much on a like-to-like basis. Your ASPs, in general, are trending up because you're selling more 32-bit.","Stephen Sanghi","That could be true if you just look at the average microcontroller ASP. But then the average COGS would be going up, too, because 32-bit products cost more to make it than 8 or 16.","Kevin Cassidy","Right. Yes. Just some investors are concerned about you outgrowing your end-markets. But if your end markets are shifting to higher ASP devices, then it justifies why you'd outgrow your end-market.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes. Okay.","Kevin Cassidy","No, just checking to see if you agree with that.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes. I agree with that.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.","Christopher Rolland","So your lead times have increased, but some others, like some European MCU guys, their lead times have expanded well beyond yours. So overall, do you think you guys have net gained or lost share because of competitive lead times in the industry?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, the numbers say we have gained share, and I've given you the numbers. The year-ago in the September quarter, our microcontroller revenue divided by SIA revenue was 14.46%. And in the September quarter that we are announcing today, our share was 15.84%. So that's an increase of 130 bps in 1 year. That's one of the significant increase in market share in 1 year. We used to gain that kind of share years ago. And lately, the gains have been slower. So this was a very significant increase. But I don't think the reason for the share gains is just because the competitive lead times have gone longer than ours. In microcontroller, you cannot gain the share like that.","You have to have design done with your product, which is 1.5 years, it takes to put your part in the design. So these were the designs we won 1 year ago, 2 years ago. The lead times of competitors does not have an effect on it. It may have effect onwards because we're winning more designs now, and some of the more designs we're winning today could be because customers are unhappy with their competitors. That will lead to higher share next year and the year after. But the share we gained last year had nothing to do with the lead time.","Christopher Rolland","I see. And then you guys had some interesting commentary, I thought, on the direct energy access provider in Oregon. I'm assuming maybe direct hydroelectric or something. What's the nearly $20 million upfront charge? And then what kind of benefit do we get, maybe gross margin or something like that, going forward from that?","James Bjornholt","So there's a transition fee that you have to pay when you make that change. And that fee essentially covers a 4- or 5-year period. And so from a cash flow perspective, the cash flow savings come at a later date. But the P&L, just with the way the accounting works, the income statement benefit will start getting that impact in our cost here over the next couple of quarters. And then it will get capitalized to inventory, and we'll get the benefit later. So there are incremental savings. That's a good change for us. We think it's going to drive better cost and better cash flow for us in the future. But essentially, it's a transition fee that were being paid, and that's why we have the onetime charge.","Christopher Rolland","And can you quantify at all? Or is it just too small?","James Bjornholt","It's too small in the big-picture overall gross margin.","Ganesh Moorthy","Clearly, it was good enough for us to be able to make a substantial investment, and it accrues for many, many years.","Stephen Sanghi","It will be 1 of our 3 fabs, plus 40% our business comes from foundries. I mean, it's one of the factor in gross margin, along with all the other drivers, which are more analog, higher yields, shrinks, taking Atmel products, bringing them in for assembly and test. And all of these other margin drivers we have talked to you about, this is kind of just one of them, but not really on the top of the list.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","In the past, you only use to go out to 1 quarter on giving results. And now you talked 7%, 9% gain, which is great. And I'll have to go through what you said in your last commentary. But what do you see? Is it just the addition of products that you sell which is giving your 7% to 9% gain? And how long does it continue like this?","Stephen Sanghi","So Gil, in the last conference call commentary, I had talked about high single-digit. And somewhere along on the investor circle, it got translated into 7% to 9%. But my exact words were high single-digit if you go back and listen to it. And I didn't disagree with that. High single-digit sounds like about 7% to 9% or somewhere there. In this conference call, I broke them into 4 different events, as I said earlier, which was traditional market share gains, TSS attach, distributor partnership approach, and I don't which was the fourth one.","Ganesh Moorthy","ASPs.","Stephen Sanghi","Stable ASPs or increasing ASPs. So when you said in the past, we only did not talk about long-term. We didn't have these 4 differentiated drivers. We didn't have a portfolio rich enough to drive the total system solution. A few years ago, we were not driving ASPs to be as stable or higher. Some of the industry consolidation as well as our own efforts have created the environment where you can keep the ASP stable. So things have changed. Years ago, our competitors were not pulling away from distribution. Today, they are. And we are approaching them, and they're putting more focus on it. So things have happened, which had given us the opportunity. And we're capitalizing on those opportunities so we're able to quantify and guide that we can grow higher. And the last part of your question was, how long does it continue? I don't know. I really don't know.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Congratulations on crossing that $1 billion mark with revenue. First question is actually on some of the proposed tax reform changes in the U.S. I guess, a couple of parts related to that topic. I know it's early, but any sense at this point what it may mean for Microchip's consolidated effective tax rate? And given the proposed rate for repatriating foreign cash, how is Microchip thinking about managing its overseas cash balance?","Stephen Sanghi","I think a general answer on that is that we haven't fully evaluated it. And proposed is just a proposal. A lot of other proposals that have come out on tax rate, health care and other, and not much has happened in Washington. And there's really not much reason to burn calories on it. I don't really know if there is support in Senate with a number of senators against anything that they want to do. So I think it's kind of too early. But if something were to happen, tax law were to change, we'll be upfront in fully understanding it, utilizing our foreign cash and thinking about all the possibilities that exist to take advantage of it and I think may add some more.","James Bjornholt","I think that's exactly right. It's too early. Our tax group and advisors are looking at what's being proposed. So we kind of have to see what actually comes to fruition here, and we'll respond accordingly.","Mark Delaney","That's helpful. And as for follow up on IoT. I know that's been a part of the company's growth strategy in the past. And I realized, Microchip has a more stringent criteria over what counts as IoT versus not IoT. But maybe if you can just level for us at this point how much revenue you think is tied to IoT and what your outlook is for that part of the business.","Ganesh Moorthy","We haven't broken out IoT as a revenue segment. We have done it a couple of times in the past just to provide some more insight at that point. The strategy for the company that we've explained is around providing smart connector and secure solutions. And all of what IoT requires are those 3 big ingredients. And a large chunk of our product line today is feeding the requirements of what would be classified as IoT. So it is a growth driver for us. We see a lot more applications that are building the connected and the secure capabilities. And we have the strong product line to be able to take advantage of that. But unfortunately, I don't have a good way to estimate the IoT-specific revenue.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Eric, just going back to the CapEx. If you look with the raise that you guys announced today, it puts your CapEx to rev over 5% for this fiscal year. It has historically run at sort of 4% to 4.5%. Should we expect CapEx to come back down to that range in fiscal year '19? Or how do we think about the long-term target for CapEx?","James Bjornholt","So you're right. The percentage is higher. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 3 buildings in Chandler, India and Germany that were -- that are kind of, I'll call them, onetime items to help with future lease cost or avoidance of lease cost. So that's one thing. And the other piece is we've got all the Atmel products that were outsourced historically, where we can get very fast return on those investments from a cash flow payback perspective that were -- that it's very much worthwhile from gross margin perspective to make those investments. And those are bit out of the ordinary. So we don't expect, long-term, to be at the 5% rate, but the investments that we're making today definitely are worthwhile and cost-beneficial. So hopefully, that's the color that you're looking for.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Steve, I wanted to follow-up with the earlier comments regarding some of the company-specific drivers to the high single-digit growth. You mentioned lower ASP declines, distribution, analog attached and traditional share gain. My question is, as we look at those 4 company drivers for Microchip, is the company getting optimal benefit from each of those right now? Or are there things that are more formative or early innings that would give us more benefit next year? And if so, what are they?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes. I think he's trying to kind of figure out which are more fully baked in, which ones coming in time. I would say, when you look at TSS, the gains from TSS are going to be accruing as we go into in that coming 1, 2 years of time. Those are typically design-driven. It takes complete design cycle from when we begin to engage, are able to attach and those attached designs to go to production. So I think that's one of the larger ones ahead. Clearly, some of the changes in distribution took place within the last year. That change in engagement, again, takes time. It's new designs that you're affecting, I think. So I think the best of what's to come is ahead of us from some of the changes that Steve described.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Steve, you had mentioned -- or Ganesh, sorry, you mentioned your smart connectivity strategy. And obviously, you talked about attach rates for analog increasing as a drive for overall growth. Can you talk about a little bit -- if you can maybe quantify where we are in terms of the attach rates maybe for the Atmel products? And kind of where do you expect that to go in the future?","Ganesh Moorthy","Qualitatively, it's still low because when we inherited the Atmel product lines and those designs with our customers, they didn't have much microchip attached in them. Now our sales teams and our overall microchip teams have been working on new designs as they come up to be able to showcase the rest of the Microchip product line and to increase that attach. Now we can see the leading indicators in how we see our own design-in activity. Some of the indicators Steve talked about, which is as we measure the rate of attach that's taking place over time. And so in the revenue numbers themselves, they are still yet to come, especially on the Atmel part of the product line. And there may be small things that have taken place. But as time goes on, all these designs, as they go through the 12- to 24-month incubation period, start to go into production, and that's when you begin to see the growth and the revenue that comes from that attach.","Rajvindra Gill","And just a follow-up. So is it fair to assume of that $600 million of Atmel microcontroller revenue that they've generated, that over that design period, whether it's 24 months or more, that a certain percentage of that will start to be attached with the microcontroller core? Can you maybe talk about what the adversive effect on the ASPs would be?","Ganesh Moorthy","So in general, when you look at the dollars per board, we're driving towards increasing the dollar content per board. So attach is taking place, as we mentioned earlier, in 2 ways. And one way, it is where we have the microcontroller. Ours or what came to us through the Atmel acquisition. In that case, the microcontroller is still the microcontroller that Microchip or Atmel had been shipping, but that incremental dollar content of the board. And the other way is where, if we have some of the richer analog product lines, and they don't always come from Atmel, only they come from some of our older acquisitions as well, where we are now providing a higher integration solution, a microcontroller with that analog, perhaps with security, something else onboard. Now those products, the ASP will go up because more often than not, we didn't own the microcontroller portion of that design. We have the analog portion and we are subsuming other people's silicon with our new products. And there, the ASP, we do expect and we do see going up.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions in the queue at this time. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Sanghi, for any additional or closing remarks.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we want to thank everyone for joining the call. I think the next conference we go to is CSFB.","James Bjornholt","Credit Suisse.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes, which is in our backyard here in Scottsdale.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel and Micrel acquisitions. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we're including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to those results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record and at the high end of our guidance at $568.4 million and were up 3% sequentially from net sales of $552 million in the immediately preceding quarter.","Non-GAAP net sales were $10.8 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contracts that Micro previously had for certain of their distribution partners. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were 58.4% in the March quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance, and non-GAAP operating income was 31.4% of sales, which was significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 30.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $153 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.70, which was also above the high end of our guidance.","For fiscal 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.214 billion and up 2.5% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.1%, operating expenses were 27.2% of sales, and operating income was 31% of sales. Net income was $583.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.68 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis net sales were $557.6 million and gross margins were 54.3% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation, $5.4 million of gross margins impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $18.2 million in acquired inventory valuation costs, and the manufacturing vendor material issues of $3.6 million.","Total operating expenses were $222.8 million or 40% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.1 million, share-based compensation of $15.4 million, $5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP net income was $67.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.","For fiscal year 2016 GAAP net sales were a record $2.173 billion, gross margins were 55.5%, operating expenses were 39.3% of sales, and operating income was 15.2% of sale. Net income was $324.1 million or $1.49 per diluted share.","In the March quarter the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 16.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate does not reflect a $12.3 million benefit or non-recurring items associated with the tax audit settlement and other matters. Including Atmel, we expect our longer term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at March 31, 2016 was $306.8 million. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments flowing through the income statement, Microchip had 117 days of inventory at March 31, 2016, which is down by three days from the levels at the end of the December quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was 32 days, which is down two days from the December quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.","Atmel had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through revenue recognition in its distribution channel. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Atmel distributors for the entire June quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end market demand for our product. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in Atmel's sell-through distribution channel at the date of the acquisition will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes and also because some of the contracts with the Atmel distributors drive sell-in revenue recognition for GAAP accounting purposes.","The cash generation in the March quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $196.3 million. This includes a $22 million cash benefit from unwinding the interest rate swap that we had in place. The swap was unwound as our natural hedge of floating rate debt went away by utilizing our cash to fund the Atmel acquisition. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.665 billion; our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of March 31 were $1.052 billion.","Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels, and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $16.5 million in the March quarter and $97.9 million in fiscal 2016, well below the $110 million forecast we provided on our last earnings call. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $140 million, including Atmel.","We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $26.2 million and $103.9 million for fiscal year 2016.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll give you a summary of our product line performance and then provide an update as to where we are with the Atmel integration from a product line perspective. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 5.5% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter as we experienced a broad-based recovery in our business. All three businesses \u2013 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers \u2013 were sequentially up with the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses being up in double-digit percentages. Microcontrollers represented 59.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2015. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again gained market share in 2015. In the 16-bit microcontroller market too, we continued to gain market share, while in the 32-bit microcontroller market, our market share was about flat.","The microcontroller market share data reported by Gartner is getting increasingly volatile, driven by the inclusion of smart card and NFC revenue, and is further exacerbated by our belief that this data is inconsistently reported by the company's survey. Smart card and NFC revenue has no bearing on the broad-based microcontroller market, which is a much more resilient and profitable business and where Microchip participates.","We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market. Our overall microcontroller results are outperforming the market in a very competitive environment, and these results are a tribute to the relentless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained market share and we have a new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The addition of Atmel microcontrollers to our portfolio will further strengthen our position and performance in the microcontroller market.","Moving now to analog products, our analog business was about flat in the March quarter as compared with the December quarter, and was up 34.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, our analog business was up 26.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The strong growth and increase in market share in fiscal year 2016 was a result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 30.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power interface, and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Moving now to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was down 1.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our Memory business represented 4.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","Now, an update about Atmel and where we are in the integration process. Since the close of the acquisition on April 4, we have spent considerable time understanding Atmel's businesses, organization, and systems. We're developing detail integration plans that are in various stages of completion. Where we've decisions made we begun to execute those plans while we continue to build and refine integration plans in other areas.","Specific to the product lines here is where we're with our integration. We have combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under a single leader. The 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had atrophied under Atmel over the last five years as resources were diverted to touch and 32-bit microcontrollers. That stopped on April 4 as we reprioritized resources to reinvigorate the iconic AVR microcontrollers to drive growth. We expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers over the next 12 months that will lead its resurgence even as we continue to release a steady stream of innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.","We have also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microprocessor business along with Microchip's 32-bit microcontroller business under a single leader. 32-bit microprocessors, by the way, are a new product category for Microchip and are typically higher-performance and complex embedded control solutions. Unlike microcontrollers, which are Flash memory on chip, microprocessors have no Flash memory on chip and instead use much larger external Flash memories. Microchip had a PIC 32 microprocessor program, which was in its early stage of investment, and we have decided to terminate that investment as we can capitalize on Atmel's SAM 32 microprocessor roadmap, which is more advanced and already in significant revenue stage. Looking forward, we expect to continue to develop new SAM 32 and PIC 32 products exploiting specific areas of specialization that each company had carved out over the years while streamlining and harmonizing the technology and intellectual property building blocks that each will use.","We have combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under a single leader. The product lines have some overlap and roadmaps are in the process of being rationalized to bring the investment in line with what is appropriate for the business. In that light, one decision we made was to close Atmel's Dresden wireless development center in mid-April. There is more wireless investment rationalization that is left to do.","We have combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under a single leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products and while we will continue to support both product lines for any customer who cannot switch, for the great majority of the customers we will converge to a best-of-breed product which has the lowest overall cost and best overall customer value. We have also begun rationalizing the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel.","Atmel's touch business is in the process of being restructured into mobile and non-mobile, which is essentially the automotive and industrial businesses. We have identified the leadership structures required for two independent businesses. As we announced on April 4, the automotive and industrial touch business will stay with Microchip in the long run while the Mobile Touch business will be sold. We expect to have the two organizations in place sometime in this quarter and to begin marketing the Mobile Touch business soon after.","Atmel's security solution business consists of a number of Crypto products. This is a newer field of play for Microchip and Atmel's offerings will add to and strengthen our security offerings as well as accelerate some of the solutions that Microchip had planned to independently develop. Steve will comment in more detail in his section about how we expect to see the accretion results roll out.","Finally let me provide an update on Atmel's acquisition \u2013 on the Atmel acquisition in regards to our product line reporting. Atmel's standard microcontroller revenue including the automotive and industrial touch microcontrollers will be reported as part of Microchip's microcontroller product line. Atmel's analog revenue, which is predominantly made up of products for the automotive market will be reported as part of Microchip's analog product line. Atmel's memory revenue will be reported as part of Microchip's memory product line.","Atmel had a product line called multi-market, which included the aerospace business, the legacy CPLD business, and their foundry services business. Microchip will adopt multi-market as a product line we report and we'll roll the revenue from our historical other product line, which consisted of manufacturing services, into this multi-market product line. Further, Atmel also has some legacy ASIC microcontrollers comprising either discontinued products, or products which had not had any investment for many years. We intend to include revenue from these products in the multi-market product line as well.","As we mentioned during our April 4 conference call, Atmel's Mobile Touch business will be classified as an asset held for sale and we will only report the net profit or loss for this business below the operating line of Microchip's income statement.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward, and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you Ganesh and good afternoon everyone.","Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and the newly acquired Atmel.","Our March quarter financial results were very strong amidst a weak semiconductor industry backdrop. We achieved the high end of our net sales guidance, establishing a new record in the process, and we exceeded the high end of the guidance for non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage, and earnings per share.","Our non-GAAP earnings per share was sequentially up approximately 11% from the December quarter due to improving sales, gross margin, and operating expense leverage. I hope that emphatically demonstrates the operating leverage left in our premium business model.","Before I go into guidance, let me give you a brief update on the integration of Micrel and Atmel. On Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The two items remaining are both in the manufacturing area. The integration of backend operations into Microchip Systems is on schedule for August. The other item is the closing of the fab, and we have an update on that.","We could have closed Micrel fab in August by building a large amount of inventory for the customers to switch to Microchip's 8-inch fabs. But as we have analyzed options after the Atmel purchase, we believe that a couple of processes are better transferred from the Micrel 6-inch fab to Atmel's 6-inch fab in Colorado Springs. This will require less inventory and result in lower risk to the customers and business units. Therefore, we are transferring the process to Atmel's fab, and we will structure the Micrel fab to a very small operation largely running a couple of those processes until they are qualified in the Atmel fab. We believe this will delay the final close of the Micrel fab by four months to December of 2016.","The financial model of Micrel is starting to look very good. Recall that when we purchased Micrel about nine months ago, it was making a gross margin of 48.4% and the operating profit was 6.7% of revenue. In the December 2015 quarter, we achieved 49.5% gross margin and 18% operating profit from Micrel. I'm happy to report that in the March 2016 quarter, we achieved 53.2% gross margin and 22.8% operating profit from Micrel. We now believe that after we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will exceed 30% and will be above our original model.","By the way, Supertex integration is complete. Final result: gross margin in the high 60s, and the operating expenses are really intertwined, so harder to decipher. But safe to say that the operating profit is in the 30s.","Now, regarding Atmel, Ganesh provided the progress report on the integration of product lines of Atmel. There's not a whole lot more beyond that with just one month gone. We're in the process of cross-franchising Microchip and Atmel distributors, and we're sorting through all the overlaps in rep coverage in major accounts.","I will now provide guidance for the June 2016 quarter. We started out June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into January, and the bookings and turns for the quarter so far have been strong. The Chinese New Year holidays in Asia are also behind us, although this is traditionally a slower quarter in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter net sales without Atmel to be up between 1% to 5% sequentially or between $574.1 million and $596.9 million. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin, again without Atmel, to be between 58.2% and 58.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.6% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share without Atmel to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share.","With this, let me now provide guidance for attrition from the acquisition of Atmel. There are two items that we need to be mindful of as we look at guidance for Atmel's net sales. First, while Atmel reported its net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition to distributors in Asia, Microchip will report Atmel's non-GAAP sales based on a sell-through revenue recognition worldwide.","Secondly, Microchip will report the Mobile Touch portion of Atmel's business as an asset held for sale and will report this business unit's profit or loss below the net operating profit of Microchip and will exclude this net profit or loss for non-GAAP purposes.","Now, based on that, we expect Atmel to add approximately $225 million to $245 million in net sales for the continued businesses. We expect the continuing business of Atmel to be between 46% to 47% in gross margin, and we expect the Atmel subsidiary to be between 0 to $0.05 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share.","So now, let's combine the guidance for core Microchip and Atmel. We expect June quarter net sales to be between $799.1 million and $841.9 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 to $0.79 per share. We continue to expect that Atmel will be about $0.25 accretive to Microchips non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal year 2017.","In closing, I would like to say that March quarter marks the start of the growth period for us after ending the inventory correction in the December quarter. In case of Atmel, the inventory on the balance sheet and the distribution inventory is still high and there is still some inventory correction to go through that is baked into our guidance. Combining growth from our core business, further accretion coming from Micrel, and the accretion from Atmel, this triple effect will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to an 18% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. And we first move to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thank you for allowing me to ask question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. On the Atmel business, can you talk about the growth in the various segments that you have analyzed after you acquired? Which are the segments you think is going to grow and how do you think you're going to position your products along with their products and strategically grow both product lines?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","It's a little early for all the growth areas. Obviously we're coming up to speed in the different businesses. The investment roadmaps have been what they were. They were focused on 32-bit in touch alone. There wasn't as much on 8-bit. We see that as a potential area of growth for us going forward. There is some growth we believe in security, certainly in the microcontroller \u2013 32-bit microcontroller and wireless areas that they have invested in. It's a little early to give you any specific numbers. We're working on that. We also have to look at how to balance that with investments Microchip has also been making in similar areas. So that's with respect to growth.","On the positioning, I think we've very clear ways in, which products have areas of strength that they have developed. On 8-bit the AVR has a strong following a wide base of customers and applications, and so does the PIC microcontrollers. The biggest opportunity on that is going to be how do we take our analog products and create more attach around both company's efforts? Obviously we've been doing that on 8-bit for a long time now doing it for the AVR 8-bit as well.","On 32-bit, microprocessors is an area that Atmel had as a strength. We hadn't been doing it. We will take that and run with it, and again, position the rest of our product lines to attach with their microprocessors. We expect on the microcontrollers that are ARM based as well as MIPS-based microcontrollers that will have PIC 32 and SAM 32 products. They each have different uniqueness around them have gone after slightly different markets. In some cases there could be commonality of customers. And so largely, on the microcontrollers, we're not expecting that these big shakeups in the roadmap. And then outside of microcontrollers really the rest of the product lines are reasonably well positioned.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Just as a follow-up on the synergies from Atmel acquisition could you provide a split-up between how much will come from the COGS side things and OpEx side of things for fiscal 2017 and then maybe in out years will that incrementally be more on the COGS side or the OpEx side?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are not able to break down the synergies in OpEx or the COGS side or revenue growth. We've given combined numbers of the earnings per share accretion for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 and you know a month after the acquisition as we've looked at it we're pretty much confirming that we can achieve those numbers.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Just a question on kind of the IoT piece of business, Steve. If you can just touch on you know how you're seeing design activity there and the relative growth of those type of products versus the overall MCU business?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our wireless business has been doing quite well for quite some time. And honestly, we're surprised about where Atmel got some of the reputation on being well positioned in IoT. As we looked at it now closer as we own it, the wireless business was less than half of Microchip's business and losing a very large amount of money. So we are dramatically restructuring Atmel's wireless business, combining with our wireless business, and coming up with a combined roadmap \u2013 some products from us, some products from them. In fact, just today we closed one of the design centers of their wireless, which was based in Dresden, Germany. But Microchip had a very strong momentum on wireless, and taking some of the good products from Atmel, it will further aid to it. But their wireless business wasn't really cracked up to really what they positioned it with the analysts and investors.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as my follow-up for a comment on just the current environment. As you mentioned, this is a sort of growth period for you. Any anecdotes you can kind of point you in terms of as you made your way through the inventory correction, whether it's customer behavior or distributors, and how the business is being managed?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you talking about Microchip's core business or Atmel's business?","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Microchip's core.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So our business is running normal. We completed the inventory correction back in December quarter. As we reported, the distribution inventory was basically flattish. It was down by two days last quarter. Our internal inventory seems reasonable. So I don't really think there's movement going in either direction. I think the business is really normal. Our business represents the real demand today.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question, and thanks for all the detail of the conference call. Steve, I guess my first question is if I adjust for the Mobile Touch business at Atmel, it looks like the June guide is sort of implying flat to down kind of 8%, maybe like down 4% at the midpoint. I'm just kind of curious to what extent do you think this is just a hangover of some of the distribution inventory problems you had versus maybe a portfolio that wasn't as strong as you had originally thought? And I guess, importantly, when do you think you get the core Atmel business back to some level of sequential and year-over-year growth?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, there were probably more than one question in there, but the Mobile Touch business of Atmel that we didn't include is about $14 million a quarter. So if you add it to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided, it's about $250 million. So it's really neither way up or down much.","We basically feel that Atmel was in the middle of a very major inventory correction. There was a very, very large amount of distribution inventory as well as the inside inventory. We have seen some of that behavior with sell-in driven companies in our prior acquisitions also, but this one was really over the top. As we announced back on April 4, that \u2013 based on a sell-in driven revenue recognition, the revenue was only in the $220 million range. So there was really a massive inventory correction in distribution. If they were standalone then the revenue would just have been very, very low.","And I think the second part of your question was when do we see growth. We believe we see stabilization beginning now, and it continuously improves. We are improving Atmel's systems on many different fronts, and you'll see the second half of this year to be significantly better than what you've seen in the first half.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's all for Steve. And maybe for my follow-up I know this doesn't impact the non-GAAP guidance you gave, but when you report sort of the below-the-line loss or gain from the Mobile Touch business, did you expect that business to be profitable? Is it a loss? And how we think about getting rid of that business relative to your accretion targets for Atmel?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So the business is about $14 million in revenue, low-30s gross margin, and 33% range kind of gross margin, and it's losing money. And part of the issue is its expenses are extremely high and kept high by Atmel management, while the revenue was falling steeply down over the last year and the year before. So what we are doing is very, very aggressively cutting its operating expenses to size the business accordingly to get it close to profitability. And with that, we will market that business to be able to sell it.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon and nice job on the quarterly execution. Your 16-bit and 32-bit businesses grew double digits sequentially in March. It's pretty solid results in a tough demand environment. I know you say broad-based, but any color, geography or end market-wise, as to the strong growth drivers? I know automotive continues to be an area of strength, but any color you can provide will be appreciated here.","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","There's nothing I can point my finger to and say this is what it was. Both businesses are like our overall microcontroller business. They are broad-based, thousands of customers, many, many, many different applications. And that work takes place over the years to establish those new designs. And as any overall improvement environment happens, we see that improvement in our business across a wide range of applications and customers. So nothing specific I can point to.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I know the team had previously mentioned that China did not fall off a cliff in the March quarter. It's maybe the market (37:02). Is the team expecting the core Microchip China business to grow in the June quarter? Again auto in China appears to be an area of strength. I know you've got broad-based exposure here, but again, any areas in China that you're seeing strength? Is it more just inventory replenishment or do you think that is true demand pull?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes, absolutely. Our June quarter business in China will be up sequentially over the March quarter. We were not able to break down by industry because we just don't roll up the revenue that way. It's broad-based. We are up in direct. We are up in distribution, so it's really fairly broad-based. Our China business will definitely be up in the March quarter.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","It's really always up in June following the Chinese New Year funk that happened in the March quarter. So it's just a higher number of shipping days, but the demand environment is fine.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the insights.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the nice job in the quarter. Steve, I wanted to start off with a higher-level question. The team has had four weeks to be on the inside of the Atmel business. Could you summarize for us what your biggest takeaways are now that you're on the inside looking at that business versus what you thought you were getting when you closed the deal a month ago?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a thoughtful question and probably requires a thoughtful answer. I think if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are companies at the bottom that have been underperforming for years. They are being forced by either their boards or the activists investors to seek strategic alternatives, which is another word for basically selling the company. Such consolidation is now taking place in the semiconductor industry, and we have been kind of one of the consolidators. Microchip has purchased a number of companies that were all underperforming, and in each of these companies we found some negative surprises after we bought the companies. But Microchip has systematically transformed the companies that we have bought into highly profitable enterprises performing in the Microchip business model. I've given you examples of SMSC, Micrel, and Supertex before. And we believe that we'll be able to do the same with Atmel. We have competed Atmel for years. What we knew of Atmel from outside was that they have very good products and technology. And a month after we have purchased them we've confirmed that many of Atmel's product and technologies are good, and they fit very well with Microchip's products, technologies, and our roadmaps.","But at the same time, we always wondered why Atmel, with such good products and technologies, always underperformed and could not make even a third of the profit that Microchip made. We now have a deeper understanding of that. And the easiest way to describe that is they were very poorly managed. I will put that in five main buckets. First, very poor accountability for results. I mean, kept giving bonuses and raises or whatever, irrespective of the performance of the company. So very poor accountability for results. Number second, poor teamwork. As we have seen, teamwork between sales and operations and planning and inventory and just everybody does what they need to do, and very poor teamwork. Number three, very high spending culture. Obviously, operating expenses in excess of 40% of revenue. Number four, always swinging for homeruns and essentially getting struck out, versus Microchip building its businesses with singles and doubles. And finally, number five, very poor pricing discipline.","So I think those are the five areas we've diagnosed. Again, poor accountability for results, poor teamwork, very high spending culture, swinging for fences for the homeruns, and very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have now combined most of Atmel's business units under Microchip leaders so that we can begin to teach and implement our system of teamwork, accountability, operating expense, discipline, broad customer base, and strong pricing discipline. As we have done with SMSC, Supertex, and Micrel, we'll be sharing that progress with the investors and analyst in the coming quarters. Atmel is not the first company and that I've been stressed over after purchasing them, but I'm confident that just like in other cases investors will like the results we deliver as we transform Atmel's good products and technologies to yield kind of Microchip kind of financial performance. So that's kind of how I see it.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank for that detail. The follow-up question is one related to prepared comments, and it deals with integration, some of the operational aspects of the new business, and it's in regards to the distribution channels and the sales teams. How long does it take to do a full cross selling training on each of the portfolios with the different channels and when do you expect to start to get the design win synergy off of that cross training?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say it takes about three months to launch it, another six months to train it, and you start getting design wins in the second half, probably, after six, seven months. And then remember, production is another year, year and half, away at some earlier wins on analog and attach and places where the time to revenue could be shorter.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and the last question is for Ganesh. Ganesh, I appreciate the careful walk through the product groups and the way Atmel is integrating with Microchip. I didn't hear you mention the 16-bit business. Where does that fit as the portfolios come together under either standalone leadership or leadership with one of the groups you did mention?","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. So, that's easy. There was no 16-bit business at Atmel. Microchip's 16-bit business continues as a standalone business.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we next move to Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks, Steve. I was going to ask a lot of questions but your response to the last prompted to me ask this one. So with Atmel's culture being pretty screwed up, A, have you had an acquired company that's been this bad? And, B, if you could share any anecdotes, and then perhaps talk to us about how long you think it will take get things in line there?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think I kind of have been on record that this is probably the worst performing company I bought, and the size and scale of it kind of makes it that much more challenging. But we've a deep experience inside of Microchip. The people we have prepared and battle-hardened to do these integrations over many, many different acquisitions. Remember, we have done acquisition in memory, which was SST. We've done acquisitions in wireless before. We have done acquisitions in logic businesses like SMSC. We have acquired manufacturing assets before where we bought one of the test plant MMT. We bought a fab plant in Oregon. So across our diverse management structure, we have deep expertise in integrating acquired companies across many, many disciplines.","And the entire \u2013 that trained and battle-hardened management team of Microchip is really at work at Atmel where essentially all but one or so of the divisions are today \u2013 business units are being led by a Microchip executive, and we're basically making the operational changes, the cultural changes, the teamwork changes. We have set up meetings already where operations and business units are in a common meeting, figuring out what the demand is, what we should build. Those things were not connected. Basically, business units throw a demand over the wall and the manufacturing group will invent and build it, and sales never booked that order and never won that design, and there are lots and lots of millions or parts sitting written off. And there was a very, very high amount of inventory write-off at Atmel when we look at the history of that. And it doesn't compare anything with Microchip where we are really well run, and rare that you have any kind of large inventory write-off.","So we're implementing all of Microchip's processes, and as we implement Microchip's processes, then lot of the gross margin and other improvement will just happen because you don't write off the inventory, there's a better pricing discipline, there's less OpEx, and people are working together, all that kind of stuff.","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","Chris, I will also add there are lots and lots of great employees at Atmel, so, many of whom were yearning for an improvement in system and who are responding extremely well to our presence, our values. And so \u2013 we've seen this in other companies as well, that once you go below the top level, there are lots and lots of excellent employees who will be a big part of the contribution as we bring in the improvements that we need to make. And we already see lots of those people are thrilled to be liberated and to be able to thrive in the systems that we bring.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We always say that management works on the system and employees work in the system. So employees work in a system with very little accountability and they were not empowered to really make, maybe possibly, the improvements that they could have made. And system was very top-down; there was too much bureaucracy in the system. As we have traveled to all the Atmel sites internationally, in places, that team has constantly come that there was so much central command and control from the headquarter where it took levels and levels of approvals and just there was a constipation of the funnel, essentially, where nothing got approved and nothing got done.","And ours is a very distributed intelligence and distributed decision-making, and people empowered, where they work by our values. They know what they need to do, And so lots of people as we've travelled from Norway to France to Germany to Colorado Springs to other have really embraced us and said this is the kind of culture they have been yearning for.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations as well. This is a question with respect to Atmel's growth rate, and I think you touched upon it a little bit. But just want to get some more clarity. If you look at Atmel's revenue in 2015, it declined about 17% year-on-year, roughly. Now, there were a lot of one-time items that were contributing to that fall you've calculated. But I wanted to get a sense of kind of how you're looking at Atmel's three-year or long-term growth rate, putting aside some of the one-time events that occurred in 2015 and given the fact that two thirds of Atmel's revenue is really microcontrollers and your strategy of really kind of focusing on the two-thirds of the business. How do we look at kind of Atmel's longer-term growth rate?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think any answer we give either would mean nothing, or you won't believe it. So one month after this, when I'm ready to talk about what happens to Atmel's revenue three years from now? What we're seeing is that there was a very, very large shipments into distribution where distribution inventory was out of sight and when you then measure revenue by selling the revenue had a steep fall off in the later quarters, which is what you're counting in a significant revenue drop of Atmel in 2015, and I'm not disagreeing that the revenue was down 17%, 17.5%.","From the number that we're guiding you today we see this number to be the starting point of stabilization in Atmel's revenue. There is some more distribution inventory correction to go through, so the second half of this year should be stronger than the first half. Now, beyond that, with the better execution, combined roadmap, the good pricing discipline, great distribution methodology, our cross-selling distributor on each of those products, analog attach, and others, we need to produce a growth rate from Atmel which is at least as much as the industry. I don't think that will be that difficult from how atrophied it is. And we've seen that in our other acquisitions. Beyond that I can't really add the numbers to it.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Well, that's helpful, at least in terms of the thought process. Just following up, again, the microcontroller business is \u2013 put aside the changes in the revenue recognition \u2013 is roughly two-thirds of the Atmel's business. And then you have obviously the non-volume memory, RF auto, and multi-market....","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So it's not true that we're only focusing on the microcontroller business. We have two of our general managers focusing on the microcontroller business, one of 8-bit and one on the 32-bit. But we have another one focused on wireless. We have another one focused on the RF automotive business. We have another one focused on security. We have another one trying to combine the memory businesses of both the companies and they have some good memory products and we think we could do more and better with them. So I can't afford to ignore one-third of any business and....","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","No. I understand it. I'm just doing the math in terms of sensitivity. Every 250 basis points change in the microcontroller business has 180 basis point impact on revenue growth. And as you do \u2013 the same number, in terms of the one-third of the business only have 80 basis points. So that's what I'm just trying to get a sense of your thought process there?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So the business has been declining so far with the March quarter as the bottom. And what we're trying to do is first to stabilize it here, recover from the distribution inventory issue in the second half, grow some, and then lots of good design wins are in the works.","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","The products and technologies are fundamentally good. and so we believe that a good foundation from which to begin the efforts needed to grow the business. There's every confidence that as we take those products, apply some of the disciplines that Steve talked, about get them into a combined channel, there's no doubt in my mind we'll find ways to grow that business.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about the CapEx, your plans. It seems it's extremely low as a percentage of revenue. Is that just good timing or you expect that to expand in coming years or \u2013 and what is the CapEx (54:26)","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess I'd say we have the factory footprint that we need and we'll make incremental investments in the business as required. You'll probably recall that for Microchip's core business that we've pretty high CapEx in the first two quarters of last fiscal year, and with that we put some capacity in place that really isn't being utilized today. So we've got some capacity to grow into on that front. We still have a lot of work to do in determining how backend integration is going to work for Atmel. We've got some placeholders for that, but we think a $140 million is a good placeholder for the current fiscal year, and as we learn more about future investment needs we can update you on that.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Atmel revenue is down much more substantially. I mean our revenue is close to \u2013 it was record last quarter, but Atmel's revenue is down significantly from its higher numbers before. Earlier caller mentioned that 17% drop last year. So there is substantial space in their factories. So therefore, I think the capital investment should be relatively limited for growing the revenue going forward.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping I could better understand some of the dynamics around the Atmel revenue. And there was some discussion in some of the online publications around some of the larger customers potentially taking business away from Atmel post merger. And I was hoping you could clarify if any of the decline in Atmel's revenue is some of these larger customers may be taking business elsewhere.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think I mentioned that Atmel had a very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have found businesses in Atmel, particular line items to particular customers, that were at negative gross margins where you're wrapping money around every part that you're shipping, and some of that happening even on non-commodity products, even microcontrollers. I mean, why would you do that? So I think as we try to correct those things \u2013 I put the brand in three different categories, three different positioning, and let me take that angle from a marketing standpoint.","A company has a brand position which is really what do the customers think of the company. Then a company has a product position, positioning where \u2013 what does the customer think of the company's products. And then the third, a company has a pricing position where what do the customers think of the value the company provides to the customers on its products. So positioning is important three different ways: brand positioning, product positioning, and pricing positioning.","When I look at Microchip, I find us very strong in all three. We have a good brand reputation, we have a good product positioning, and we have good pricing positioning where we're able to draw very, very good pricing by customers seeing the value in our products. That's how we make near 60% gross margin. When I apply the same principles to Atmel, I find they have a good product positioning. And Ganesh and I mentioned that we find good products. The company probably has just an okay brand position as a company but it has a very poor pricing positioning, where it hasn't positioned its products to be able to show the value to the customer. And they sell them like...","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","Jellybeans.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Like jellybeans. So as Microchip starts to put the discipline in place and there are common customers where we do business with and they're same customers that Atmel does business with \u2013 and you've read something in paper where some ex-executives blabbering about and being pissed off or whatever because they no longer have a job or there cheese has been moved. But all these customers are doing business with Microchip. And they're doing business with Microchip. We're able to position our products at a much higher value, and we have substantially higher gross margin at the same customers where Atmel has a very poor gross margin.","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, we had no large customers that are designing out because of this in any way.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer","If anything, it's a converse. We have more conversations with large customers recognizing that the combined companies, Microchip and Atmel, to them represent a much more strategic supplier to them and wanting to have more discussions in that direction.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Then on the top of that the sales force is commissioned. Atmel's sales force is commissioned. Microchip is not. And we have had conversations with sales people where we say, this is a negative gross margin business. Why do you do that? Well, I'm making commission on it. You can't take it away. So as you start to interrupt that environment and start to change that culture, you will get reaction from those people. And then somebody talks to the press. That's what you have read. We are doing what our investors would want us to do, is to have three better positioning, brand, products, and pricing.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","This is very helpful. And there's a couple of just very quick clarifications around Atmel. Could you clarify what sell-in revenue is next quarter? I think the $225 million to $245 million is sell-through. And then one other clarification, I think you mentioned $14 million is excluded from revenue from Atmel around the Mobile Touch. And I thought last quarter it was maybe $6 million to $7 million. And maybe just help me reconcile those two figures. Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So $6 million to $7 million is based on sell-in and the inventory was very, very high. The sell-thorough was $14 million, or around $14 million. So that's the difference on your second question. Regarding what is the sell-in revenue this quarter, we don't care. We really don't care. We are not going to stop the channel. We are not going to make any deals; that's another thing Atmel did. They basically made deals at the end of the quarter at lower prices and make deals with the distribution to give whatever so that \u2013 given revenue could be reported. We do not care about the sell-in. We never cared about sell-in on the Microchip side. We are going to work with the distributors to create demand and sell business to end customers at better prices and whatever distributors want to stock, we don't care about sell-in.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","Next question comes from Gil Alexandre with Darfil Associates (01:01:31).","Unknown Speaker","My question has been answered. Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. The first one is a clarification I think. If I wanted to compare like apples-to-apples on revenues going forward, the Touch business comes out of the top line. Did you say this 32-bit PIC business comes out of the top line and the Atmel Wireless comes out of the top line going forward? And then aggregate about \u2013 could you share with us what that was in the previous quarter?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, I don't know how you got all that. The only thing that comes out of the top line is the mobile piece of the Touch business. We're dividing the Touch business into two portions, the automotive and industrial on one side, which we're keeping, and the Mobile Touch on the other side, which we're not keeping, which last quarter was $7 million on sell-in, about $14 million on sell-through. That's the only thing that's coming out. Nothing else is coming from the top line. I don't know how you got wireless.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So the PIC microprocessor that Ganesh mentioned earlier, that was a project that was in development at Microchip. That was not producing revenue.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so it was a brand-new initiative at Microchip. In addition to our 32-bit PIC microcontroller line we were going to develop a PIC microprocessor line, which is with their higher end cores, they don't have Flash, it goes in a different market, they use Linux operating systems. It was a very, very large investment, and Atmel has already made that investment and had significant revenue on it. So we're not going to make those investments on our sides. But there was zero revenue. There was not even a revenue on it in the next year. And then nothing comes out of the wireless. Atmel ran a very, very small wireless business out of seven different design centers and we closed one of them, which was in Germany, in a very high cost region.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we continue to sell those products and market those products. There was a very small revenue coming out of that center. So there's nothing else; it's only the Mobile Touch.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Understood that. Thanks for clarifying. And then I imagine there will be a restructuring charge in the June quarter. Is there a way to estimate that or give us a sense to how big that might be?","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't have it. We are not giving to give you a number and then want to be limited in any way to really live to that number. So restructuring charge will be whatever it will be.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management for closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.

This resulted in earnings of $0.61 per diluted share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58.6% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.8 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $165.8 million or 34.4% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $21.8 million, share-based compensation of $11.9 million and special charges of $0.8 million.","The GAAP net income was $105.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $6.2 million and a onetime gain of $2.4 million on our acquisition of EqcoLogic, for which GAAP accounting required us to write up our previous ownership of 18.3% to its fair value. Ganesh will discuss the EqcoLogic acquisition later on this call.","In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax rate was 6.4%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $6.2 million of nonrecurring favorable tax events I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items.","Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%.","To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.103, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.028, the onetime gain on the EqcoLogic acquisition was about $0.011 and noncash interest expense was about $0.007.","The dividend declared today of $0.355 per share will be paid on March 7, 2014 to shareholders of record on February 24 -- excuse me, February 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $70.7 million.","This quarter's dividend will be our 46th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 48th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividend paid is approaching $2.2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014 was $274.6 million or 126 days. We expect days of inventory at the end of March to be down between 1 and 7 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors stayed flat in the December quarter at 33 days and remain at low levels compared to where they have been historically.","I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At December 31, the accounts receivable balance was $224.3 million, and decreased by $6.2 million on a sequential basis. Receivable balances remain in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Free cash flow generation in the December quarter was $110.3 million prior to our dividend payment.","As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.03 billion, and we had $650 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit.","Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $135 million to $155 million in the March quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $24.3 million for the December quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2014 to be about $115 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that were outsourced by SMSC.","Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $22.2 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers.","Our overall microcontroller revenue declined 2.4% sequentially in the December quarter. However, microcontroller revenue was up 17.8% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a year of excellent market share gain in calendar 2013. Microcontrollers represented 65% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","As we projected, during our last quarter's conference call, we shipped a 13 billionth cumulative microcontroller in November, just 7 months after we shipped our 12 billionth microcontroller back in April.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was down 2.7% sequentially in the December quarter. However, 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 27.9% over the year-ago quarter as we gained significant market share in calendar 2013. This business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us, and we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business was down 0.8% sequentially in the December quarter. However, 32-bit microcontroller revenue was up 29.5% over the year-ago quarter as, once again, we gain substantial market share in this segment.","During the December quarter, we had 2 blockbuster announcements. First, the feature-rich, PIC32MZ family of products, which have the highest computational performance of any microcontroller in the category, as well as the best software efficiency.","And second, the MPLAB Harmony integrated software platform, the industry's first software framework to integrate both internal and third-party middleware drivers, peripheral libraries and real-time operating systems. That's simplifying and accelerating the 32-bit software development process, which is one of the larger challenges customers face.","Both these solutions have received broad industry accolades and customer acceptance. We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs and expand into new fields of play like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Our overall microcontroller results, as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results, are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. We're gaining significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now moving to our analog business. Our analog business bucked the trend and grew 0.4% sequentially in the December quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth to achieve a new record, and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting significant market share gains.","Analog revenue represented 22.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. And we continue to have one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry.","In November, we announced the acquisition of EqcoLogic, a Brussels-based early stage company, who has innovative equalizer and coax transceiver products and technologies, which are important to our automotive and other embedded networking initiatives.","EqcoLogic's leadership equalizer technology enables the effective recovery of high-speed signals that may degrade as they transmit over longer distances. In an automotive infotainment network, for example, this technology enables substantial system-level cost reduction as OEMs can switch from expensive optical fiber networks to much more cost-effective coaxial cable networks, even though the signals degrade more in a coax cable network as compared to an optical fiber network.","Last but not least, in our core analog business, we are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Now moving to our memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was sequentially down 7.1%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014.","We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. All of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were at\/or better than the midpoint of our guidance.","Our operating profit percentage is approaching 32% and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of the guidance by $0.01 per share.","Our overall net sales in December quarter were up 16% versus the year-ago quarter, marking an excellent year of market share growth compared to a low single-digit growth for the industry. Our analog business made a new all-time record in December quarter, with sales up 0.4% sequentially and up 16.7% over the year-ago quarter. All other major segments of the business was sequentially down a bit based on the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. The end of December quarter also marks the completion of the 2013 calendar year, which was an excellent year for Microchip in every respect.","Last but not the least, the December quarter was our 93rd consecutive profitable quarter.","I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding year for Microchip.","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014. The March quarter is seasonally a middle-of-the-road quarter for Microchip, not as strong as June and September, but not sequentially down as December. It does not feel any different this year, and we expect this to be a seasonally normal quarter. Europe is normally very strong in this quarter, America is in the middle and Asia is down due to lunar new year holidays. Taking all of this into account, we expect the March quarter net sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59% and 59.2% of sales, which is a slight improvement from December quarter. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.8% and 27.2% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.8% and 32.4% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.59 and $0.63 per share.","Our EPS is getting a slight negative impact by the addition of about 3 million shares through the share count. This is because of significantly higher average stock price in the current quarter versus the last quarter, the rising stock price mix of our $1.15 billion convertible transaction more in the money and results into a higher effective share count.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory writeup on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp.","With this, operator, will you please pull for questions? Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering, in the automotive market, there's been talk of Ethernet coming into the automobile. Are you seeing that trend and are you preparing for that?","Ganesh Moorthy","So there are many standards that come into the automotive marketplace. In automotive networking for infotainment, the MOST network is the dominant standard today. There are, obviously, alternates in any given market. Ethernet is one of them. That is in consideration. But we believe we have a strong position in the marketplace and a position that customers have validated with their choice of our network.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just talk a little bit more about automotive. Are there many opportunities for 32-bit microcontrollers? And what's your traction there?","Ganesh Moorthy","So the answer is yes. There are many 32-bit applications in automotive. As you know, we have been on the journey for 32-bit for not as many years as some of the incumbents who play in that space. But we are starting to make inroads in 32-bit applications in carmakers just as we have previously with our 16-bit, as well as our 8-bit along the way. So we fully expect as time goes on, you'll see that our microcontrollers across the spectrum of 8s, 16s and 32s will play in many automotive applications.","Steve Sanghi","I'd like to add to that. When you come up with a brand new product line, whether it's 8, 16 and 32, if the first 2 products you make are for the automotive market, which means they have all the CAN bus, the LIN bus and all the protocols and everything that the automotive needs, then your first revenue is 3 or 4 years away. And that's not the best way to launch a brand new product line. So just like we did that with 8 or 16, we originally come up with a product line that will be quicker time-to-market in other applications, industrial, consumer and all the others. And then as the product line gains momentum and the architecture is accepted, we have round out all -- any other issues, any of the others, then you add the automotive features and start to work with automotive. So that began 3 years ago or so. And now we have designs in automotive and we're moving, but the large portion of the revenue is not automotive yet.","Operator","We'll move next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","Could you remind me of what are your growth margin goals, long-term model?","Steve Sanghi","So our long-term model for those margin is 61.5%, plus\/minus 0.5%. And we are certainly making progress. The middle point of the guidance for us in the current quarter is 59.1%. So we're reaching towards it and continue to make fairly good progress.","Operator","Moving on to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You noted the strong growth in 16 and 32-bit year-over-year. Can you provide any color or context from new product introductions, what you're doing on those product lines and anything from a design win perspective?","James Eric Bjornholt","So in any given year, we have anywhere from 100 to 125 brand-new products that we bring to market. A substantial portion of that continues to be 16-bit and 32-bit because our portfolio there was not as rich as we did on the 8-bit. I don't have the exact numbers, but we're well over 100 products at this point on our 32-bit. And we're well above 400 products in our 16-bit portfolio.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And as a follow-up, on the SMSC transaction, you guys saw a very strong margin expansion early on. Can you talk about just the revenue synergies and opportunities that you see over the next 12 to 18 months on that side?","Ganesh Moorthy","The revenue synergies are building over the last year. We have spent time in looking at how our customers' application boards where Microchip, prior to SMSC, did not play, but SMSC customers could use our products and how that could be brought to bear on new designs, and likewise where SMSC products could be brought into the Microchip customer base. So it is a -- these are long-design cycles. They take 18, 24 months to get to the point where they get to revenue. There are many the pipeline. Some of the early ones have gone to production. But we're very optimistic in terms of how the 2 product lines combined play a stronger role at many end customers than what each of us individually could have played.","Steve Sanghi","I mentioned this in the last conference call in November, I believe, that I spent a week with all of our Asian distributors, collected them all in 1 geography and nearly 80 or 90 of them and reviewed the last calendar year and had them -- put some plans together for the current calendar year. And it was quite surprising to see that Microchip's distribution, which was not SMSC distribution before, how much cross-selling opportunity they had identified on SMSC products into the Microchip customer base. There was, in fact, the highlight of the conference that just very, very significant opportunity they have identified in all of our consumer industrial accounts with USB and Ethernet and all of the other SMSC products. So they will take some time to go to production, but the opportunity is significant.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move back to Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry about the difficulty before. Steve, I was just wondering if you could address again your new longer -- new higher longer-term margin model. It seems like the biggest place where you have to improve to get there is in the gross margin line. Can you talk about some of the utilization or cost structure measures in the cost of goods sold or mix and what the timeframe would be to kind of hope you to get to -- up to that 51.5% model?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I can lead you there qualitatively, but not really quantitatively breaking down the impact of each of the other things. So some of the qualitative factors are obviously fab utilization. Our internal fabs are not at the capacity they were yet at the peak for a number of reasons. As the couple of years go by, some of the technology migration happens and we're producing parts at a better nodes. So therefore, it just produces a large number of die in a wafer and therefore, cutting the number of wafers. Some of the products are made in outside foundries, where it was more either cost-effective or more feasible or we didn't have the technology inside. So for a number of reasons, we're not at that full capacity. So there's a significant accretion still coming as that goes towards a peak production. The acquisitions are not 100% integrated. We are far into it. But if you look at both from an assembly and test perspective and the wafer pro perspective, we're still moving a lot of the SMSC products into Microchip. And if we're to guess what portion of the test is converted?","Ganesh Moorthy","Probably about 20%, 25%.","Steve Sanghi","25% of the test is converted. So it takes a while to get the momentum, but now we have the testers and load boards and programs. And it will rise very rapidly, but the first thing takes longer. So there's a lot of accretion coming from that also. And then there is a continuous margin improvement on our smaller product lines, which are newer in nature, where it takes a while for the products to ring out and build the next-generation products which are more cost effective and higher-yielding in our new technologies. So there are a number of things playing role in it and combination of all that gets there. I mean, we could get there on paper with a margin to give.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, in terms of the environment in Asia, you talked about that being a little bit weaker in the quarter. Maybe that's just a seasonal thing, but clearly, there's been a lot of concern whether that's real or not real about China in the emerging markets. China PMI was down a little bit. Can you talk about just the overall order environment and what your customers are telling you out of Asia, and what you're seeing from Asian distributors in particular?","Steve Sanghi","Well, Asia goes through about 10 days of holidays and driven by that in the current quarter forecast. So Asia is down just about as much as it historically is just by the number of days they're off. So that's why we called the quarter pretty seasonally normal. Booking patterns are normal. There's really nothing abnormal to call. There's not any kind of crisis or disaster in the works. Our products are also very ubiquitous, though. They go into areas where as Chinese are building more and more consumerism, a lot of them, they acquire these products where our products are in. We're in the things and people buy a things.","Operator","We'll now hear from Susquehanna Financial Group's Chris Caso.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a question about production levels. And I think last quarter you suggested the plan was to keep production fairly constant as you went through this quarter, and your comments suggested that the inventory levels internally come down as a result of that. If you hit those inventory targets by the end of this quarter, should we expect the production levels to start increasing as we go into the June quarter? And if you could give some sense of the effect of that on gross margins.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think it depends on where we are within the guidance, which is really narrow, flat to up 3%. We have not put together a plan. And we're in the middle of our annual operating planning process. Our fiscal year ends at the end of the current quarter. So we don't really have an official fiscal 2015 plan yet to really see what production we'll be running. But if we grow production, that will improve gross margin. The inventory is not exactly where I want it to be. I think it needs more improvement. We'll get some this quarter whether we need some more next quarter or we could completely improve production. We don't know yet. It depends on where it will land. Do you have something to add?","James Eric Bjornholt","No. I was going to say there's ongoing gross margin improvement from the back end from assembly and test as we bring more of that in-house as well.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So you may get some gross margin improvement from the back end, but the front end is obviously dependent on the revenue levels and where the inventory goes?","James Eric Bjornholt","That's right.","Steve Sanghi","We expect improvement in June quarter in gross margin, right? No question about it. Well, June quarter is generally a strong quarter for us. And there'll be higher absorption. And there should be a gross margin improvement in June quarter, no question.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And just looking out, as you say, you're in the planning process for fiscal '15. What do you expect your strategic priorities to be as you look into fiscal '15? And assuming the demand environment kind of stays stable as it is now, SMSC, the integration seems to be, I would guess, I'd characterize late innings now. Not sure how you would characterize it, but where does the management focus turn to as you go into fiscal '15?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we're not a one-trick pony. I mean, at the current quarter guidance, we're almost a $2 billion company, just slightly shy of that, around 12, 13 divisions inside the company. So continue to building out 32-bit and 16-bit and analog. And there's still a lot of new products in 8-bit. We'll continue to gain a lot of share in 8-bit as other people either can't compete or don't want it or whatever. So all the strategic product lines have a very strong roadmap, and they're all showing significant growth in the initial analysis. Then if you look at from an end market or application perspective, we're getting a very significant acceptance in growth in the Internet of Things, motor control, digital power, lighting, medical, touch, automotive. So there are just way too many. I mean, we're really -- we show a chart in the presentations. There are about 14 different segments that we have significant focus in. Now the other thing that we've been telling you for years, Microchip has one company, recognize this before many of the others in the industry that semiconductor industries has matured and saturating. And if you look at the overall semiconductor growth, they are in low single-digits year after year. We have done well. Our December quarter was up 15% year-over-year, 16%, but we also understand that there is a significant industry growth headwind that every company faces. And therefore, we also are trying to supplement Microchip's growth by a constant stream of small and some large acquisitions to bring in overall growth to a reasonable number where it will be acceptable to Microchip management and its board. So it's a combination of internal and external growth. It's not only one or the other. And we're not doing acquisitions to mask any risk of our internal growth. We're doing it to enhance on the top of the internal growth that you've seen us now for several years.","Operator","We'll now go to JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney","I have a follow-up question on the issue of the guidance for the current quarter. I'm wondering, this is the first round of a March guidance we've seen since the acquisition was fully integrated. And I'm wondering if what we're picking up here is perhaps that little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern given the different end markets that are now weighing in. And as you said, China, you're seeing probably some of your stuff go into more consumer-oriented products. So some of the last 10 years, the data and throughout the 2 that were real outliers, you typically saw around 3% to 3.5% growth in the March quarter. So can you -- do you have a sense of this whether you're seeing basically a little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern because of the different end market mix than before the acquisition?","Steve Sanghi","Well, JoAnne, you are always very astute and smart in your analysis. And I think you have answered your question. There are 2 shifts in that seasonality, minor ones, but they're definitely worth noting. One is that with the acquisitions and all that, we have little more of our business now in the computing segment, which kind of sees a significant decline in the calendar first quarter than we had in the Microchip's core business. So there's a little impact of that. The second impact is Asia is becoming a larger and larger portion of our business. I mean, China is a huge portion of our business now. We break those out in the Qs. You can read them. So as that becomes larger and larger portion of the business, then you have a larger portion of overall Microchip that takes a drop in the calendar first quarter because of the Chinese New Year. And if there's enough shift in the business in Asia and that starts to be material. So I think those combined two things together, this is probably the new normal, but it probably also mean that you'll pick up that gap on other quarters which are either stronger quarters for Asia or they're stronger quarters for SMSC business. So overall, it hasn't shifted, but there's a slight impact in the calendar first quarter because of those 2 reasons.","JoAnne Feeney","All right, okay, perfect. And then as a follow up, just looking longer term at your opportunities for continued share gain, it's been quite impressive in 16-bit and 32-bit. But one might expect that, that would naturally slow down as you kind of tick off the low-hanging fruit. So I guess, could you give us some sense of what you expect over the next year or so and how you expect, if you do, to continue to gain share and what you think the pace of that will be, that is the growth of those 2 segments relative to the industry?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the current estimates aren't saying that it kind of slows down. If it does, that's really minor in nature. But then you pick up the difference by newer applications where we can now do a very good job where maybe historically, we could not with the high-performance 16 and 32-bit product lines like digital power, like the lighting, like the Internet of Things, Wi-Fi connectivity and all that kind of stuff. So we are opening additional, large amount of served available market. I mean, if you look at the Internet of Things, our revenue in Internet of Things is hundreds of millions of dollars. If you look at the overall definition of what some of the others are calling as overall Internet connectivity or machine-to-machine connectivity, and it's the fastest-growing segment of the business. So there are always pluses and minuses and something saturates, but then the new opportunities emerge, and how well positioned you are. You want to talk about IoT a little bit?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes. I think as Steve mentioned, this is one of the exciting areas of opportunity presented to us. And the broad adoption of tablets and smartphones are one of the catalysts that are accelerating the demand for more things to be connected and accessible by these mobile devices. And we've historically had a very strong presence in a broad range of things that are in our home and in some of our other areas where we interact. And we think we have a pole position on -- as these things get connected, our solutions being in the center of how they are connected. Therefore, things that we know, 4 areas that we have to bring to bear to win in the Internet of Things market. One is a strong portfolio of microcontrollers and analog, which we have and we're continuing to strengthen. Two is a strong portfolio of wireless and wired connectivity. Three is a suite of the software and firmware requirement for the different protocol and security that is going to be required any time you have connectivity. And finally, the fourth is a set of partners who can provide both cost-effective and scalable cloud infrastructure because most of them are really not IT experts, nor have any IT infrastructure. And when you put it all together, it's epicenter of where we have played. We have customers that we know very well, and we have technologies to enable them. And we are seeing many, many of them taking advantage of that capability.","JoAnne Feeney","So it sounds like you're looking at some adjacent sockets in products where you're already appearing, in dishwashers and other white goods, for example?","Steve Sanghi","Yes. So we are in things and now we are helping customers connect those things. So selling additional content, whether it's a wireless module or an RF module are really getting them, helping them do more things. And then continuing with the answer to your question, we talked about all the cross-selling opportunities with SMSC products into our socket. So think about how many cars today have a USB charger socket in the car. Every time I do an analysis, if there are 10 people I'm talking to, and I ask a question, the number comes out to be about 20% and 30%. In 20%, 30% of the cars, people have a USB charger. You can always charge for the cigarette lighter, but I'm talking about the actual USB charger. And now fast forward 3 or 4 years, don't you think all -- 100% of the cars will have a USB charger because that's what's becoming the life. And who is getting in all these cars, whose USB chargers are in most of the cars? It's yours truly. So there are always areas which are growing significantly faster where there's a significant opportunity. When you look at the USB -- so we have proprietary technology where you plug in a smartphone into the USB charger of the car and a phone can become the host. And whatever you have on the phone, it will display that whether it's navigation or whatever on the screen of the car, which could be extremely beneficial. Everybody uses navigation on their phone as they travel or get rental cars, everybody uses the phone. I know how to use it in my phone. I don't even know how to use it in my car. Next time, I'm going to get one in the car because I have it in the phone. And you plug it to the USB charger, and it displays what you're running on your phone on your car. So -- and we were showing that at the CES show in Las Vegas, an actual demo of that working. So there are tremendous opportunities coming up with this connectivity. And we're right in the thicket of it. And there are lots of design wins, there are lots of opportunities. So those things will grow faster. And some of the mature businesses could slow down a little bit, but the overall opportunity has not decreased.","Operator","We'll go now to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A question for Ganesh. Ganesh, congratulations. Steve and Ganesh, congratulations on pretty impressive microcontroller growth as a category. I was wondering if you could provide some color on maybe between 8, 16 and 32, which one you think you took the most share in? If you want to rank, order them or just talk qualitatively, I would appreciate the color.","Steve Sanghi","I think if you want to look at the dollars, we took the most share in 8-bit, didn't we?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, in overall dollars because that's the rank order of the revenue is 8-bit, the largest business, followed by 16, followed by 32. But if you look at the growth rates, you're going to find that compared to where the baseline grew, 16 and 32-bit is where we grew, outgrew, and 8-bit will have outgrown, but by not quite the same magnitude. So it's hard -- we'll know in 2 or 3 months when all the official numbers will be put together. But I'm expecting we'll see large gains across 8, 16 and 32.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough, guys. That's helpful. And I wanted to ask you, in your press release, Steve you talked about the MPLAB Harmony integrated software platform. I was struggling to understand how that will work in terms of you being able to sell chips. Maybe you could take up a couple of minutes to explain how that flows through in your P&L?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so the most difficult thing for the customer in a 32-bit is development of the software and the firmware. And if you have a piecemeal solution where the chip comes from one party, the stack comes from another party, the library comes from another party, the development will come from somebody else, and then you have to put all those things together, then you don't have a very good experience because when something isn't working, you don't know whether it's architecture or the chip, or the software or the development tool or whatever. So what Microchip has done is the entire PIC32 solution comes from Microchip, but it's much more like an Apple kind of experience where the product, the architecture, the software, the development tool, the libraries, the stacks, everything is coming from Microchip and already crosschecked and functional. So what we have done on the top of that now with the Harmony software is really integrated the entire ecosystem. We also integrated the third-party software, the middleware, the stacks and everything all pre-checked out. And customers are telling us, it's up to 40%, 50% productivity. And this development of the software is about 75% of the total cost in adopting a 32-bit microcontroller into an end application. And on that 75% of the cost, if you can provide that much productivity on an industry, accolades are coming like crazy. So how we essentially monetize this, winning more designs, accelerating time-to-market, selling more 32-bit chips. And then in all the software and all that, you always have a version of it which is free essentially. Anybody can use it. So there's a wide acceptance of it. But then you have premium versions and you have software support and upgrades and all that for which you charge, it becomes a product. But that's not where the big money is. Big money is really still selling that chip.","Operator","And next from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we'll hear from John Pitzer.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I apologize, I've been jumping back and forth across a couple of calls, Steve. So if you addressed this, I do apologize. But it's been my perception that the environment over the last couple of quarters has sort of given you guys perhaps a little bit more visibility than sort of normal. And I'm kind of curious, notwithstanding kind of the seasonal issues in the March quarter, as you think about lead times and just the rate at which customers are placing orders, how would you kind of characterize visibility today? And I guess as you answer the question, Steve, you've always had a better view than most on the economy and the macro. And I'm kind of curious, as you think about 2014, is the macro a tailwind, a headwind or a neutral factor as we think about your growth?","Steve Sanghi","The best guess would be neutral.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just relative to visibility today versus, let's say, 30 days ago, how are you guys seeing kind of customer activity in order? Is it just tracking around normal seasonality, and so we really have to wait until after Chinese New Year to have a better assessment?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, it hasn't changed. Basically, there's a lot of positioning and jockeying for position for the Chinese New Year. And even for December, some people have year-end in December. They're trying to lower the inventories. Some distributors have a fiscal year ending at some other times. So they kind of adjust the inventory a different time. Some people want the product before the Chinese New Year, so they can participate in the surge afterwards. And some place the order, but they want to take their delivery after. So there are all these crosscurrents, and it's kind of -- I think the good thing is Chinese New Year is early. I mean, it's beginning now. And 2 months of the quarter are left after that. And usually, every time that happens, where the Chinese New Year is early, usually has been a positive result.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Steve, as my follow-up, at our conference in December, you gave a pretty informative presentation about the positioning of 32-bit and kind of what you're doing at the software level on the ecosystem. And correct me if I'm wrong, but the argument sort of was you're kind of hitting an inflection point or a critical mass point where 32 might actually start to show even more meaningful gains in the strong growth you're seeing. Is that how I should think about the 32 big growth prospects for 2014? And I also noticed in the quarter you announced an ARM-based microcontroller. Should I just think about that as another arrow in your quiver or is there something more strategic behind that?","Steve Sanghi","So several questions in there. Number one, yes, the point I made on 32-bit is we went over 100 products last quarter. And 100 products is kind of the magical critical mass. If you have fewer products in a microcontroller, then you have engagement issues with our customer, where the customer engages, he does all this work and says, \"I like the architecture. I'll use your product.\" But then they need more memory or the connectivity, they need a LIN bus, they need a Wi-Fi, they need an RF on the chip, and you don't have that version of the product, then their work is wasted and they have to go through the different architectures. So customers often look for having a sufficient critical mass of products where there's a very high probability that the product they need is in the portfolio, and at 100-plus products that becomes really real. So we really, we hit that number. So we think that's a reasonable inflection point. And the second is the 2 main things that I talked about at your conference, and Ganesh talked about it today. One is the announcement of the 32-bit and 32 MZ product line, which is really industry's the highest performance microcontroller in its class. And second is this Harmony software development tool, which is absolutely a productivity giver to the customers. So we think all those things combined is really a game-changer. And we're starting to see it in the feedback we're getting.","Operator","We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on a different product segment, the analog product group. The business has performed very well in the last year. And how should we think about the way you're looking at growing that business as we think about calendar '14 and beyond, whether it be from a product group standpoint. Where do you feel like you can add products or whether it be just from taking that product to market, whether it be channel management strategies, what have you?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so we have described over the years where we had a three-pronged strategy in analog. Early on at the start of the century, our analog strategy was largely attaching analog to our own microcontrollers for the first few years because we had no name recognition in analog, we didn't know Microchip makes analog. So we had a great name recognition in microcontrollers, so we will position and attach RPMs and supervisors and power management and those kind of products together with our microcontroller sockets. And at one point at the peak, well over 70% of our analog business was attached to our microcontroller. But that strategy was quite successful. Then we went into the Phase 2 where we said, \"Well, our analog products are so well designed and architected to work in a microcontroller-embedded control environment. Why would we limit ourself to only Microchip's microcontrollers.\" Back then, we had 4%, 5% market share in microcontroller overall because we didn't even make 16 and 32 at that time. 8-bit, why we would not position this to any microcontroller, whether it's Freescale or NXP or Atmel or ST or anybody else? We don't win the microcontroller, but we still compete for the analog because our architecture is very well to work next to those designs. So that was the Phase 2 of that strategy, and they were very successful a few years ago. It accelerated our growth rate on analog. And then, in the last few years, we said, Phase 3. Why would we now limited only to the microcontroller sockets? What about FPGA? What about DSP? What about SoCs, silicon on chip? Or really any kind of sockets. And that put us in a direct competition with TI, ADI, Linear, Maxim, some of the big companies. And we have, what, over 2,000 products in analog now?","Ganesh Moorthy","About 1,100 to 1,200.","Steve Sanghi","1,100, 1,200 analog products. So broad portfolio and positioning it really head-on with in any kind of sockets. And it has worked very well. And we're growing. We have the best performance of analog in the industry compared to -- look at the year-over-year growth rates compared to anybody.","Ganesh Moorthy","And it's not just the last year, right? If you go back and look at it, it's now been for several years we've seen that analog has performed exceptionally well and outgrown the analog industry and the semiconductor industry both.","Steve Sanghi","And people have some sort of this mix that analog is black magic, and all the analog engineers work for these other companies and you can't find them and that's just kind of not true. We were able to attract them. We had lots of analog engineers working in our microcontroller groups because 95% of the microcontroller revenue is with the large amount of analog on the same die. And we were able to package some of that functionality standalone, some of it together with the microcontroller. But really, we were able to amass a fair amount of these sources, some through acquisitions, some ourselves, and then created one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Well, I was going to summarize it by saying it seems like what you're saying is the recipe for growth is to continue to execute on the strategy that you have in place. As I look back at some of your past comments, I think it was 2 quarters ago, maybe it was even 3, where you said based on the successful completion of the SMSC deal, you were ready to do another mid-sized deal. Subsequent to that, there hasn't been such a deal. Is the issue that there aren't good targets out there, is the issue that there are good targets, but that with the market going so much higher that the valuations aren't where you'd be comfortable, where do you stand with respect to growing through acquisition at this point?","Steve Sanghi","So like I said early on, I don't know whether you were on the call yet or not, but I mentioned in fiscal 2015 and then going forward, we continue to have a strategy of significant internal growth and then further beefed up by continuous small or occasionally large acquisition. Beyond that, I couldn't really give you any signal for timing or what area or whatever. But it's like we're active constantly.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to see if you could give a few comments around the licensing business? Do you have more contracts on the way? And how does licensing play into the Internet of Things?","Steve Sanghi","So the only way licensing plays in the Internet of Things is really enabling our SuperFlash technology to build low-power microcontrollers in the industry, which will then go to the Internet of Things. Otherwise, it doesn't really have a direct play. What we have successfully done is really essentially licensed to every major foundry is licensed on a SuperFlash technology. The largest big foundries, any other foundry you name, the one in Taiwan, the one in China, the ones in Singapore, the ones in Malaysia, the ones in Europe, they all have license of SuperFlash technology. And some are in production and some are proceeding towards the production where the licensing happened either last year or the year before. And these are very complex technologies. It takes a couple of years to go to production. So there's a significant additional revenue growth ahead as these additional foundries go to production and the royalty income begin. We have more than doubled the business since we bought SST. When we bought it, it was doing $40 million a year business. We're doing about $90 million now. And there's further growth ahead as many more of these foundries go to production.","Operator","And gentlemen, at this time, we'll turn the conference back to you all for closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Well, thanks for attending the conference. Our next conference we go to is...","James Eric Bjornholt","We're presenting at Stifel Conference on February 11.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. So we'll see some of you there. Otherwise, we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","And that will conclude today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.","Stephen Sanghi","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","As you know, in addition to earnings, we also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Micrel. During this conference call, we will not cover anything in relations to the acquisition and we'll take your questions only related to the earning. After we conclude this conference call, you will have to dial in to the second conference call where we will cover matters related to the acquisition and take your questions. The second conference call has to be filed with the SEC, hence the separation of 2 conference calls. The second call will begin at 5:45 p.m. Eastern Time.","With that, let me now pass this call to our Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt.","James Eric Bjornholt","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call.","I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance.","For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share.","GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.","Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010.","GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves.","For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share.","In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.","The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.9 billion.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.","The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors.","Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers.","Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas.","In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years.","In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now, Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well.","Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth.","Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue.","By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems.","Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products.","So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Stephen Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.","We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions.","Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.","In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February.","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share.","Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.","Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time, at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve, the guidance, a couple percentage points below consensus and perhaps normal seasonal patterns. Understanding that that's not out of line with what other companies are guiding this season as well, I wonder if you can comment on whether you see that small weakness extending further in the next quarter. You often have some strong opinions on the cycle and we -- I think we'd like to hear them.","Stephen Sanghi","I have blocked my opinion on the cycle. I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft, just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I understand that. If I can ask 1 follow-up, please. Wonder to what degree do you see this -- the weakness as FX related, either sort of first order or second order effect and whether there are any end markets, you were good enough to call out IoT. I think historically you haven't done a lot of talking about specific end markets. But is there 1 particular end market like either PC or wireless infrastructure that may be weaker or stronger?","Stephen Sanghi","So we don't really have much end market commentary. We serve 90,000-plus customers and a vast majority of them through distribution and many time, at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there.","James Eric Bjornholt","I think the question was on FX.","Stephen Sanghi","FX, I don't really think we can delineate the effects that much. But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries and I don't think we can decipher that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","The first question is along the lines of currency also, but I noted that your business in Europe appear to be very strong in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk about that a bit. I didn't know if perhaps there were some currency related effects in there, perhaps having an effect on customer demand in the quarter. I guess, was that European strength surprising to you? And just generally, what would you think may be behind that?","Stephen Sanghi","Go ahead, Eric.","James Eric Bjornholt","So Chris, if you look back at our historical results, the March quarter is always a strong period in Europe and you're having growth of almost 19%. It was a really good quarter in Europe, but that's not out of the line with what we've seen historically. And so with the FX rates really changing kind of late 2014, early 2015, the impact on the quarter, from an FX standpoint, was not significant in the March quarter and Steve talked about what the forward effects could be. But it's always a very strong quarter in March in Europe and this quarter was no different.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. Just as a follow-up, I know you're trying to take inventory levels up. If you can remind us kind of where you're looking to take them, how long you think it's going to take to get there. And is there sort of a leverage benefit on margins as you do that?","Stephen Sanghi","I think we like our inventory. Product mix has gotten very complex. Today, a significant portion of our business is analog. Lots of our microcontrollers business is very analog-like. There's a high amount of analog on microcontrollers with lots and lots of SKUs. So we're basically finding that our inventory level needs to be between 115 and 120 days. A few years ago, we used to talk about 110 days. So I think it's gone up by about maybe 7 to 10 days to have a reasonable amount of inventory to be able to do business in such a complex mix of SKUs, and our inventory today is 111 days.","James Eric Bjornholt","111 and we put in the release that we'd expect, based on the guidance for the quarter, for inventory to grow between 3 and 9 days. So take the middle of the road of that and we're kind of getting real close to what our model is for the longer term. So I think inventory is in pretty good shape.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to follow up on the current environment given that the quarter itself came in line. Can you just talk about maybe how it progressed? And it looks like within the last 6 months, we've had a couple times a bit of a pause here. Just what you make of that from a demand or inventory perspective?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, in terms of how the quarter progressed, it was a very standard March quarter that starts slow with the new year holidays around the world then picks up some steam and then slows down into the Chinese New Year and then you have a [indiscernible] in March. It's probably the most back-end loaded quarter we do compared to June quarter, September quarter, December quarter. March quarter is the most back-end loaded, predominantly driven by the Chinese New Year and slow start in January, so very difficult.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, and I'd say that was within our expectations.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Any then -- any color in terms of just kind of canvassing the landscape from a demand and just some of the sluggish trends you're seeing out there?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I hate to go back and visit last year, but late last year, the estimates for the industry were double-digit 10 percentile [ph]. And we were able to see that, that that's not doable. It just didn't look possible with what we were seeing in the PC, the inventory we were seeing in the channel and what we were hearing from our customers. We just didn't think the industry had a driver to really create another 10% growth year. And as you look at it now, the growth rate for the industry has been cut in half. So I really have to say that I'm not surprised. It's -- I think that's what we thought it will be.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a longer-term question. If you look across, you've been successful in really ramping the analog business as well as on the MCU side in terms of share gains over time. But just as you look at those 2 businesses, any differences for long-term growth rates in terms of which one you might think grow the fastest longer term?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, we're a very profitable company. As you can see, 32.3% operating profit. So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well-funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1\/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower. There are much, much larger analog companies that we can take share from for long time.","Operator","We'll continue on to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","On your CapEx plan for fiscal year '16, you said $160 million. Can you break it down a little bit? Is it front end or back end and just where the spending will be?","James Eric Bjornholt","So it's a combination of both, Kevin. We're continuing to invest in new processes and kind of technologies in both the front end and back end and investing to not only support the growth of our organic business, but then invest to bring some things in-house that were previously outsourced for acquisition. So kind of the same story that you've heard before, it is definitely a split between front-end manufacturing and back-end manufacturing.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe to add on to that, what do you expect your split to be at the end of fiscal year '16 for internal versus outsourcing?","James Eric Bjornholt","So if you're meaning how much of our wafer fab will be done in-house, so in fiscal '15, about 39% of that was outsourced and 61% was done in-house. There'll be modest movements from that in fiscal '16, won't -- nothing will change dramatically.","Stephen Sanghi","Unless there is a large acquisition that moves the mix. From an organic basis, you can move 1 or 2 points a year or something. So it's not very huge. But significant movements had happened when we acquired SST, which was 100% outsourced; when acquired SMSC, that was 100% outsourced. You could ask that question in the second conference call on Micrel and maybe I can answer it there.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Yes, maybe what I was trying to get a feel for too is like I think with SMSC, the idea was to bring the test and packaging in-house even though the wafer fab was out. Is that still the longer-term idea to do more of your own testing and packaging?","Stephen Sanghi","Yes, so when we answered your question on 39% inside, it was not on a COGS basis. It was basically on a fab basis, front end. In terms of back end, we do...","James Eric Bjornholt","88% of the test we do in-house and kind of high 50s, low 60% of assembly we do in-house and that moves around with the acquisitions as Steve noted.","Stephen Sanghi","Yes. So we have continued to bring work from SMSC inside. We have closed Supertex test facility in Hong Kong. All that is running into Microchip. So yes, case-by-case basis. When it runs outside, we try to bring it inside for lower cost.","Operator","Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if there were any bright spots in terms of end markets, some markets that actually held up better both as far as March as well as maybe for the guidance.","Stephen Sanghi","I think it's fashionable to say IoT. That's what I would say probably. That's -- it grew 35% year-over-year, and I'm sure it did very well quarterly, too.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's fair. And then I think you, in response to a previous question, you had talked about linearity of the March quarter. We found that very helpful. I was wondering, not specific to this June quarter but historically, maybe you can give us an idea how typically the June quarter trends for you guys last couple of years.","Stephen Sanghi","In terms of monthly linearity?","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, just any kind of color you want to give us.","Stephen Sanghi","We'll say June quarter is probably the most linear quarter. The March quarter is the most nonlinear quarter because of the Chinese New Year. Then when you get to September quarter, you have August, which is weak usually because of holidays in Europe and parts of Asia; and December quarter, you have holidays at the end. So June quarter is actually the most normal linear quarter, and I don't think we expect anything different.","Operator","And Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess, if you just take a step back, can you compare this soft patch to what happened late last year or maybe even 2012, 2011? Do you think it's similar, better, worse? Do you think there's any chance that things could get worse? Or did we just kind of fall down a month ago or a few weeks ago and now we're kind of bouncing along the bottom and waiting for things back up? Any perspective there?","Stephen Sanghi","I think, Chris, I resigned from my industry forecasting job last year. Maybe could you...","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good luck with that. I guess, as my follow-up, how about inventory out there with distributors and your customers now that demand is a little lower? Do you expect some sort of inventory burn this quarter? Or do you feel like everybody is pretty comfortable out there?","Stephen Sanghi","So I think our distribution inventory is not high. Number one, we don't take it as a revenue, so it doesn't really matter as much. But if the distribution inventory becomes too high and then they correct it, we can have a downstream effect than if we have to lower our own inventory. Our own inventory is in the lower side and we like it higher. The distribution inventory is in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab. Manufacturing is challenging and inventory -- high inventory is not an issue right now.","Operator","And John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you mind I give my shot and try to bring you out of retirement and kind of follow up to Chris' first question? I'm just kind of curious, you're guiding flat up sequentially for the June quarter. A little bit below normal seasonal patterns, but you guys are comfortable enough to continue to build inventory. I'm just kind of curious, if you thought this was going to be prolonged or deeper, would you do anything around utilization? Would you not build inventories? The fact that you're willing to build some inventory, kind of a test inside, if you think this is more of a soft test than anything else?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I mean, we really aren't making a call either way. I mean, our manufacturing is running normal. If you look at our December quarter, we have holiday related shutdown we have to do to really do the maintenance on the facilities. So you lose a few days, and it's usually tied on total output in December quarter, and in the March quarter you get the full days. And related to that, we're working hard to build a few days of inventory. We said 3 to 9 days. Let's see at the end it comes out to be 4 or 5 days. That would still be only 114, 115 days of inventory on the lower end of 115 to 119. So like I said, in answer to Chris' question, I don't really think we have conviction either way to drive the inventory much higher and much lower. We're largely basically trying to get to the middle of our range and only going to get to the bottom of our range probably.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful, Steve. And then maybe as a follow-up, Ganesh, really appreciate the kind of the more detailed definition of IoT and you talked about a lot of the discrete IP and technology you guys provide. I'm kind of curious, to what extent you guys are providing that as a turnkey solution when you think about microcontroller, analog, wired\/wireless connectivity? How do we think about kind of -- how much of your IoT revenue is complete turnkey solutions versus discrete? And what's the opportunity to go to turnkey? And if you could talk a little bit about security within that IoT bucket as well, because clearly, there's a school of thought that secure and connected is what defines IoT. I'd be kind of curious as to how you guys thinking about the security issue?","Ganesh Moorthy","Okay. Good questions. So when we go to market, there are obviously many customers for whom we can provide the complete bag of solutions: analog, microcontroller, wireless or wired, whatever connectivity they want to have. In other cases, we may only win a portion of that, and it gives us a foothold of the customer to come back and look at their next generation of designs. So I don't have a good split of which way it is across so many different customers there are. But our obvious go-to market is doing as much as what's on the board that constitutes both the smart side of the equation as well as the connectivity side of the equation. And your question on security is a very good one as well. So we know it's a key part of many, many of these applications. We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently. So yes, any time you have a node that is connected, its security is a key part of what we need to think about in the solution we deliver.","Operator","And with no additional questions in the queue, I'd like to then turn the floor back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Stephen Sanghi","Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending our conference call. After a little break, at 5:45 Eastern Time, we'll be starting our second conference call, which is regarding the acquisition of Micrel, and we'll hear some of you again on that call. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.","James Eric Bjornholt","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release for today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our acquisition activities and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at a record $531.3 million, including $20.2 million of non-GAAP net sales from Supertex, and were up 7.7% sequentially from net sales of $493.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter.","Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. Revenue by product line was a record $343.8 million for microcontrollers, a record of $127.8 million for analog, $33.4 million for memory, $20.4 million for licensing, and $5.9 million of other. The Supertex non-GAAP revenue was $17.6 million of analog and $2.7 million of foundry services revenue, which we classify in the Other category.","Revenue by geography was a record $103.3 million in the Americas, $109.7 million in Europe, and a record $318.3 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins where above the high end of our guidance at 59.8% in the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at the low end of our guidance at 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was above the high end of our guidance at 33.2% of sales, and net income was a record $151.6 million.","This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which is at the high end of our guidance in $0.02 about the midpoint.","On a GAAP basis, net sales were $528.9 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.1 million of share-based compensation and $7.8 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and EqcoLogic. Total operating expenses were $190.6 million, or 36% of sales, and includes acquisition intangible amortization of $36.6 million, share-based compensation of $11.3 million, $0.9 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $0.3 million, the GAAP net income of $89.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.","GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $4.5 million, which were primarily associated with integrating Supertex into Microchip's corporate structure. In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.7%, and the GAAP tax rate was 16%. The GAAP tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the $4.5 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profit, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5%.","To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments we had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.195, share-based compensation was about $0.053, nonrecurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.02, and noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.356 per share will be paid on September 4, 2014 to shareholders of record on August 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 48th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and, in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 42nd occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid amount to $2.3 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2014 was $264.5 million, or 109 days compared to 118 days at the end of the March quarter.","The inventory balance at June 30, 2014 includes $8.5 million of Supertex inventory write-up costs required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the Supertex inventory, and its associated GAAP write-up, Microchip had 108 days of inventory on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We have taken steps to increase our capacities so our inventory days don't go significantly lower in the September quarter and support the needs of our customers.","Inventory at our distributors decreased by 2 days in the June quarter to 31 days and remains at low levels compared to where they had been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At March 31, the accounts receivable balance was $286.7 million, an increase by $44.3 million on a sequential basis due to the acquisition of Supertex and the revenue growth we experienced in the quarter. Receivable balances remain in great shape.","The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition of Supertex and our dividend payment was $121.3 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.29 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit increased to $980 million. The increase in Microchip's borrowing during the June quarter was driven by our acquisition of Supertex. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the September quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $44.6 million for the June quarter, and we expect about $50 million in capital expenditures in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2015 to be about $175 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $23.3 million. I want to remind our investors and analysts that as Microchip's stock prices changes, there is a diluted share count impact for Microchip's outstanding convertible debt. There is a table on the supplemental financial informations section of Microchip's Investor Relations site that walks through the level of dilution at various stock prices that you may find helpful. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table in today's press release assumes an average Microchip stock price in the September 2014 quarter of $46 per share. However, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter, and provide an update on the Supertex and ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.","Our overall microcontroller revenue grew strongly at 5.3% sequentially in the June quarter, and was up 14.5% versus the year-ago quarter, achieving a new revenue record. All 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit experienced sequential growth in the June quarter, and all 3 microcontroller segments achieved record revenue in the June quarter. Microcontrollers represented 64.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter.","We normally don't provide much color on our 8-bit microcontroller business, but I'm going to make an exception this time, because the results are exceptional and don't always get the attention they deserve. Not only did our 8-bit microcontroller revenue achieve a new record in the June quarter, the cumulative revenue in the last 4 quarters of our 8-bit microcontroller revenue was up 11.5% over the cumulative revenue in the prior 4 quarters. We continue to gain significant share as competitors have defocused in this area, while we have continued to introduce a large number of innovative new products that have captured the imagination of a broad range of customers who have design demand.","In fact, demand for our innovative new 8-bit microcontroller products introduced over the last 3 years have been so strong, it has outstripped our ability to ramp manufacturing fast enough. Steve will talk more about that later in his section today.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 0.6% sequentially in the June quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 26.5% versus the year-ago quarter. While the 16-bit microcontroller business took a bit of a pause in the June quarter, this business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio, and we expect strong growth in the September quarter. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 21.5% sequentially in the June quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 59.8% versus the year-ago quarter. This business is now at a size and growth rate where it is making meaningful contribution to our ongoing growth. We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs and expand our presence in fields of play like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Overall, we continue to gain significant microcontroller market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now let's move to analog products. And before, I comment on the analog business, let me reiterate what Eric said in terms of how we will be reporting the Supertex business, as this is the first time we're including it in our results.","Approximately 85% to 90% of Supertex' revenue consists of proprietary analog products, which will be consolidated into our analog reporting segment. The remaining approximately 10% to 15% of Supertex business consists of providing specialty foundry services for customers to have their proprietary designs fabricated by Supertex, which will be consolidated into our reporting segment classified as Other.","All of what we have reported in the Other category historically, has been our specialty high reliability assembly and test services business that we inherited as a part our acquisition of MMT in Thailand about 3.5 years ago.","Now let's get to the performance of our analog business. Including Supertex analog products, our analog business grew 18.9% sequentially in the June quarter and was up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Including Supertex analog products revenue, our analog business represented 24% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter, and we crossed a key milestone with over $500 million of annualized analog products revenue.","We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was sequentially up 0.7%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter.","Now a short update about Supertex and where we are in the integration process. Effective July 1, Supertex operations, expanding from order entry to manufacturing to shipments to billings, are fully integrated into Microchip's business systems. Supertex had a small subscale assembly and test operation in Sunnyvale, California for a small percentage of their manufacturing. The Sunnyvale operations have been closed and the manufacturing done there has been absorbed into Microchip's Thailand facility.","Supertex has a leased 6-inch fab in San Jose, California. Prior to our acquisition, Supertex had already started to qualify many of their products at foundries for better competitiveness. After completing a detailed assessment, we have begun qualifying at Microchip's fabs, some of the products that were planned for movement to the foundries. We are also studying a long-term scalability and cost-effectiveness of Supertex 6-inch leased fab and expect to conclude our study by the end of this quarter.","Supertex subcontracts 100% of its assembly and over 60% of its test volume. We have identified and started transferring some of the products currently outsourced by Supertex into our internal assembly and test operations in Thailand.","We are also studying the long-term scalability and cost effectiveness of Supertex Hong Kong test facility, and expect to conclude our study by the end of this quarter.","As I had mentioned in our last conference call, we are retaining Supertex sales and applications engineers and have begun cross-training them, as well as our existing sales force, so that we can find revenue synergies. We have also begun to combine the channel partners of both companies with the goal to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies.","Lastly, a short update on our acquisition of Taiwan-based ISSC, which we announced on May 22nd. As you saw in our press release of July 14, we completed a very successful tender offer and now have majority ownership of ISSC. We purchased 83.5% of the outstanding shares as part of the tender offer, and have another 10.5% of outstanding shares pledged to us that we will buy when they are past a lockup agreement that expires on November 27, 2014. The full merger will take place sometime in December 2014, but we are moving ahead full speed with integration planning and integration as the full merger is a mere formality at this point. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 22, we have spent considerable time understanding ISSC's business, organization and system. We have begun developing detailed integration plans and have begun execution of some of these plans this quarter.","In regards to manufacturing, ISSC outsources 100% of its manufacturing. The fab processes used are more advanced than what Microchip's has in-house, and will therefore remain at the professional foundries where they run, which happen to be the same foundries that Microchip also runs at. We're doing a make-versus-buy analysis and evaluating whether some of the assembly and tests currently outsourced by ISSC can be brought into by the internal assembly and test operation. Microchip will transition all ISSC back-end manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipment and wafer -- and warehouses to our systems. We estimate that this transition will be complete sometime in the fourth calendar quarter of 2014, at which time, all ISSC products will be shipping from Microchip's business systems.","Regarding sales and applications, we are planning to retain ISSC's sales and applications engineers and we'll cross-train them, as well as our existing sales force, so that we can find revenue synergies. We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. A few of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while most are different, as almost all of the ISSC business was done in Taiwan and China. Our goal is to achieve significantly expanded distribution capabilities for ISSC's products. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Stephen Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2015, then I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2015.","We are very pleased with our execution in the June quarter, all of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were better than the midpoint of our guidance. Without including Supertex results, our non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, achieving a milestone again, and our non-GAAP operating profit was 33.5%. We also made excellent progress on improving Supertex operating results. Supertex non-GAAP gross margin was 54.5%, and non-GAAP operating profit was 24.5%. I remind you that Supertex standalone non-GAAP operating margin in the full calendar year '13 before the acquisition was 17.2%.","Combining Supertex results, our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, and non-GAAP operating profit was 33.2%, and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.68, and was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance.","We also made many new all-time records. Total net sales were an all-time record. In microcontrollers, 8, 16, and 32-bit microcontrollers all made new records individually and collectively. Analog product sales also achieved new all-time record. Geographically, our net sales in Americas and Asia each made all-time new record. And in the non-GAAP financials our gross margin dollars, operating profit dollars, net income dollars, and earnings per share, all made fresh all-time records in the quarter.","Last, but not the least, the June quarter was our 95th consecutively profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding quarter.","Now, on April 1, we closed the acquisition of Supertex. Ganesh highlighted the status of our integration on Supertex. We have obviously honed our skills and experience through several very successful acquisitions. Supertex contributed $0.013 attrition for the last quarter, which is about $0.01 accretion that we had guided. Now, $0.003 maybe a small difference on Microchip numbers, but it was a substantial beat on the Supertex contribution. Now, I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2015.","We are seeing a seasonally normal business environment, with strengths in many of our end markets like industrial, automotive, housing, consumer electronics and personal computing. We are seeing exceptional strength in some of our new products and technologies, which are growing at double-digit percentages sequentially.","As a result, our product delivery lead times have stretched out and we are selectively capacity constrained in fab, wafer sort, assembly and test operations, particularly on our newest products and technologies.","Our inventory of 108 days is below our targeted level of 115, and is expected to go even lower this quarter. So we're ramping all of our factories, but we're limited by equipment lead times. We have increased our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to $175 million. We also, just today, posted a Dear Customer letter on our website, www.microchip.com informing our customers about the business environment, our capacity constraints and our lead times. So you may want to look at that later.","We are also mindful of summer quarter in Europe that is usually sequentially down. So taking all these factors into account, we expect the September quarter net sales to be up 5.4% to 8.4% sequentially. This includes about $18 million of sales from ISSC, which are on our clock from July 18 to the end of the quarter.","So as Ganesh said, Microchip owns 83.5% of the shares of ISSC. Microchip will include the ISSC sales from July 18 onwards in its financial results and consolidate them line by line.","We will then back out the profits for the minority interest. I would also like to highlight that ISSC's revenue recognition through distribution is currently on a selling basis. As we integrate their business into Microchip's business systems, we will change the revenue recognition from distribution to a sell-through basis upon modifying the contractual relationships we have with the distributors.","We believe that this will happen in the December quarter, and we will share the accounting impact of this with you in the next earnings call.","Continuing on the guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59.2% and 59.6% of sales, the short-term gross margin is slightly negatively impacted from the consolidation of Supertex, as well as ISSC. ISSC gross margin is currently about 45%, longer-term we expect to improve Supertex, as well as ISSC gross margin to Microchip levels.","We expect operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.7% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.5% and 33.3% of sales, again, slightly negatively impacted by Supertex and ISSC short term.","Longer-term, we expect Supertex and ISSC's operating margins to be similar to those of Microchip's. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 and $0.74 per share, this includes about $0.015 accretion from Supertex, and about $0.01 accretion from ISSC. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis.","We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Chris Caso at Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess our first question, perhaps we could talk about the production constraints you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Does this imply that there's some business that you're not able to address right now? Are you meeting the customer delivery request in general on some of these products that have stretched out? And as a follow-on to that, if you could talk about the steps you could take when lead times start to stretch out and you've seen these constraints in the past, how you make sure that the customers aren't ordering more than they need.","Stephen Sanghi","So, definitely, we are leaving out some revenue due to supply constraints in the September quarter. We cannot really dollarize that number, because we don't really know what other additional customer demand will come in for the fiscal quarter 2, and what product mix that demand will come in. In fact, I mentioned that, we posted a Dear Customer letter on our website today, and this letter will start going out to our customers immediately and, hopefully, we will have a much better idea of the supply constraints in the coming weeks.","At the same time, we're also working actually quite hard to improve the supply in expediting equipment from our vendors. So an accurate estimate would be difficult on a short-term basis, but we are definitely leaving out some revenue on the table. The obvious question can be that are we losing any designs or market share because of that? Our microcontroller revenue in the June quarter was up 14.5% versus a year-ago quarter. As you know, from really any market growth numbers, that far exceeds any market data for growth of microcontrollers. So, overall, we're gaining market share and actually gaining substantial market share. The products that we have constraints on are very special products with unique features and very high growth. The products were actually -- these products are killing the competition. The new designs will be in production in about a year or longer for anybody who's thinking or doing a new design with these products. So, short-term constraints, I don't think, are going to impact design wins because our customers know our track record for the last 25 years, and these are shorter-term problems that we will solve them quickly.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, With respect to the gross margins, and I guess with -- you've given us the ISSC margins, so we could figure out the impact of that on your margin guidance. But for the underlying Microchip margins, with production increasing next quarter, could you talk to us about how that works its way through the income statement? What sort of benefits you see there? And perhaps, how long you'd expect that benefit to continue with the inventory down below your target levels? I suppose this wouldn't be something that you'd get back to normal in just a quarter.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, so, as I mentioned, the inventory this quarter actually will decline further. So we're actually taking inventory from the balance sheet and asking -- adding to your cost of goods sold. So, I would say that core Microchip margins are in the same range where they were last quarter, plus some or minus some, but usually on the good side. And then they are somewhat negatively impacted by integrating a 45% margin on about $18 million sales from ISSC. And there is Supertex effect also because their margin is at 54.5% and also slightly lower than Microchip, but they were in the numbers last quarter also, and we are also picking up a fair amount of old inventory from Supertex that we're shipping now because of first in, first out. So there are a large number of moving products, but overall margin is in excellent shape.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. But as the production increases, once the capacity is in place, I guess that would suggest better fixed-cost absorption, improvements to margins once that occurred?","Stephen Sanghi","Yes, the answer to that will be correct. Yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question on the equipment. You mentioned some equipment has extended lead times. Are you referring specifically to testing equipment or packaging equipment? Could you give us a little more perspective there?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, it's predominantly fab and test. There is assembly also, but there are few challenges, but it's -- the majority of that is really the fab and test. Test in 2 places, wafer test as well as final test.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, do you get the sense that your competitors are experiencing the same sort of issues, where -- when you talk to your customers, or do you think your situation is a little bit unique?","Stephen Sanghi","We are not focused on our competitors. We're focused on our customers. I don't really know what competitors are experiencing. I mean, our growth rate is just phenomenal. Some of the numbers I have seen on microcontroller growth rates and analog growth rates from some of the competitors we have announced in the earnings season, and sometimes you have to look at the numbers in a rolling 4 quarter cumulative over the similar 4 quarters prior because a single quarter can play games. Everybody has different seasonality. When you're shipping from -- when you're building product and shipping from inventory, it's the totality of it that counts. So, our numbers are, so far, above the competition. And I think the average, when I did the chart yesterday, that 4 quarter over prior 4 quarter comparison, and the average of that was about 4.5%. And the number for Microchip is 15.2. So, we're doing phenomenal on our products, in our growth, in microcontroller, in analog, and that was not expected a year ago that we'll have those kind of growth rates. And as a result, with long lead times on equipment, we're having some capacity challenges.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach at Morgan Stanley.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Vinayak calling in for Craig. I had a question on the ISSC. I think you indicated that your guide has $18 million in revenue. What's the related OpEx to that? And like -- as you stop integrated Supertex, like, any negative or positive surprises that have come along?","Stephen Sanghi","So, I think you can calculate that in dollars, but the ISSC's current model is 45% gross margin, 26% expenses, 19% operating profit. That's what they're doing standalone. And you can kind of do the math on it, and we will improve it substantially on our clock, but always take some time.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And any negative and positive surprises over the last quarter in Supertex?","Stephen Sanghi","No, we did outstanding. We did a revenue guidance. We did our internal gross margin. We did very well in managing expenses, and accretion was 30% better than what we guided, $0.013 versus $0.01. So you have to divide that by Microchip's 223 million shares, so the numbers become miniscule. But standalone, we did very well on what we set out to do.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And my follow-up, so automotive has been a growth engine, like, both for analog and MCU. Can you just touch upon, like, the opportunities you have seen and any new product introduction towards automotive, especially on the 32-bit side?","Stephen Sanghi","Go ahead, Ganesh.","Ganesh Moorthy","So, we play in a broad range of automotive applications. We're not focused on any single item engine control or whatever. In many of the applications, we are the main microcontroller. Those tend to be associated with the body electronics, some of the networking inside of the car. In many of the other applications, we are the auxiliary microcontroller. There's somebody else that's micro, which is a large high-performance microcontroller. So there's no specific single application that is driving the growth. Clearly, we're winning more than our fair share of applications, and the number of cars being built is growing as well. So those are the 2 factors driving the automotive part of our business.","Stephen Sanghi","To add a little bit in the medical field for what Ganesh said, kind of how broadly our products go into automotive, and we're not really focused on really designing one product, if you go buy today an S-Class Mercedes, you'll be buying 51 chips from Microchip. I think there are about 30 or so microcontroller. There are some analog products and there are some others. If you buy a Hyundai Genesis...","Ganesh Moorthy","54 of them in it.","Stephen Sanghi","54 different chips from Microchip all over the car. So those are a couple of representative examples where we're not trying to win this by having one part that goes into the car. We are trying to win it by having 30, 40 chips on the car from up and down the car in all different applications. In each of those applications be -- our part be the main part.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar at Stephens Investment Bank.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of really quick questions. Stephen, in your press release and in your script, you mentioned, you are seeing exceptional strength at some of your newer products. So I'm curious if you could just give us some more color. Is this the -- are these the products you are recently buying or is this like products that are out in the last 3 to 4 years?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, let me make an attempt on it. The conventional wisdom has been that 8-bit microcontroller is declining, and all the customers want is really to convert to 32-bit microcontrollers. And you have heard us over the years, we have disagreed with that conventional wisdom for many years. Our 8-bit as well as our 16-bit microcontroller businesses have performed extremely well, in addition to our 32-bit microcontroller, and Ganesh talked about all of them. In fact all 3 microcontroller types, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit, made new records in the quarter. Now the growth here now in 16- and 32-bit microcontroller has been very good and a lot more predictable. We plan for those kind of high numbers, and we're achieving it. I think the surprise was in the 8-bit because kind of nobody gives it the credit. When we talk to the street, analysts and investors, they're all interested asking about 32-bit. We introduced a significant number of new 8-bit products, including a new very high-efficiency 8-bit core and the entire family of products based on that core that can use C programming language, like the higher end 16- and 32-bit microcontrollers. We also introduced a category of core independent peripherals that allow our customers to run the peripheral functions without the microcontroller core engine running or without consuming the CPU power. These have allowed our customers to expand the use of 8-bit microcontrollers dramatically, and the demand for many of these products have really exploded. These products are built on our latest process technology, proprietary technology that we run in our Gresham fab. So the demand for this process technology is growing at a rate of 15% to 20% per quarter, starting from a fairly large base. The success of these and other 8-bit microcontroller products is unprecedented -- it's unprecedented even measuring at a very successful microcontroller track record, even against that very successful track record at Microchip. We're also seeing that the entire competitive threat of trying to insert the M0 Cortex 32-bit ARM core into the 8-bit microcontroller socket really has petered out. These products had 32-bit engine, but otherwise no peripherals or features. They were largely bait-and-switch kind of products, and customers have seen the hollow offering. The result is that our 8-bit microcontroller business is extremely strong, making new records, and currently capacity constrained, but hopefully not for very long because we're growing capacity rapidly.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Appreciate it, Steve. That was very helpful. And then, as my follow-up, if I can ask you, with the new additions to your Microchip business, Supertex and ISSC, perhaps maybe help us think about how we should think of the seasonality. Is it still largely unchanged? Or will you see more of sort of a consumer effect now in the December quarter?","Stephen Sanghi","Every acquisition modifies it a little bit. These acquisitions are not extremely large, but ISSC is very consumer-ish, and it will change the seasonality a little bit. Supertex does not change it as much. They're kind of similar to ours, much more industrial. SMSC did change the seasonality a little bit. They were a little more on PCs than we were. Yes, so these all have impacts.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Follow-up question on the capacity constraints. So it sounds like from your last answer there, mostly this is hitting on the 8-bit side. Is it not possible for you at this point to change the mix and shift some of your capacity over to that which is being constrained? Or are you seeing a broader-based constraint that's really hitting all of your products? And if you could just clarify really where those constraints are kicking in and why mix can't be changed or why it's not worthwhile, to do that at this point, that'd be helpful.","Stephen Sanghi","Well, so, these -- many of the products that are growing 15% to 20% sequentially are built on our latest advanced technology, so you can't really use the older capacity for these, and we have to add new capacity. Within the products itself, obviously, we're changing mix to build the products, which are stronger, but I think they're all largely doing very well. We're constrained overall on the products on their technology. So even after changing the mix within, the entire number of wafers, we got to run on that technology are 20%, 30% higher than really what I can run today. And we just made an increase just this last month. There is another one happening on August 1, which is tomorrow. We increase the wafer starts. There's another one scheduled for October 1, another one scheduled for January 1. So we are bringing this new equipment, adding it and some of that has been in the works for months, if not quarters, and we've been constantly adding, and we keep thinking that demand will moderate. But from a fairly large base, the demand has continued, which is really the strength of the products. I mean, everybody bad mouths 8-bit, and competitors have backed off, and everybody wants to sell a Cortex core. We defied that conventional wisdom. We were right. We are so successful at that. 8-bit is adding the largest dollar revenue in growth. And we're the only man standing almost.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","That's really helpful. If I can just get a follow-up in on the 16-bit side, obviously, that's grown very strongly as you said in the trailing 12 months year-over-year. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on what you think the pause was. Is this just a timing issue of particular design wins that aren't starting for a bit? Or is this a specific end market that might be weak or a specific application, and why you're confident that, that's going to pick up again in this quarter?","Ganesh Moorthy","There are smaller changes quarter-to-quarter when people's timings, et cetera, of when they want to purchase may be adjusted. But if you go back and look, it's had a very strong quarter before that. We're expecting a strong quarter. So what falls into any one 90-day period isn't reflective of the business. I think if you look at it over a 12-month period of time, it evens all that out. And so we see the design wins. We see the customers ramping. We're confident in the product line going forward.","Stephen Sanghi","We have seen the same thing on 32-bit. 32-bit did very well last quarter. But if you look at the quarter before, 32-bit had a very low single-digit growth. So these smaller product lines, 16, 32, although they're fairly sizable, their growth rate doesn't seem to match the corporate and the seasonality. Overall, both are doing very well year-over-year, but quarters are uncertain. So on 16-bit, our current quarter backlog is up by double digit. I'm not saying it will end there, but I think it will end very well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from William Stein at SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm hoping you can give us a little bit more granularity or detail to try to understand the degree to which these lead times are -- the stretch lead times or the shortages are felt broadly across the portfolio. Is it relatively narrow number of products that are affected, or is it broadly speaking? And maybe if you can quantify to what degree you've seen lead times stretch.","Stephen Sanghi","So, the letter we posted today, it says our lead times are from 6 weeks to 18 weeks plus. And Microchip sells over 100,000 SKUs, so it's really kind of all over the place. Anytime people want a headline number, our lead times are x weeks. There's really no such thing. When you have 100,000 SKUs, there are parts that you can get off the shelf because in any mix situation, there's always some parts available. But in any reasonable volume, we can do it in as little as 6 weeks, and many of them are 18 weeks plus. But these constraints are fairly significant, I would say.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And following up on that, perhaps you can give us a sense as to when you expect that supply will be more in line with demand. You talked about adding capacity. I think, tomorrow, you said, you're adding some new capacity and then you have something planned for, I think you said, January. When would you expect to see a relative balance between supply and demand?","Stephen Sanghi","The supply-demand balances are hard to predict. I know what additional supply we're bringing in because we know the wafer start ramp and similar ramp in the assembly and test. Now matching it against to what demand may materialize, that's a difficult one. We don't know what demand does in December quarter and in March quarter next year. Will the rate of growth of these products continue? It looks like we dramatically beat our own internal expectations. A year ago, what we predicted regarding these products will do, we were wrong. They are doing significantly extremely better than that. I mean, if a year ago I would have told you that the 8-bit can grow in double digits, you wouldn't have believed it. So I can't tell you exactly the time frame when the problems get resolved, but we are adding a lot of new capacity and they will get better.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","If I could just sneak one more quick one in. I mean, you're known as kind of the cycle maven in semis. You've done very well predicting this for all the investors in the past. It feels very much now like the market is telling us that something is going to roll over soon. Your results certainly don't seem to foretell that. To what degree does this, to you, feel like sort of the last run before the tightness gets resolved and suddenly you wind up having a pause in demand versus kind of a more beginning stages of extended improving demand?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, I carry a heavy burden on my shoulders for semi vision, but I'm not seeing any rollover right now. I think, wind is on our back.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ray Rund at Shaker Investments.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","Steve, I -- actually most of my questions have been answered. I was just curious if you could just repeat what the breakdown was in terms of the different revenue by product area that you went through at the beginning. You kind of did it pretty fast.","James Eric Bjornholt","This is Eric, I can do that. So microcontrollers were $343.8 million, Analog was $127.8 million, memory was $33.4 million, licensing was $20.4 million, and other was $5.9 million.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","As a follow-up question, can -- you mentioned that your -- the analog, excluding Supertex, was up very -- I think less than 1% sequentially. Is there any reason why analog has slowed down in the last couple of quarters?","Ganesh Moorthy","Like we mentioned for our 16-bit product line, if you -- I think quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be sometimes a larger than expected growth and sometimes a smaller than expected growth. This isn't the totality of how it's been doing year-over-year on an annualized basis, and you'll find that the analog business has had fantastic growth throughout this time.","Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.","Well, that's quite true. And...","Stephen Sanghi","It was not 1%, by the way. Our analog business without Supertex grew 2.6% sequentially.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill at Needham & Company.","Unknown Analyst","Josh [ph] in for Raji. Most of them have been answered, but could you please give us some color on end markets. I know you mentioned a little bit with auto before, but more color there would be helpful.","Stephen Sanghi","So I think -- I kind of mentioned we are seeing strength in industrial. We're seeing strength in auto. We're seeing strength in housing. We ship a lot of parts into -- also to housing, appliances, garage door openers, security systems and all the kind of stuff. We're seeing strength in consumer electronics and kind of things we do. We don't go into the cell phone, but the other consumer electronics and the unique one is personal computing. I think if you listen to the Intel commentary and their results, the PCs are going through refresh cycles. So our PC exposure has gone up with the acquisition of SMSC. In fact, 2 different divisions of SMSC. One that does the embedded controller for the PCs, and the other division does Ethernet, LAN, USB and all that. We have seen that market strengthening also. So we're seeing strength in many of these end markets. I believe the market that kind of has been weak was the smartphone. And that's where Microchip doesn't have exposure. So I think, we've done well largely because we try to stay away from that market. We don't like its margins. We don't like its customers. We don't like a number of things about it.","Unknown Analyst","That's very helpful. And then lastly, on SMSC, last quarter, I think you mentioned you thought you're about halfway to the point where it was -- had a reasonable potential for accretion. Can you maybe update us there where that progress is? Has it been complicated at all by Supertex?","James Eric Bjornholt","I'll let Ganesh respond to that, but what we said last quarter is we were halfway there on kind of integrating back-end assembly and test manufacturing.","Ganesh Moorthy","That is exactly what we said. And so -- and we were actually a little less than 50% at that point in time. Those -- not everything that is outsourced makes sense to bring in-house. We go -- we do that case by case, and there's some accretion in SMSC that over time will come as we sell those designs to a broader set of customers using Microchip sales teams and all of that. But SMSC has done exceedingly well and better than what we had expected in its contribution to Microchip.","Stephen Sanghi","So SMSC's gross and operating margins are now at the Microchip level. And further improvements are possible as we bring some of the small stuff in. But already, SMSC's gross and operating margins are right on the top of Microchip.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gill Alexandre at Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","Could you update us on your long-term model, what you'd like to have your gross margins at and your operating expenses? And you mentioned your operating profit goals of 35% now?","Stephen Sanghi","So, Gill, let me sort of remind everyone, we haven't changed it, so our long-term gross margin model is 61.5%, plus\/minus 0.5%. Our operating expense target is 26.5%, plus\/minus 0.5%. And our operating margin target is 35%, plus\/minus 1%, if you just look at all the low and high. What's really -- what's holding us back a little bit are really the acquisitions. It's very difficult to go out and find an acquisition that's performing at Microchip kind of financials today. In fact, we have found none. So the acquisitions we buy, SST, SMSC, Supertex, ISSC, did all in the gross margins between 45% and 55%, operating margins in teens, pretty much all of them. And SST was worse than that. It wasn't making any money. And then, we take on the task through pruning and expense reduction and margin improvement and moving them to our factories and choosing what to make and not to make, and selecting the product lines, and getting our sales and applications infrastructure to go sell them better to get them into our operating profit. We did that with SST. We did that with SMSC. We're making huge improvement with Supertex, as I mentioned. The operating margin was 17%, and now it's 25%. And we've got to go the rest of the way. In ISSC, we have just begun, we close the deal about a week ago.","Gilbert Alexandre","Could you give me an idea of how much money you have overseas?","Stephen Sanghi","Lots.","James Eric Bjornholt","The vast majority of our cash and investment balance is offshore, and that's why we're borrowers in the U.S. So we manage our U.S. balance to keep our borrowings as low as possible, but the vast majority of cash is offshore.","Gilbert Alexandre","And your estimated depreciation for fiscal '15?","James Eric Bjornholt","It depends on the capital that we're bringing in and how that ramps on. But it's probably going to be somewhere between $97 million and $100 million, so it will be up year-over-year.","Gilbert Alexandre","And could you remind me what ISSC sales are?","Stephen Sanghi","So in the -- so one is the public number for the last quarter, which is known, which is what?","Ganesh Moorthy","The last public number is for the June quarter. I know in NT dollars, that's TWD 638 million.","James Eric Bjornholt","So about $21 million. And I think in the last calendar year they were about $70 million -- $69 million.","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, just over $69 million.","Stephen Sanghi","So the June quarter, publicly announced sales were about $21 million. And this quarter would be higher than that, but we have to reassure the sales from July 18 to the end of the quarter, and that we have guided to be $18 million.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, a lot of them have been answered. But as you guys integrate more and more of these acquisitions, thinking about the core Microchip revenue is becoming harder and harder, but when I looked to the September guidance, if you kind of look at kind of the -- take out the acquisition revenue, I'm getting to sort of a flat core sequential growth. One, is that right? And two, even if it's not, I'm just kind of curious, given the capacity constraints, how much better could the September guidance have been if you didn't have some of the capacity constraints?","Stephen Sanghi","So the answer to your first question, I think, Microchip core business is growing quite substantially, so I don't know where you're coming up with flat, if you did that just for a quarter, so I don't know. But if you look at 4 quarters over 4 quarters, fiscal year '14 over fiscal year '13, we've had very, very substantial growth net of acquisition.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, I was talking more sequential June to September.","Stephen Sanghi","Oh, June to September.","Ganesh Moorthy","That's up 3.5%.","James Eric Bjornholt","Midpoint of that guidance is 3.5% plus the $18 million coming on from ISSC.","Stephen Sanghi","So Supertex was -- and that may be the confusion. So Supertex was closed on April 1. So the entire Supertex was included in our June numbers. So including Supertex, June to September, the midpoint of our growth is 3.5%, not flat. And then, add 18% on the top of that -- $18 million, which takes the overall growth to about 6.9%.","John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What could the 3.5% have been had you not had some of the capacity constraints that you do?","Stephen Sanghi","Well, that's -- I can't tell you that. I don't know.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Kevin Cassidy at Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","The ISSC, how much of their product will be attached, do you think, to your microcontrollers or will it be similar to when you first came into the analog market? And eventually, this will sell on its own or do you expect that 1 plus 1 equals 3 with your microcontrollers plus ISSC?","Ganesh Moorthy","Clearly, we expect many of the products will marry up with a microcontroller sometimes with our memory as well as sometimes with our analog. The applications they go into, in many cases, we have served, but without the solution that ISSC has brought. But I think the large opportunity in ISSC also is to take it outside of Taiwan and China, which is where the predominant revenue for them is all coming from. And there, we have our sales channels and customer relationships, where existing products that customers are building but missing the components that ISSC builds, automatically becomes a quick addition that we can make. So we're expecting that many, many ISSC products will be sold next to our microcontrollers.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And can you give us some idea what the cost split is between front end and back end? You say you're going to move the back-end portion to internal manufacturing?","Ganesh Moorthy","So we don't break that out. And even the timeline for when it can be done -- not everything that ISSC manufactures will make sense to move in-house. So we go systematically, item by item, with the objective of making sure that we get to a lower cost, bringing it in-house, and a percentage of what they do will make sense and some of it will not. But that analysis is not complete, and we don't break out the back end versus front end components of that.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","Stephen Sanghi","Okay. Well, thank you very much for attending our conference call. We'll see some of you on the road as we're doing any conferences. Otherwise, we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation."],"14403":["Microchip Technology, Inc.

Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO.","I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve, Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million. They were well above the high end of our guidance and were up [3.5%] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition.","Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end-market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high end of our guidance of 29%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year.","On GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million, and gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share-based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs.","Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million.","With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term, forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%.","Share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensation came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at September 30, 2016 was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory, as required by GAAP purchase accounting, is now off of the balance sheet. There is still $12 million of fair value markup relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which was down from the June quarter level of 32 days.","Cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30 were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction in our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels in our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter.","We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt to EBITDA, ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we had shared with the Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017.","Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million.","For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as the fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially, as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well Atmel's microcontroller business were each up nicely in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, as we continued to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records for revenue.","Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business, as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter, once again demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the death of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions.","During the quarter, Atmel's customers continued to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller roadmaps, going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM 32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design and funnel and expect this to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.","In regards to the Microcontroller business units integration, we had already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine roadmaps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities.","Our touch and gesture business, focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets, took further shape in the September quarter and we are driving opportunities with a stronger set of customers and channeled relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little later on the sale of the Mobile Touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers.","We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we are also getting appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter, and we'll have some residual benefit in future quarters.","Finally, microcontrollers had over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue, representing 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Moving now to our analog products, our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel Microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.","Moving to our memory products, our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business, too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive we're not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.","Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements, our sales integration is progressing well with extensive cross training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partner sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we want to leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products on new customer design activity.","We are in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live.","All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and helped deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance is going forward and more about the Atmel integration.","Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.","Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, and operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of a year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage, and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel.","We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter.","In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100 day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I would update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority.","Number one, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low price, low margin quotes being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below the market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore we would not be concerned about losing business.","On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program under which the distribution earned higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing the commitment for demand creation for Microchip.","Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales, and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop.","Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we're aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip.","Number four, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. With the broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans which are based on overall company growth and profitability, we are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable.","Number five, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip spreads equity throughout the organization so that they share in the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews.","With the entire company on a Microchip-type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our managers role-modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly.","Number six. Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short six months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over two-third of the employee base have gone through at least one training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers through a two-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which we train the employees on Microchip's Client Engagement Process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and rewards system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do but rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip, and the results are starting to improve.","Now let us continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets: we achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business, and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter.","Now, on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis point sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over five years. There are a lot of moving parts, but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and pegging it back to when the contracts were done and protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs and the memory business and there are plenty of cost reductions mixed in.","Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales.","With the combined effect of better than expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over five years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share versus our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.","By any measure, our September quarter results are stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had three major concerns. They were: can we grow Atmel's business? Can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins? And can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins and we are improving the execution. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip, we means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel.","So, now, let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat to down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% to 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share.","Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year 2017 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year 2017. We have also assessed whether the upside in accretion from Atmel is pulling off long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both. So let me catch up the math for everyone.","Our original accretion target for fiscal year 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90 respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year 2017, 2018, and 2019 to be $0.33, $0.66, and $0.90 respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now, after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.","Now, we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 is now past. So we're not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for a future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year 2017, 2018, 2019 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So, once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So now our new accretion target for fiscal year 2017 without any stock buyback I already gave you is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year 2018 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now; and for fiscal year 2019, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets now at or above our original target when we assumed buying back stock. For fiscal year 2017, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback, and 50% higher than our initial estimate including the stock buyback. This is all a testament to how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first seven months since the close of the transaction.","On Micrel side, the integration is complete, the fab will close at the end of next week, the last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak, a large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model from Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.","We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an IP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of Mobile Touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week.","Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results from the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year 2018 versus three to four years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins.","With this, Operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, of course. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on your strong execution. Steve, for my first question, I am wondering, you have reported very strong results for the last couple of quarters. How much of that would you attribute to a better organic demand environment versus share gains or just conservatism or pricing actions with Atmel products?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We are unable to break that out for you. It's a sum total, and when we win a business, we don't know whether we're winning that business because we've got great product, because we're gaining share, whether the customer end demand was stronger, it's really always a combination. I think the sense of the overall market demand, you can get that from the average of industry announcements from our peers and competitors, and then you can compare them to our results and kind of make your own assessment.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And my follow-up, on the gross margin, you upsided this last quarter, I was curious what drove that upside, was it the pricing action? And just if I take that forward, what is the path from the current levels you're at, to your 59% target? How much of that would be based on revenue versus other sort of self-help actions that you can take? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, again, I think your questions and intent is always to kind of piece everything, break it up. But this is kind of hard to do. I gave you nuggets of information. There was a 400 basis points improvement on Atmel gross margin, Microchip's, the core Microchip business gross margins were also up nicely. The increase on Microchip business was much more organic, better mix, better absorption with the growth, better this, better that, slightly but the 400 basis points impact on Atmel gross margin, I broke it out for you, was a result of pricing increases, setting back many of the customer contracts in U.S. dollars back to where the contract was originally done, taking away the impact of weak euro, weak pound and those kinds of things. And there was a better mix on Atmel side also. So, again, lots of moving parts.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And over time, as we are winning new business, it's on a more disciplined pricing basis that the new business is being won. So, in that, as it goes to production four, six quarters from now, it will all be at good margins.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Right. I think the last piece of your question was getting to the 59%. There's a lot of different things that factor into that. We've got the Micrel accretion from shutting the fab, which Steve dollarized for you in his comments. Lots of cost reduction activities that are happening between the combined factory management teams of Microchip and Atmel, So, lots of good things coming.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on, we'll take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Steve, when you closed \u2013 or when you announced the Atmel acquisition, you talked about that company's gross margins as being structurally lower than Microchip's. And I'm wondering as you've integrated and improved that business if there's any chance for a change in that view. Could you see Atmel's margin structure approach what classic Microchip has delivered?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, it's just all a matter of timing. Yes, Atmel's business structurally is slightly lower gross margin driven by a little more consumer mix and really where they have done a lot of the contracts and pricing over time. Now, as we proceed forward, the new products we are building, the new products we're introducing, the new contracts we're doing, the work we're doing with distribution, they will all be very good similar gross margins to Microchip. But it will take a long period of time before you can pay back all the orders sins. Many of them we are correcting in increasing the prices, but many of them are old customer contracts which have clauses where we cannot change them.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And one more, if I can, related to Atmel still. Can you comment on any revenue synergies you're seeing? Obviously, the pricing discipline has helped a lot. What about cross-selling the product?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, Ganesh commented on it, that our sales force is very much focused on identifying the analog attach opportunity across all of the Atmel's microcontroller and other products. We have done this traditionally with Microchip microcontroller products where there's a large amount of analog that goes around it and to the best of our ability, we tried to capture that attach. But getting all this Atmel microcontroller business gives us new, fresh opportunity to identify all the analog attach opportunity around it. And our sales force is identifying opportunities. We're adding them to the funnel. In many cases, there are substitute products, in many cases, there are design-in products, which will take a year or so to go to production. But in the coming quarters, you will see significant impact from analog attach to the Atmel products.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, and congrats on the good results.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you and congratulations on all the hard work and results. You had mentioned 8-bit revenues still increasing. And could you explain a little more if it's current customers expanding their revenue or are there many new applications? Is this a phenomenon of the Internet of Things?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, it's all of the above. We have never bought Street notion that 8-bit is dead, everything is going to 32-bit. That notion has been around from 1994, and I have a cover page EE Times article from that time. And so Microchip has been short for those people since 1994, when the stock was $0.57 in the current currency.","So our 8-bit business is extremely profitable, extremely good margins, operating as well as gross. The business did record on core as well as total, as Ganesh mentioned. We are continuing to introduce a large number of new products with new features. We're garnering new customers, existing customers where businesses are growing. We are not seeing what everybody keeps talking about, but please, everybody keeps talking about because that takes everyone away from 8-bit and turn to something else and we're enjoying this business quite a bit.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Maybe as a follow-on, do you see attach designs like with wireless or Bluetooth with the 8-bit? Would that be an indicator of new applications?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You want to take that?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think it's necessarily with Bluetooth and wireless. I think there are plenty of areas where people are trying to make devices smart. And if you have innovative new products available as 8-bit microcontrollers, often they are the most cost-effective products to apply to these new systems that are being designed. And we are probably the minority of companies that has innovated to put lots of new capabilities in 8-bit microcontrollers. We are doing that not only on PIC but the Microchip product line before but also an AVR, the Atmel product that we've inherited. And I think if you have products that are innovative at the right price point, which are easy to design in to many systems, they will. I don't think they're anything related necessarily to Bluetooth and wireless \u2013 and Wi-Fi specifically.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Hi. This is Vinay, calling in for Craig. Congrats on a solid quarter. I want to touch upon Atmel integration and acknowledging it's still early on but you're making very good progress. Could you touch upon the opportunities you are seeing for savings on the manufacturing front and any potential synergies on the back end longer term?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Could you clarify what is the managed action fund, you said?","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Oh, any savings that you can accrue on the manufacturing front?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Oh, manufacturing front.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Manufacturing front. So we talked about it last quarter that we are \u2013 we have decided to keep the Colorado Atmel fab, which we found to be very cost-effective fab and very useful for our plans going forward. So we're not going to do anything. There were Street expectations that we're going to shut down that fab. We never said that and we don't know where that came from, but we are not shutting down Atmel's 6-inch Colorado fab. It's very, very nice fab.","Now when you look at the back end, Atmel did majority of the assembly and test all at the subcontractors. They did no assembly themselves and 90% of the test was outside. They only did some wafer probe in Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe and about 60%, 70% of our assembly and about 90% plus of our test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test cost structure, Microchip's testing technologies, assembly technologies at lower cost than some of that Atmel is using. And we have put plans together, and some of the lead products are already getting qualified and would be in production next quarter where we're going to be shipping many of these products through Microchip's back end at much lower cost than they currently are. We have not given any guidance on what the impact of all that would be in the coming years. And I think as we get further down, we'll give you more update on that.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Got it.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And that's what we've done on all our previous acquisitions, by the way. There are benefits to be had that are faster on materials than just combined purchasing power. There are benefits to be had in bringing selectively some of the manufacturing into our own factories and having the economies of scale to go with it. And it all takes time to put it together, qualify it, get customers qualified but eventually it does happen.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Got it. That's helpful. From a follow-up, I want to touch upon your analog portfolio like where you have pretty good scale now, right, $900 million in annualized revenue. Could you touch upon some of the growth drivers do you see for the business longer-term?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Analog is made up of thousands of products. There's no single silver bullet that's going to drive the growth across the various categories I talked about, power, mixed-signal, linear, interface, security, clocks. All of these product lines need many, many permutations and combinations to service the broad range of requirements in the marketplace. And then we're seeing nice growth in the many different categories of analog, and that's ultimately how it gets built is in a broad range of products and applications.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and congrats on the solid quarterly performance in getting the op margins to 30%. You guys originally had a target of $4.25 per share of earnings power in fiscal year 2019. If I add the incremental Atmel accretion that you articulated, Steve, that goes to $4.40 per share but the overall core Microchip business seems to be doing extremely well as well. So how should we think about the new fiscal year 2019 earnings power?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Honestly, I don't have the math in front of me, and I don't want to make a comment that I haven't done any math on. I think I gave you the accretion map on Atmel and you could piece it back together, by figuring out what the core was and you can do your analysis. Unless I had it in front of me, I wouldn't want to make an error.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. On the closure of the Micrel fab in October, obviously that did not contribute yet to the gross margin performance, but how long roughly is it going to take for you guys to deplete the inventories out of that fab and start recognizing the benefits of the lower cost 8-inch fab and how should we think about the impact to margins and again, when does that start to kick in?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, I would say that we've been shipping some of the 8-inch products already as of last quarter and this quarter. The amount we're shipping from 8-inch right now is only about, maybe, 10% or 15% of the overall product. Over the six months, 90% of it's probably gone. And then there is a tail end, which is longer term, which continues afterwards. So the bulk of that really comes into our numbers in the next six to nine months, I think. By June, July timeframe, I think you would have seen about 90% of it.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, in the prepared remarks you talked about building cash for an acquisition. Is this a little bit of a change from what you've been thinking in the last three to six months? Why-what do you see out there? Is there some sort of sense of urgency or anything like that? And then what, if any, potential timing could this be?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","There is no change. The change is that we're not going to buy the stock back. And when I wanted to buy the stock back at $40, where the opportunity presented as low as $38. But you recall there was \u2013 Street was really concerned about China at that time and they were concerned about the leverage and they didn't want us to buy the stock back. And we were not concerned about China back in January, as I was telling you there. But the wisdom that prevailed at that time was to not buy the stock back and now the stock is in $60s. So we believe this is not the time to buy back stock. Instead, we will keep the balance sheet as stronger than levering it further by stock buyback and really prepare for the next acquisition, which we were going to do anyway. We're always looking for acquisitions, as you have seen over time.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. And then a little bit of a near-term question for my follow-up. For the guide for the December quarter, for the combined company, would you say that that is a little less than seasonal, or normal seasonality? And then any comments on what you think normal seasonality for the March quarter would be conceptually for the newly-combined company?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't have anything that I could give you from a guidance perspective. This will be our first quarter with Atmel last March quarter was really \u2013 you can't really compare against that. They were under an acquisition and the March quarter was terrible. They lost money in that and all these other things. So, I would say Atmel's business in the March quarter, the consumer part of the business should be down. The rest we have to see how it works out? Microchips, core Microchip March business usually is up from a low-single digits, and we have to combine that with Atmel and figure out what would happen.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then the December quarter, please?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","In December quarter?","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. The first part of that question was, is your December quarter guidance like normal seasonality? Or is it a little bit worse than that?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well again, what's normal seasonality? I don't know what the normal seasonality is with Atmel mixed in.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Me neither. That's why I'm asking you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't know.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So it must be normal.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","This is the normal. This is the first time, so this is it.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Hello, Gil.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Question. As you look on the contract business, which is coming back to the states for Christmas, how do you see that business versus last year?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The Christmas bills have shifted dramatically in time in the last five years or so and has been happening incrementally. And let me explain what the shift is. It used to be the case that most of the Christmas builds would be in our revenue in the September quarter because parts get built in Asia. So whatever is being built, equipment gets built by the end of September and gets on ships for six-week journey to U.S. over the ocean and arrives here in time for Thanksgiving when the stores are then full of merchandise. That used to be the case.","Increasingly in the last five years plus, what we have seen is the Christmas build is later and later and later. Nobody rushes to build it in September anymore. Parts get built all the time in October and November. A lot of it gets shipped by air rather than getting shipped by sea. And even the heavy items sometimes it gets shipped by the sea and they arrive in November and December. And many a times, there are IOUs where certain product is not available before Christmas, and you put an IOU under the Christmas tree and then you take delivery in January. A lot of the gift card giving has driven that also where people kind of gift gift-cards and then they're actually buying the merchandise in January. So the entire Christmas buying, which largely used to happen prior to the end of September, is now really spread out.","Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you and congratulations as well. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing by end markets. Any kind of color commentary with respect to automotive, industrial, medical equipment, any insights there would be help.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We see some of the strengths that others have responded to as well in automotive and industrial, but there's nothing that stands out. We have a part of our business that has a computing exposure to it, and the same strength that players in that space have seen we've seen as well. But it's nothing dramatic in one direction or another. It's generally consistent with what industry patterns have been.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","And I know it might be difficult to assess now, but given the consolidation that's been going on in the semiconductor industry and, namely, a massive merger in your space, microcontroller space, with NXPI and Qualcomm coming together, wondering how you're looking at the competitive environment going forward, given the consolidation that's happening around you. You've made an acquisition as well. Just wanted to get maybe a high-level thought process in terms of how you're positioning the company in light of all these external events?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, people ask us the same question when Freescale was getting acquired. They asked us the same question when Renesas was forming with NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi. And now we're getting the same question with NXP. And I think microcontroller market remains competitive. There are a number of players. We compete with Renesas, NXP, STMicro, Microchip, and others, some smaller players. The market remains vibrant and competitive and Qualcomm purchasing NXPI would not really change anything, because Qualcomm was not a microcontroller supplier. So the same product line that NXP had will continue, and we're not seeing any change now. Although the close of the acquisition is about a year away, we're not expecting to see any change coming out of that.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","But you've seen consolidation in the microcontroller market because it's been fragmented, and so you've seen that occur over the course of several years. And so I'm just wondering, do you see \u2013 do you anticipate more consolidation in the market within the microcontroller market or other players perhaps moving into the market that are outside of the MC space.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Honestly, Raj, there is nothing in our strategy that is saying there are a bunch of new players coming in the microcontroller market, our strategy is not based on that, we're not seeing that. If the question is: will there be more consolidation? That is sure to happen. I think there've been companies acquired in the last year, especially Altera, NXP, Freescale that we would not have \u2013 and Linear, we would not have expected those mergers to happen.","So, if those can happen, I am sure there will be more mergers. But what we're not seeing is that these mergers are changing competitive landscape in any way. The players, the companies are getting larger, and we are getting larger ourselves, and have much, much larger product portfolio, full product portfolio across many dimensions with automotive, industrial, computing, IoT, so on and so forth. So we are formidable competitor ourselves today, but NXPI and Qualcomm merging together doesn't make NXPI any more scary or not scary. NXPI and Freescale merging together didn't change anything.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","If your question is about scale and our concern about that, we really don't see that as an issue. I think we've been asked that question from prior acquisitions as well. We believe we have the scale we need. There is nothing that another acquisition in its scale in some way creates a competitive disadvantage that we see.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It is not clear that Qualcomm's sales force had a similar focus in NXPI, and then they didn't have a sales force to call on all of the thousands of NXPI customers. as much of a distribution line. We didn't think Qualcomm had factories themselves where NXPI could leverage. So there were reasons for that acquisition, whatever Qualcomm's reasons were to diversify. It's not clear to us that in terms of the microcontroller and analog offerings of NXPI, the Qualcomm acquisition makes them anything different, which could be troublesome to us. We don't see that.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution of both in Microchip and with the Atmel business. The first question I have, Steve, you commented that as you've been executing with the Atmel products and the Microchip products in the channel, a competitor has made a move away from their demand creation initiatives with the channel. If that's favoring you, how long does it take for that positive to show up in the financials that we would see, recognizing that microcontrollers have design-in gestation cycle? Is that sometime later in fiscal 2017 or is that a tailwind for fiscal 2018's revenue?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We commented that that was a competitor in the channel.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Did he identify the competitor?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","No.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Okay. So, a large competitor redefined their distribution program where they essentially said that the distribution will only serve the fulfillment part of the business and they will not have the distribution be creating demand and giving them registration and then giving them the demand creation margins. So, since then, we have seen a substantial desire on the part of distribution to bond with Microchip and our combined product line is formidable, Microchip and Atmel combined. So we're getting a lot of that focus, and it will have the usual lead time of design-in, which is a year-and-a-half or so in this business, although there're always some shorter-term opportunities where either the product was designed on both sides or customer has the option to build a model A versus model B, and model A was designed with that company, model B's designed with us, and distribution promotes this model. So I think there is no negative we see coming out of this. We'll get some short-term and medium-term advantage, but a significant long-term advantage.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And then the follow-up is for Eric. Eric, you mentioned that there would be a 25 basis point reduction in borrowing cost. Is that for part of the debt that is currently outstanding or would that be on any future debt?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, that's the debt that is outstanding today. Future debt would all be based on what our debt-to-EBITDA is at that point in time. If we went and had a new borrowing next week that that rate would apply until we file our next 10-Q, and that's the point where we always have to calculate what the leverage is and what the borrowing grid would produce.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay. So what we need to do is look at that change in rate and the pace at which you're paying down debt and use those two inputs to derive our interest expense?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","That's right. And I can help you with that.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from [Mark Delaney] with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","This is Mark Delaney from Goldman. Congratulations on the good results and thanks very much for taking the question. The question was on the Atmel price increases, which the company has talked about taking some time to fully play out. Can you help us better understand what percent, either quantitative or qualitative, you think is already being recognized? Are you a quarter of the way through or half? Any sort of relative sense about how far along you are with getting those fully into the financial metrics would be helpful.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We're unable to provide further guidance on how far we are and how much more to go. Part of that could be competitive information and we don't want any misreading by the customers on how much more to come because at some customers where we've completely done, other customers we haven't even started. So, if you start to put the percentages on it without communicating with the customers, then it will create unnecessary concern in customers that we will be going back to them for further increases. So we cannot provide any further guidance on that.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. And then for a follow-up question, I was hoping to better understand some of the puts and takes to gross margin for the December quarter. You talked about some potential tailwinds around pricing and closing down the Micrel fab. Obviously, there'd be some reverse leverage from lower sales next quarter, so just help me just better understand the reason for gross margins being down a bit and what's offsetting some of the self-help gains around pricing and the Micrel fab?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I'd say for the current quarter, it's really a product mix. There's so many puts and takes with gross margins, but I think it's probably driven primarily by a product mix one quarter to the next. We had very good product mix in the September quarter and that changes a bit in the December quarter.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The Micrel fab impact is farther out in time.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Micrel fab closes in a couple of weeks and then it takes a little while to decommission it and all that. So Micrel impact is really more significant in the next quarter. I think a little bit of you're seeing also from Atmel it's still a lower gross margin than Microchips and driven by \u2013 I'm sorry, Atmel is lower gross margin than Microchip and driven by Atmel's mix in the current quarter, a little more consumerish, I think it's a mix when you mix it all together, it results into a slightly lower gross margin.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lena Zhang with Summit Redstone Partners.","Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations as well. Only one question. And, Steve, besides the \u2013 you mentioned that your larger competitors have switched channel program to fulfillment program and as well as the pricing on Atmel, give Atmel product gross margin up 400 basis points. And then looking at the overall September quarter gross margin up around less than 200 basis points from the last quarter, is that fair to say there was significant ASP erosion in the quarter?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","No.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","No, no. Atmel is less than half of our business, right?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yes.","Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Yes.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, there's 400 basis points improvement on Atmel's business, but you have to average it with the overall business.","Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Okay.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Gross margin was sequentially up both on core as well as Atmel. And the overall gross margin was up by a couple of hundred basis points?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think we can do the math. You could do the math. You're just really misunderstanding it. We didn't say there was a 400 basis points improvement on overall. It was 400 basis points on Atmel.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Right. And we did make the comment that the Microchip gross margins were up in the quarter.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Microchip, excluding Atmel.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And moving on, we'll take our last question from Chris Caso with CLSA.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Thank you. I'd just like to ask a follow-up on some of your previous comments regarding your intention to build up some cash for M&A. If you talk about how you balance that against some of the repayments of debt, I would guess that net debt is probably important if you're looking to do another deal, but if you can clarify that.","In addition, you've spoken in the past about some of the constraints from doing further M&A, one of which would be managing bandwidth. Obviously, your borrowing capacity would be the other. At what point do you think you would be ready to start contemplating doing something else?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, one thing I don't want anyone to read is that there is an acquisition tomorrow, we've got nothing on our plate, we are extremely busy with Atmel, we haven't done go-live, combining all these systems yet. We're doing that on January 1. We are 130% consumed. We can't do anything very short-term. So, my point simply was that rather than spending $500 million, it'll be actually more than that for the number of shares we issued in Atmel transaction will now be $600 million, $650 million. Rather than spending $650 million on buying the share back, which is really kind of a lost promise now, we're going to not do that and instead leave that \u2013 leave the balance sheet with lower leverage. So, when there is new acquisition, when we are ready to do something, when there is an opportunity available, we've got $650 million more available to go forward than the other way round. But there is really nothing happening short term.","When that happens, when we find the right deal, we're not going to do a wrong deal and we're not going to pay exorbitant prices that are not accretive and so on and so forth, we have always found at the right time the right deals. When we find the deal, then I'll find the money to do the deal. I'll find the money to do the deal. And next time, I'm not going to listen to your talk about leverage.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","To the Street's comments about leverage.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Not you personally.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Understood. Understood. As a follow-up, if we could talk a little about the utilization levels of the fab? I know there's a lot of moving parts there. You talked a bit about channel inventory, you talked about your own internal inventory both at pretty low levels. How does that affect utilization levels of the fab? And, I guess, the Micrel closure going forward over the next couple of quarters and maybe you could talk about the benefit of that to gross margins, if indeed that goes up?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I think that's all a positive wind on the back coming. So, as the Micrel fab closes and as you start to burn that 6-inch inventory, you have to start producing that product in an 8-inch fab, which means more demand for 8-inch products. The year has been good. We were up sequentially in the March quarter, June quarter, September quarter. So, our inventory, we just reported is 103 days of inventory, which is kind of not high by any standards. It's kind of lower by any standard we gave you before, which was more in the 115 days range.","And then the Atmel inventory, when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last year, seven, eight months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly where it's almost corrected, not across the board, but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected.","So, over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all three fabs, possibly, and that's really what you were asking. And when that starts to happen, then you have wind on the back. Now when you increase the wafer starts, the wafer cost comes down, but first it goes into inventory, first in\/first out and its real impact on gross margin is couple of quarters later when we ship that product. Does that makes sense?","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","It does. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, thank you very much for attending the conference call. We'll see some of you at the CSFB Conference here in our hometown, Scottsdale. So that's in early \u2013 late November. Thank you very much.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn things over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I want to remind investors that during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end market demand, and this is not how we manage our business.","As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue we earned from fulfilling end market demand. Therefore, along with the GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, using revenue based on end market demand, and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were $1.513 billion, just above the midpoint of our guidance, and up 24.4% sequentially from net sales of $1.217 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.7%, operating expenses were 23.4% of sales, and operating income was a record $579.3 million and 38.3% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $454.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.81, which was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.74.","On a GAAP basis, net sales in the September quarter were $1.433 billion. GAAP revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in the Microsemi distribution channel during the quarter, resulting in Microsemi distributor months of inventory being down to 2.6 months. We believe at the current levels, the distributors are holding the amount of inventory needed to support end market demand, and that the inventory levels are in line with the levels maintained by our distributors for our historical business.","GAAP gross margins were 48.1% and include the impact of $3.9 million of share-based compensation, a $184.4 million of acquisition-related and acquired inventory valuation and other costs, and $56.1 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels. Total operating expenses were $586.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $169.9 million, special charges of $18.2 million, $6.6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $37.5 million. The GAAP net income was $96.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share and includes one-time tax benefits of $115.6 million related to a variety of matters including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinement, and intercompany restructuring of intellectual property.","The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the September quarter, and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 to be 5% or less, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring of the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low. The transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi Group is expected to be about $364 million, was recorded last fiscal year, and will be paid over eight years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the quarter for the variety of reasons I discussed earlier.","Moving onto the balance sheet; our inventory balance at September 30, 2018 was $836.7 million, including a $120.1 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting [ph]. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had 117 days of inventory at the end of September quarter, which was down two days from the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were 37 days compared to 40 days at the end of June. As indicated earlier, we believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end market demand.","The cash flow from operating activities was a record $487.6 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $464.2 million. We paid down $501 million of total debt in the September quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $315.5 million. At September 30, our debt outstanding includes $3.1 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $2.733 billion of Term Loan B, $2 billion in high-grade bonds, and $4.481 billion of convertible debt.","Our net debt to EBITDA excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037, and is more equity like in nature, was 4.9 at September 30, 2018. Our leverage is higher than we originally projected, primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business, driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity in the month of June, as well as in the September 2018 quarter. As indicated earlier, we believe the distribution inventory correction for Microsemi is essentially complete. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payment to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our net leverage metrics are based on 12-month trailing EBITDA, which will continue to provide some headwinds due to the significant distribution inventory reductions which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end market demand for the past two quarters, as well as our guidance for the December 2018 quarter.","Capital expenditures were $72 million in the September 2018 quarter, we expect about $50 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $230 million to $250 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $47.2 million.","I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter, and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. As I review our product line performance, please bear in mind that the September quarter has a full quarter of contribution from Microsemi, while the June quarter only had a month of contribution from Microsemi. This along with the fact that Microsemi revenue only maps into four of the six product line reporting categories we have, while in some cases distort the quarter-over-quarter comparisons of revenue by product line.","Taking a closer look at microcontrollers; our microcontroller business was sequentially up 12.6% as compared to the June quarter. This benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter microcontroller revenue annualizes at almost $3.3 billion, putting us within striking distance in the next few years of the two industry players who are ahead of us in the 2017 microcontroller rankings. Our microcontroller portfolio continues to expand with several new product introductions, our roadmaps remain strong, and our designing funnel is robust. We see all these as positive indicators for future growth. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in the future.","Now moving to analog; our analog business was sequentially up 33.6% as compared to the June quarter. This too benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter analog revenue annualizes at over $1.75 billion, firmly in the Top 10 of analog semiconductor players. With Microchip 2.0 and our total system solutions approach, we expect to continue to grow and gain further analog market share.","Next up is our FPGA business, which came to Microchip through the Microsemi acquisition. Our FPGA revenue hit an all-time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel [ph] history. Our low power mid-range PolarFire family continues to garner strong market acceptance with revenue more than doubling sequentially as compared to the end market consumption in the full June quarter. Despite being a new product category for Microchip, we are optimistic about the prospects for the FPGA product line based on the highly defensible markets and applications they are designed into, as well as the intense design win focus and broad-based market application and customer focus requiring. These requirements are very similar to Microchip's microcontroller business requirements, and therefore, we expect the FPGA product line will very nicely leverage our capabilities.","Moving next to our licensing business; this business was sequentially up 40.3% as compared to the June quarter. We achieved an all-time record for our royalty revenue. Additionally, our results also benefited from the sale of a patent license for a specific set of patents that can be used in non-competitive fields of play. We did anticipate this patent license to close in the September quarter and included it in our guidance. We continue to retain indefinite rights for these patents for the fields of players that are of interest to us. Even without the patent license sale, the September quarter licensing business revenue was sequentially up from June. Let me share some background as to our thinking in regards to patent licensing.","We have inherited a substantial patent portfolio from the companies we acquired over the last 10 years. Several quarters ago, based on licensing request we were receiving, our licensing business unit embarked on a strategy to monetize certain patents, which have value to players in non-competitive fields of play. In all cases, we retained rights to use these patents in our products as well. The first results from this monetizing effort is what we saw in the September quarter results. There is a second such patent license sale for a specific set of patents which is in the advanced stages of negotiation, and is included in our guidance for the December quarter. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be a little lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.","Our memory business was sequentially down 3.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. And finally, our MMO, which stands for multi-market and other business was up 90.7% sequentially as we had a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in the September quarter, as compared to just a month in the June quarter. On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and Microsemi, our second quarter fiscal of 2019 non-GAAP end market demand revenue of $1.51 billion was split across the six product lines we report as follows: microcontrollers were 54.2%, analog was 29%, FPGA was 6%, memory was 3.1%, licensing was 2.5% and MMO was 5.2%. We expect this will be the approximate forward going revenue percentages by product line, and that quarter-to-quarter changes from here onwards will be relatively small.","Now an update on the Microsemi integration progress; the business unit integration continues to progress well. We are restructuring underperforming businesses, while implementing the strengths and best practices from both companies to drive improvements across the board. The key Microsemi business unit leaders we retained continue to run their businesses, and are adapting to the Microchip culture and business expectations. New product development and design win momentum are continuing to happen as planned. The sales integration is also progressing well. We have converted the Microsemi sales team to a Microchip's style non-commissioned sales approach. Teams from Classic Microchip and Microsemi are working collaboratively as one team to drive new opportunities and pursue product cross-selling opportunities. Our internal reference designs are increasingly taking advantage of our combined total system solutions approach. A comprehensive analysis of our new channels and channel partners from the Microsemi acquisition was completed, and we are making the adjustments required for an effective combined company approach.","The operations integration work is an enormously complex undertaking, as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions have taken place. Because of the size of the business and the absence of ERP integration by Microsemi, the business system and operational integration will be done in phases. The first phase for one of the business units went live on November 1 successfully, further phases have been planned with the quarterly cadence of go-live events for many quarters. We expect the overall operational integration will take about two more years to complete. From a factory standpoint, the initial plans for insourcing somewhat [ph] Microsemi was outsourcing have been completed, and prioritize actions to execute these plans have commenced.","In the G&A functions; we eliminated some more of the support organizational redundancies and more will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plans.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2019. I will then provide update on our progress at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2019.","Our September quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated non-GAAP net sales came in just above the midpoint of our guidance that we issued on August 9, 2018. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin was strong at 61.7% of sales. Microchip classic, non-GAAP operating margin was an all-time record. Consolidated non-GAAP operating profit, including Microsemi was 38.3% of sales and near the high-end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was an all-time record at $1.81 and near the high-end of our guidance. There was a strong EPS contribution from both, Classic Microchip and Microsemi, the accretion from Microsemi exceeded our original guidance of $0.15 for the September quarter. This was based on non-GAAP revenue which is based on distribution sell-through and is representative of real market demand. On non-GAAP basis, this was also over 112th consecutive profitable quarter.","Now let me provide you some update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First to distribution inventory; we had told you last quarter that we will complete a distribution inventory reduction in two quarters, September and December. I'm pleased to report that with a lot of work by the combined teams of Microchip and Microsemi, and in cooperation with the distributors, we almost completed the inventory reduction in one quarter. The distribution inventory at the end of September was 2.62 months, down from about 4 months prior to the closing of the acquisition. This level of inventory, we believe is the level distributors need to support end market demand and is in line with the level maintained by distributors for Microchip classic business. This was accomplished without any negative impact on distribution sales out, the non-GAAP net sales from Microsemi based on direct shipments and distribution sales out was an all-time record.","Second is termination of deals; since closing the Microsemi acquisition on May 29, 2018, we terminated deals, discounts and subsidies that were used prior to the acquisition in connection with sales into distribution and contract manufacturers. For example, we can sell the Aero supply assurance program concerning sales into the channel of end-of-life product. At acquisition close, there was approximately $47 million of inventory in distribution under this Aero supply assurance program. We won't take any inventory back, but we will not ship anymore into distribution under that program. We also canceled the interest subsidy there was offered to some distributors to compensate them based on the inventory they have. We also canceled the production incentive program under which there was a discount offered to contract manufacturers to take additional inventory. Cancellation of this program has had no negative impact on contract manufacturers willingness to purchase the product they need.","Finally, there with a number of OEM customers that were transferred to distribution and then the inventory shipped into distribution, this resulted in lower margin for Microsemi. As of today, we have transferred many of those customers that account for about $110 million of annualized revenue back to direct customers. So overall, we are pleased that we were able to reduce some Microsemi distribution inventory very rapidly. There was one business unit, called the high reliability discrete products business unit, where the inventory at the end of June was very high at 8.6 months. At the end of September, we had brought it down to 6.7 months. We are continuing to reduce the inventory for this business unit further. The shipments are now quite linear in the four quarters prior to being acquired by Microchip, about 57% of Microsemi's quarterly sell-in revenue were shipped in the last month of the quarter. In the September 2018 quarter, only 31% of sell-in revenue from Microsemi products were shipped in the third month.","Now, next is Microsemi internal inventory. It is obvious that as we reduce the distribution inventory, the inventories that Microsemi would grow substantially unless we took corrective actions in the factories and subcontractors by cutting production targets. And that is what we did, fortunately, a very large amount of Microsemi business was done from wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We aggressively cut wafer starts at the foundries and loadings at assembly test subcontractors.","Microsemi had several small fabs and assembly locations owned by Microsemi. We cut loadings in these factories quite substantially, some of them as much as 50%. We let go temporary workers in many of these facilities and implemented temporary plant shutdowns to control inventory. Microsemi did not produce a high percentage of their production site; so the gross margin impact was fairly small. We maintained over 61% overall gross margin for Microsemi, we believe that the underloadings of the factory has got somewhat counterbalanced by the discontinuance of all the discounts. But as I have said before, the results are going to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters. At the end of September, the overall inventory -- internal inventory at Microchip, including Microsemi was 117 days, down two days from 119 days at the end of June quarter. So we did a great job in controlling internal inventories.","Now, this may seem all too easy after the fact, but there was a tremendous focus and amount of work that went into reducing the distribution inventory. And at the same time, ensuring that our internal inventory does not balloon up. We have multiple joint teams from Microchip and Microsemi, some focused on distribution inventory reduction, others focused on controlling internal factory production and others managing reduction of foundry wafer starts and assembly and test loadings. So while addressing the inventory has provided some headwind on the distribution selling driven GAAP revenue, including sales to contract manufacturers, the non-GAAP revenue for distribution, which is based on sell-through has not been affected. I'm pleased that Microsemi business achieved a record non-GAAP net sales based on end market demand.","The second issue we highlighted last quarter was extravagance. In this area, we have been moving aggressively to implement Microchip's frugal expense culture. We have shutdown the executive floor at the Microsemi headquarter building, canceled the private jet account, terminated or sold many of the sport's sky boxes, canceled golf and auto racing sponsorships and substantially pruned many memberships. As we reduced inventory and spending, Microsemi business has continued to do well. This was our narrative from the beginning that Microsemi has very good engineering teams and has very good products. The customers sockets are sticky and there are good end market opportunities for the combined company.","Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With the distributor and contract manufacturing inventory reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi. So far, we are ahead of our original targets. I also want to provide you one more figure. In the September quarter, we paid $501 million of our debt. This was accomplished by squeezing all the cash out of nearly 100 subsidiaries around the world. We could not have done it without the new tax law. Despite the large debt pay down in the September quarter, the debt leverage has not moved, though, primarily because the EBITDA has dropped, driven by lower GAAP revenue of Microsemi and also some softness in the Microchip classic business.","I also want to provide you update on our Classic Microchip business, all of the issues that I highlighted last quarter, that was built into our guidance essentially came true. I had described four concerns. First, long lead times for some of the passive components. This issue did affect from sales as we expected, since the customers could not complete the whole kit. Number two, tariffs. While we were one of the first to highlight the risk of tariffs and trade war, this issue investor and analyst attention during the quarter for the whole industry. We saw a significant impact on our business during the quarter due to customer concerns about tenants and we saw a significant weakening of our bookings. We believe that tariffs and related customer concerns will continue to be an issue. Number three, ZTE. We saw some impact from not being fully able to ship to ZTE for both Microchip and Microsemi, despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE. And number four, Bitcoin. Our bitcoin business has essentially evaporated, it was about 1% of our business, supplying microcontrollers and power management products for the power supplies, as well as Ethernet controllers.","Now, I will provide you guidance for the December quarter. The guidance we provided for the September quarter, which reflected our caution on business conditions turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the December quarter. We see weak market conditions for automotive and industrial, our two largest markets. Automotive business is negatively impacted by emission testing bottlenecks in Europe as well as weakness in China. The industrial business is negatively impacted by tariffs. On the other hand, communication, data center and aerospace and defense businesses are seeing strength.","With all this commentary, we expect our total non-GAAP net sales to be down 5% to 10% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% and 61.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 24.9% and 25.4% of sales and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.6% and 36.6% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.49 and $1.64 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.","Q - Christopher Rolland","Hey guys, great quarter in light of some of the headwinds that we're having here, and great update on Microsemi as well. So Steve, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on some of the end markets there. You had a little bit more detail than others did perhaps on auto, maybe talk about industrial as well. And then some bright points maybe within data center and comps, maybe that's your optical business that you might be pointing to, any more details there would be great.","Steve Sanghi","If you look at the auto business, we highlighted two areas, one is, there was a new emission standard implemented in Europe, effective September 1. There was a 1-year notice on it almost from September 1 of the prior year, however, testing agencies couldn't build up the capacity to test all the car production. So there was a significant bottleneck for cars waiting to be tested which brought the European car production down. And the whole China economy has been weak due to various reasons, some incentives were taken away, the concerns about tariff in Chinese production and all sorts of other reasons, China automotive market has been weak.","In the industrial area, the concerns are mainly tariffs, both driven by Chinese end products coming to U.S. which have a 10% duty today going to 25% in January. So there are a lot of people concerned about whether they will be competitive or not in selling products in U.S., and because of weak Chinese economy, industrial is weak in China too. The three markets which are doing stronger are; data center, communication, and defense and aerospace. If I take them in the reverse order, defense and aerospace, I think after years of drawing down defense spending, the defense and aerospace spending has been on the way up. And we are very broadly designed-in into essentially every single weaponry system, every single aircraft, helicopters and others; so that part of the business is doing well.","The data center business, I think you probably have seen some other companies with higher exposure to data center, data center cloud, hyperscalers and all that, that part of the business has been stronger. So that business did well last quarter and is stronger relative to the automotive and industrial and other businesses. And third is the communication, I think we also see the communication business doing well.","Christopher Rolland","And you guys have talked about this potential weakness that we're seeing from most guys out there in the market a little bit earlier, some however haven't guided for much weakness at all. Do you think that perhaps they're going to see it a little bit later and you might be working through this process a little bit earlier? And then, are there any signs of stabilization in late October or early November?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we are not going to talk about what other companies have said or what may happen to other industry players. I think you should ask them. Regarding Microchip, we first saw some impact in June quarter. And what we were seeing in June based on that we had a fairly conservative guidance for the September quarter and most people didn't talk about it till the results for the September quarter. So we were four months earlier before we saw it. And that's not first time, numerous times in the past we have seen the impact of industry events about three, four months ahead of the others see it. And we seed early and we always end early. If we talk about the industry four months earlier, nobody tends to believe it, because nobody else is talking about it and you're not seeing it. And therefore we start talking about the industry, we just talked about some factors that were affecting our business. So it turned out we were correct again and everybody else saw it later.","And now on the other side, we always come out earlier but whenever we tell you that, that won't get believed either because others are not seeing it yet. So we are not fully ready to talk about the other end of the cycle yet.","Operator","We'll hear next from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","Eric, I think you had cited a goal of 0.7 turns of delevering for I believe for this fiscal year. Can you maybe talk about if that gets impacted at all with this environment and currently based on what you're seeing? And also maybe one for Steve, and I won't ask a follow-up after this. Microchip was usually up in March, I think mostly MSCC was just all over the place. Maybe could you help us think about how we can think about modeling March just from your initial read on what you've seen in the business?","Eric Bjornholt","Sure. So I'll take the deleveraging one first and then pass it back to Steve. But we made really good progress in terms of paying down debt as both Steve and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we took down $500 million worth of total debt and on a net basis $315.5 million. So did a really good job there of using all the cash that we could to pay down debt. We will continue to use substantially all of our excess cash generations after dividends to reduce our debt levels. And we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years.","Now with the correction of the Microsemi distribution inventory having a significant impact on our EBITDA in the June and September 2018 quarters and then combining that with our guidance for the December 2018 quarter, our trailing 12 month EBITDA will have significant headwinds over the next year. And our net debt to EBITDA will not trend down as fast as we had indicated back in August, but this is a very good cash flow business, like I said, we'll continue to pay down debt, but in the current quarter we probably expect that debt paydown to be somewhere in $160 million range, a broad range should be $150 million to $200 million, but we'll have to see how things trend here over the next few quarters to give you a longer-term forecast.","Harsh Kumar","Got it.","Steve Sanghi","I'll pick-up the second question you had which was regarding the March quarter. So I remind investors that when we bought Atmel, it was not a small acquisition, either. Atmel was about 40% to half of our business. And after we integrated Atmel, we didn't understand Atmel's seasonality for a while because companies on their own, their prior seasonality was based on sell-in, however, they work for the distributors, the whole end market mix was different. And after we had Atmel for the entire year or more than a year, we fully understood the impact of Atmel seasonality on our business to be able to guide properly. Same is the situation now with Microsemi. We don't fully understand Microsemi's seasonality. We haven't had a March quarter where the Microsemi in it. And we do not consider the March quarter on a Microsemi's clot to be a meaningful indicator for us regarding seasonality because that business was managed with a selling driven mentality, with a significantly high distribution inventory, our guidance will be based on real market demand.","And the end markets for Microsemi are quite different. They are stronger in defense, stronger in data centers, stronger in communication and almost no automotive, very little automotive and all that. So I'm not ready to talk about the March quarter in terms of guidance till we have some more experience on our belt in understanding their seasonality as well as being able to gauge the impact of the current correction when it is ending and how its impact would be in the March quarter.","Operator","We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I'll start with a clarification with respect to the strong performance on the Microsemi inventory cleanup in the quarter. Did that have a particular impact on any of the product segment revenues that you reported or was the impact spread about equally among MCUs, analog and other businesses?","Eric Bjornholt","So, it really did not have an impact on the sales-out activity that Ganesh talked about, breaking out by product lines. So it was really just more of correcting the inventory sitting in distribution. So I don't think there was really any end-market impact from the actions that we took.","Steve Sanghi","We basically, we haven't broken out the sell-in data by product line. We only have broken out sell-out data by product line and that did not change based on lowering the sell-in and cleaning up the inventory.","Eric Bjornholt","Yes. So, I mean, we have the sell-in data in our public filings and in our 10-Q, but that doesn't really give you an indication of where the distribution inventory drain was by product line.","Craig Ellis","There were a couple of references to accretion and I just wanted to clarify, what was the exact amount of Microsemi earnings accretion in the quarter? And Steve, are you retaining all the prior synergies and accretion targets, the $300 million in synergies as well as the $0.75 plus in year one, and $8 and I believe fiscal '20 earnings?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, we're not breaking out the exact numbers of Microsemi attrition because we kind of managing it as one company, but we gave you anecdotes that the accretion in the September quarter was higher than the $0.15 for the September quarter, we had originally guided. And we feel very confident that going out of the first year, the accretion will be higher than the $0.75 that we guided and we remain committed to a longer-term accretion of earnings per share of $8 that we guided before. This is a short-term impact based on this business cycle environment, whatever one, two, three quarters at last, it doesn't really have a long-term impact over a three, four years because usually the bounce back, will get you back to where you were.","Operator","From SunTrust, we'll hear from William Stein.","William Stein","First, really more of a housekeeping one. The share count was a little lower than expected in the quarter and in the outlook. Is that just owing to a share price and the treasury method accounting for average shares in the quarter? Or is there something else going on there?","Eric Bjornholt","No, that's exactly what it is. We post a schedule on our Investor Relations page under supplemental financial information that walks through what the share count approximately would be based on various prices. As you know, we have several convertible debt instruments outstanding and the share dilution from those has gone down with the stock price falling.","William Stein","And the other is to address the GAAP to non-GAAP revenue adjustment. I think it was $81 million in the quarter. You noted that the channel inventory from Microsemi now approximates the sort of heritage Microchip business channel inventory. So it sounds like maybe there is little bit more work to do, but it's mostly done. And so, while I understand that just the inventory is going to fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter after this $81 million delta that we saw in the quarter you just posted, going forward, should we expect this number to sort of fluctuate around zero or average around zero over time? Is that the right way to think about it?","Eric Bjornholt","I'll take a stab at answering that and then Steve or Ganesh can chime in. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we made in getting the Microsemi just the inventory down to 2.62 months, which is right in line with where Microchip has been historically. We really are not able to project what distributors are going to do, some of that is going to be based on environment, it's going to be based on working capital needs, it's going to be based on lead times, there are so many things that factor into it. We have 120 or so distributors that we work with worldwide. We don't manage our business in a way where we get that type of visibility from them and really we're driving for end-market demand forecast versus sell-in.","When it surprise me in an environment like this, that distributors are going to be very tight with our working capital. But again, for us to be able to provide any sort of forecast of what it's going to do is quite difficult and we don't feel we have capability to do that. Steve, do you want to add anything?","Steve Sanghi","What I would add is, we do not put any effort into managing our business to put the inventory into distribution. We put our entire effort into creating market demand which pulls the inventory out of the distribution and then allow the asset managers of the distribution to buy the product they need to serve the end market demand. So as the quarter is approaching, the quarter-end is approaching, we don't look at sales out is this and sell-in is this and we got to go make another $10 million of deal. So sell-in is lower than the sell-out or to hold back product because it's going to go up or lower. We don't manage both of those numbers. We only manage one number which is sales out.","And like I told you last quarter, the standard has changed, the GAAP standard is sell-in. I told you that before we disagree with it. But we have to report a GAAP sell-in number which we do, and we'll continue to do it. But all our measurements, all our bonus programs what Board manages us is to a market demand driven number that we report as a non-GAAP revenue. And sell-in would be whatever distributors want based on their own asset management, their cash flow needs, lead times, there are hundreds of things go into what they do with their inventory. And we don't manage that.","Operator","We'll hear now from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Steve, understanding, you don't want to talk about the March quarter and seasonality yet, just for the core business, your commentary about kind of cautious into December, what type of signals are you looking for in terms of distribution, our customers in terms of how far along we are for the correction here?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we interact with a large number of customers and distributors over the course of this quarter. And based on that collective engagement with hundreds, if not thousands of customers in all three geographies, US, Europe, Asia, we will have an assessment by the time we announce the December quarter results, which will be in early February. If there is a meaningful information that developed before that and gives us enough data points that we can kind of make a call, then we'll use the opportunity at one of the conferences to make comments on it. But fresh coming from the elections yesterday with 1% of precincts reporting, we cannot make the call on the election.","Craig Hettenbach","Understood. And I appreciate the color on the end markets, where you're seeing strength and weakness, any thoughts on consumer appliances, because that's the market that we've seen some potential slowing in China as well, do you have any thoughts there?","Ganesh Moorthy","So that part of the business appliance consumer part of the business is weak also. I cannot put it in the industrial. People who make wave conditioners and appliances and that's kind of industrial kind of business, you may call it consumer, but yes, that is we call so.","Operator","From Stifel we will hear from Kevin Cassidy.","Kevin Cassidy","With reference to China, have you seen any change in behavior on new designs where -- maybe because of the tariff and trade war if there's preference for non-US microcontrollers as an example, rather than Microchip?","Ganesh Moorthy","We haven't really seen a lot of impact in reality. There is lot of talk about it, but it's not changing the funnel size in any way, partially because very large portion of Microchip business is proprietary, such functionality with such low power or such features or performance for that really is not available in any local kind of Chinese parts, which are really fairly low end. So I don't think we have seen any meaningful difference in the funnel size or design activity. There is a lot to talk about it.","Steve Sanghi","Yes. And maybe I didn't understand the question directly, but tariff impact on our products directly is very, very small, right. It's the products that our customers are building with our products where the tariff applies. So I think it's probably too early for us to see any real impact on the design side, Kevin. If they were to use the Chinese microcontroller or analog part to build their end product appliance or washers and dryers whatever that will have duty also coming in here. So not designing a Microchip product does not abate the duty coming into US. And that is a bigger impact.","Kevin Cassidy","Right. It's just more whether it's going to anti-US, view in the design point of view, even if it's an STMicro [ph] something from Europe, rather than the US-based, that's what I was trying to get.","Steve Sanghi","I think your question is the right one and we hit that, but like I said, fortunately we're not easy to design up.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Steve, relative to the industrial weakness should calling out tariffs. I know this is probably an impossible question to answer, but I'm going to ask your opinion anyhow. To what extent do you think customers are reacting to the 10% tariff that's already been levied? And to what extent do you think that they're actually trying to be anticipatory to the raise to 25% come in the beginning of the year, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether or not you think there's another sheer to drop or not? And then my second question, you did a great job kind of talking about the distribution inventory at Microsemi. I'm kind of curious about direct customer inventory. What did you see as the quarter unfolded? Was there any meaningful adjustments you needed to make there those behind you and to the extent they might be behind you, could there be a potential tailwind which I think you referred to on the last conference call once this inventory depletion was done.","Steve Sanghi","So let me take the first one first, which is a tariff question. So what's happening is as the percentage tariff and the products which are -- we've tariffs on keeps moving, it is kind of creating waves in customer sentiment. Originally, back in June-July time frame when there were some tariffs ready to go on in August, some people will try to get ahead of it, build the product, so they bring it to US and avoid the tariff, others will hold back production, they want to draw down their inventory, because they don't really know whether they'll be able to pass the tariff to the customers or they will agree that entire tariff.","So it kind of create some waves both ways and that was for the 10% tariff. And through the quarter of September, customers were essentially cutting down production, drawing down their inventory, because they felt that it will be uncompetitive passing on the tariff to US customers who had a choice to buy the product made in Taiwan, made in Singapore, made in Vietnam, made in Mexico or wherever. And now, very recently we're hearing the talk that the expectation many of the customers had was heading toward the elections, the whole thing we're going to get settled. You may recall at the UN, Trump was talking so bad about Canada that Canada was cooperating and all that, and there may be an agreement with Mexico only. One week later they signed an agreement announced the agreement with Canada, so the thought was similarly few days before the election there will be settlement with China and so kind of people who are holding back. Well, that didn't happen. And now the feeling is I don't think the settlement is closed.","So now some of the customers are thinking tariffs are going to go to 25% and we should pull in and built some of the stuff and bring to US at 10% tariff and then bringing to 25%. So you could see that the waves moving all over the place and 50,000 customers we might have in China, not all aligned. It's very noisy, it's very hard to make decisions and we had lead times are short and we're responding to every customer and they're signing as we see it. So I don't know if that answers your first question.","John Pitzer","No, that's helpful. And then just on the direct customer inventory situation of Microsemi?","Steve Sanghi","On the direct to customer, the inventory we saw on the direct customer side was with contract manufacturers, because contract manufacturers is considered OEM business, it's a direct business, it's not through distribution. There was really not much inventory in the direct customers that we saw. And we wouldn't know it either, I mean, you don't know every customers inventory, but the way the deals were made with the discounts were given were to the contract manufacturers under a program called Production Incentive Program; so we can fill that program.","And as we cancel that program, contract manufacturers only started taking what they need for their needs and they drew down their inventory.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Danely","Steve, I know you're not going to comment on March seasonality. If hypothetically speaking if March revenue was down, would you be able to keep OpEx flat to down ?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we definitely will have the March OpEx down, not even flat to down, will be down, because we are still continuing to reduce Microsemi expenses as we do integration. And if March quarter is down as we're supposing, bonuses would be lower, so bonus approval will be lower. Yes, so I would say in that situation, March expense will not be flat, they will be down.","Christopher Danely","And then for my next question, any sort of comparisons on this correction versus previous corrections? Are you seeing anything in common or this completely new?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think that's more of your department than and mine, but...","Christopher Danely","I'm just newest as you...","Steve Sanghi","In 2015, we saw this impact, I believe in August-September time frame. And we made a call I believe in late September time frame that we see China slowing down. It was driven by China and nobody else was seeing it and by -- and then when the numbers came out and numbers were cut, and they were cut again and everybody was down as much. And most stocks went down lower than they had gone down that day when we had made the call. So everybody was about four months behind. Same thing is happening this time. I think we saw that impact three to four months behind everybody else, so that is common. But what's driving it today versus what was driving it back then, I think the reasons are a little bit different, tariffs, maybe lead time becoming shorter, some are same, some are different, tariff is a new phenomenon.","Operator","We'll hear now from Vivek [ph] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","Steve, for the first one, can you give us some more real-time sense on production plants? Are you still looking to reduce them further versus seasonality or do you think they have kind of stabilized at these levels?","Steve Sanghi","So if you look at Chris Danely's question, you have to make an assumption on March. We cut back production quite a bit, with that, the internal inventory is in good control. We actually -- internal inventory went down by a couple of days. So, if the business is stable from here, if this quarter marks the bottom, then factory start building back slowly. If there is a further downside, which was an assumption possibly Chris was making -- I don't know if he was making that assumption, then you have to adjust to the reality.","Unidentified Analyst","And on the OpEx side, if my math is right, so you had $354 million on non-GAAP OpEx in September, I think December, you are guiding to $352 million, so kind of a flattish. Why are we not seeing more cost synergies? And -- or does it just mean we will see them later on?","Eric Bjornholt","Well, we took a lot of costs out early. I think if you were to combine the Microchip and Microsemi models from back in March or even a year ago, you're going to see that significant expense has been taken out. And that doesn't mean that there still not more to come. But I think we're actively managing that. Our OpEx came in significantly lower than our guidance for the quarter that we just completed. And we're managing based on the environment that's presented to us and I think we're doing a good job of that.","Unidentified Analyst","And just one quick housekeeping; I think, Eric, you said tax rate under 5%, I believe in the past it was between 3% to 4%. So, just for modeling purpose, should be more like 3.5% or 4.5% for the next one or two years? Thank you.","Eric Bjornholt","Well, when we gave a 3% to 4% before, that was kind of the short-term and we've got now questions coming in, in terms of what it's going to be over the next few years. And it's not a perfect science to forecast this but under 5% or 5% or less is where we're at today, it's not saying it can't be 3.5% but that's a pretty tight range.","Steve Sanghi","I think you're modeling 100 plus subsidiaries around the world and varying tax rates in various countries and interest payments and deductions and all these taxes and it should kind of average of all that, it's not a perfect sound, so it can change based on mix.","Operator","Moving on to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","The first question, I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the trade-offs that you've made with Microsemi's business now that you've had it under your wing for a longer period of time. It sounds like there's been several efforts taken to improve gross margins and I think that business had run in the low 60s on a stand-alone basis. With all the changes, some of the product pruning and that changed things along those lines, do you think it gets to above that 63 range that you're guiding for on a combined basis or that were just toward that higher end once the utilization rates normalize? And related to that, maybe you can help us think about, has there been any share shifts or the size of product pruning that you may have done given some of these changes that you're making to the business model?","Steve Sanghi","I think, Mark, one mistake most people make in looking at Microsemi gross margin is that day-to-day acquisition of a company called Vectron which closed in late November, early December timeframe. It had gross margins in the mid-30s and was $100 million revenue. And so, its impact was really never seen by investors in a non-GAAP basis. December quarter was fairly short just one month. And then March quarter, we announced the deal on March 1. So March quarter was really never fully announced based on a non-GAAP.","Mark Delaney","They filed the 10-Q?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, they filed the 10-Q.","Mark Delaney","But didn't have a conference call\u2026","Steve Sanghi","But didn't have a conference call. So you wouldn't really know the non-GAAP margin taking away all these charges and everything else that acquisitions do. So Microsemi gross margin wasn't 63% driven by all those acquisitions margin was below 60%. And so we have already improved some and we'll continue to improve the gross margin, but looking for the gross margin to go over 63% would be quite a stretch right now.","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, so we -- as you said, have margin improvements programs that are in place and we still have confidence in the combined long-term model of 63%, this last quarter, we were at 61.7%. So it's not like we're light years away from that but --","Steve Sanghi","We got to get the factories to full production again because of the inventory correction as you ship less to distribution, all that inventory stays in house unless you cut production, so we did. And we take the under-absorption in the current quarter, we don't put it into -- we don't capitalize it into the inventory. So as the production starts going back, you will have some accretive effect on gross margin.","Mark Delaney","For the second part of that question, obviously there is a different focus on the types of businesses Microchip will be participating with there, but can you just help us think about the scope of revenue that you may not participate in any more either because you're focusing on -- and there are set of product lines, any share shifts that we should be contemplating things along those lines, so we can think about the right revenue run rate for that business once we adjust for some of these inventory dynamics that have gone on the last couple of quarters?","Steve Sanghi","We said that before we are going to keep and we like all the businesses. The combined Microsemi all businesses together, P&L is very good. There are product lines which are lower gross margin, there are product lines which are higher gross margin than average, there are product lines that grow less than average, there are product lines that are growing more than average. Microchip classic is no different. Our gross margins are lower in certain Microchip businesses but mix and match overall gross margin is excellent and that is the case with Microsemi. Every business is accretive and we're not going to offload a business just because it's a lower gross margin than the average. If it's accretive and growing and adding and providing additional attach is a part of the total system solution. So if all the other things are working, then it's a good Microchip product.","Eric Bjornholt","And every business unit leader that we have is tested and not just growing the revenue but improving their gross margin and operating margins over time. And within the Microchip system, we work together to make that happen.","Operator","We'll move next to Krysten Sciacca with Nomura.","Krysten Sciacca","I just wanted to follow-up on the OpEx question from before. It looks like the OpEx from this quarter came in a little bit lower than expected. And I'm just wondering if that was just due to better than expected execution on synergies or was there something else, going on in the quarter there that we should be thinking about?","Steve Sanghi","There was nothing else going on. Although, we would say that since we saw the effect of this downturn coming much earlier than anybody else, we hunker down earlier. We can sell majority of the open wrecks, we cut back on capital, we canceled firm orders that we had in capital to the extent we were able to cancel them and that's we slipped them out. We hunker down and we kind of batten down the hatches.","Eric Bjornholt","We ask our employees to treat the spending as if it's their own money and do that on a global basis and it has very good results. So I think Steve is right. We just got out ahead of this quicker.","Krysten Sciacca","And then just moving to the inventory question from Microsemi and how you completed that about a quarter earlier, then you stated on the prior call for the most part. What exactly caused that faster, that correction to happen faster than expected? Was there something in particular that Microchip did, or was it just better end demand, or what was kind of driving that for us?","Steve Sanghi","I think, especially when you buy new business, you're in lot to learn for that business. You're getting to know the people that are concerned with employees regarding what Microchip could do with various businesses. Let me get this in, various analysts write about various businesses that we will sell out, we should sell; and I always ask you please don't do that because you create problem for us. The employees of that business read those reports and they get concerned that their business is maybe sold or not get focused on. And we have said that we're going to keep all the businesses, but every time you look at, some analysts will make this speculation why data center business doesn't fit with Microchip or Opto business doesn't fit with Microchip or something else doesn't Microchip; all that does is creates concern for our customers and creates concern for our employees.","So what I'm saying is; we are working very hard on all these items, learning the businesses, keeping the customers at peace, talking to the employees, learning the inventory, and when such a large challenge comes up like the inventory, then it just takes an enormous amount of energy forming the teams and focusing the teams to go clean up the inventory. It also depends on how in the mix that inventory was. If that inventory was highly out of mix then you have to continue to ship additional products for which there is demand, and if there is lot of slow moving inventory that we call sludge, then that will take much longer time. And in certain business units, the inventory was in good mix, in certain other business units, inventory was not as good of a mix.","So basically, huge amount of work, the combined teams are working together, creating a goal for everybody to clean up this inventory faster than the two quarters we guided to and I think that's where we are. And also working and getting cooperation from the distributors. It's just lot of groundwork, there is not much magic there, it's just a lot of hard work.","Eric Bjornholt","Yes. And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, there is still a business unit or two, that's inventory is higher than we'd like it to be and it will come down overtime. And there may be a business unit or two, that's inventory is too low, and these things kind of balance each other out. So we think at 2.6 months, we're in a very good position today.","Steve Sanghi","And in this business unit, number one, the inventory is very high over 8.6 months. Clearly, there was a lot of excess inventory and when you build that much inventory, then inventory also tends to age and gets out of mix, we shipped such a high amount of inventory and customer demand shifts. So lot of the inventory then becomes very slow moving and takes time to correct.","Eric Bjornholt","I guess I'll give kudos to all the business units that were involved, the sales and distribution organization, our distributors, the planning folks, that goes with this, just -- it was a very large team, and everybody did a good job of executing.","Steve Sanghi","There was also $110 million of product that we shifted back from distribution to direct and customer-by-customer and distributor-by-distributor, whichever the pair was, the distributor shipping to customer, you had to go -- work that relationship and convince a customer and convince a distributor, distributor going to lose that business to direct customer will ship it directly, makes sure distributor cleans out their inventory, so the new business and Microchip ships and creating accounts for those customers, receivables, learning where the product has to be shipped some places, sometime it goes into hubs of distributors, sometimes there are multiple locations, all that challenging task by the shipping teams and marketing teams and sales teams; it's just purely a guess when we first talked to you regarding how long would it take. I have to tell you two quarters and get it done in one quarter, rather than tell you one quarter and takes two quarters.","Krysten Sciacca","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Raymond James, we'll go to Chris Caso.","Chris Caso","Just a question with regard to customer inventory levels, and I'd say, it's probably more pertains to the Microchip classic business. How much of the slowdown that you're seeing now, do you attribute to some of the demand function, issues that you talked about as opposed to just customers holding too much inventory and typically when we've seen the slowdowns in the past, it's some combination of the two, do you think about it any differently at this time around?","Steve Sanghi","Well, when customer buys less product, you're unable to differentiate whether that's a purely inventory correction or his demand is slower. It always tends to be a combination. If you're building a 100,000 widgets a week, then you have certain amount of inventory at you're loading dock, in your factory floor, some in raw material, some in work in process, a certain amount of inventory. If your demand drops, because of your tariff concerns, let's say, you only want to build a 90,000 widgets, then the entire inventory in your structure divided by 90 is going to become more weeks of inventory than at 100. And then when you draw it down, you could call it inventory correction, you can call it because of the lower demand, I don't know how you separate it.","Chris Caso","Understood. As a follow-up, if you could talk about the linearity of your order rate as you proceeded through the quarter and into October. And I assume that that the order rates have slowed down since we last spoke in August, but have they sort of step down to a certain level and then stabilize that level given the uncertainty about tariffs and such, you spoke about or did they continue to worsen on a month-on-month basis?","Steve Sanghi","The order rate slowed down and stayed pretty constant at the lower level and have recently bounced back, partially because lead times are fairly short, so they got to place the orders for December and January. They don't need to place orders for next June, but they do need to place the orders for the next quarter. So the order rate, as you said, slowed down, but has recently bounced back up.","Chris Caso","In the month of October?","Ganesh Moorthy","In the month of October, yes.","Operator","We will hear next from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Just wondering on deleveraging, how you changed, are you accelerating that? What's -- how are you looking at that?","Eric Bjornholt","So I tried to answer that on an earlier question, but essentially our deleveraging is going to be at a slower pace than what we had originally guided to the Street. We've got headwinds of very low EBITDA in both June and September, due to discretion inventory reduction. We were having a down quarter this year at the midpoint of guidance. We're going to be down 7.5%. And that just have an impact and is going to stay with us now for 12 months, because this debt calculations or EBITDA calculations are all 12 month trailing. So the cash flow from the business is going to be high, but if you look at our accounts receivable balance, it's down $120 million quarter-on-quarter, and that translates to cash. So it's going to take us some time, but all of our cash, really all our significant cash in excess of what we need to run the business and pay dividends is going to be used to pay down debt.","And with that, we will reduce the debt balance, but the EBITDA is going to be something that sticks with us for the next year.","Unidentified Analyst","Getting fast some of the near-term tariff issues, the lack of visibility into the March quarter and first half, let's say, any thoughts, concerns on microcontroller has been, especially as you look at automotive where does content go? And just wondering -- just want to get your thoughts on how you look at that? Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, you want to take that?","Eric Bjornholt","Ganesh, had to run to catch a flight.","Steve Sanghi","Oh, he had to catch a flight. So I think we are not concerned about the long-term prospects of microcontroller, analog or any of our businesses. Our fundamental frame is being able to sell total system solution into a customer socket, whether it's automotive, whether it's industrial, with microcontroller, analog connectivity products Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, LoRa. And now where there are lots of Microsemi products, including discrete products, FEPS and diodes and RF and other products. I think, there is fundamentally no concern about long-term Microchip, and the design win funnel and all that, are very, very healthy. I think, we're just talking about this impact, some from the tariff, and some from the slowdown in the business. You could go back, there was an earlier question, how it is different, or same as the 2015 cycle?","And in that 2015 cycle, some of the assumptions were, like this thing is over. The industry just goes away, and all these things don't get designed in, and you can see how the business bounced back, and we had record quarters and record years and outstanding market share gains and everything else. So there is no long-term concern here, it's a short-term.","Operator","We'll hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Maybe just touching on some of the pockets of strength in the business. In aerospace and defense, it's obviously very sticky, very high profitability segment; it sounds like near-term it's kind of doing well. In order for you guys to sort of take advantage of this very profitable area, how much effort is required to get your MCU and analog products Mil\/Aero, Rad Hard qualify, is there a lot of work to be done here? Or is the core Microchip team already engaged in cross-selling?","Steve Sanghi","So there is a lot of work underway. There was a small aerospace and defense business that we have acquired as part of the Atmel acquisition which was headquartered in France. And they did business largely with French aerospace companies, and didn't have any market share in U.S. And after acquiring them, in the last year and a half or so, we've been putting efforts, we expanded the charter to take Microchip standard microcontroller, analog and memory products, and make them Rad Hard, recharacterize them to the needs of military and aerospace with broad temperature ranges and all that. So all that work has been underway for the last two year or so in militarizing our products.","Microsemi brings even just a much, much higher level of expertise in that area, and about 10x to 15x larger business than Atmel had in aerospace and defense. So in our integration, we have combined the Atmel's aerospace and defense business together with the microspace, aerospace and defense business as one business unit. And that business unit is accelerating, taking Microchip products to market in that segment. So that effort is about a year old, and is really getting significant boost right now. But we're not shipping core Microchip products in military for revenue today. Any Microchip products going into aerospace and defense sector, are still standard commercial products that are bought from distributors, and just kind of use standard commercial product.","In some non-sensitive applications, aerospace and defense is allowed to use standard commercial products. The military products, rad-hard products, is an effort under way, but it's not making revenue today.","Harlan Sur","And then in the FPGA segment, you guys drove record revenues, obviously the Microsemi team built a strong Mil\/Aero leadership franchise there. And I think Ganesh talked about some of the new opportunities with the mid-range PolarFire family, which is more for kind of like multi-market applications, but sounds like overall the business is doing well. Can you guys just give us a sense on how strongly the FPGA business is growing on a year-over-year basis?","Steve Sanghi","So, I don't have a year-over-year comparison, some, but it won't be valid, because it will be a sell-in by putting in your high channel inventory versus sell-through that we're measuring. So that's why we said based on a sell-through basis, the numbers were a record. It was all-time record. And I don't have a year-over-year comparison, since we haven't had the business for a year. But the business is doing very well. It's doing very well in defense and aerospace, it's doing very well in the multi-market. It has a very good design and funnel. The next-generation architecture, which is Gen5, is just going into market and just introducing at the sample level. And there is a significant demand pull on that. So I think we are very optimistic about that business.","Operator","We'll go next to Jefferies' Mark Lipacis.","Mark Lipacis","Steve, a number of the contract manufacturers with the global footprint, have talked about some of their customers already shifting manufacturing outside of China and accelerated core activity with our customers to do as much. I was wondering, if you were noticing that any evidence or anecdotes on that front? And to the extent that you think that might be causing some near-term disruption? That's all I had. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","You're very correct. We are seeing that, too. So two things are happening. One, if there are two sources of production, one in China and one outside of China, then some attempt is being made to take the Chinese production and sell it to Europe and Asia, and take the non-Chinese production and ship it to U.S. This way you can optimize and not pay any duties. Two challenges in that; number one, it's lot of manual work and most people aren't set up to really differentiate the product where it should go, but manually, and then writing some automation, it's really being done. But it's not perfect, because in many cases the U.S. demand is not exactly equal to the non-Chinese production, and Europe and Asia demand isn't equal to Chinese production, so there are still problems.","So to solve that problem, you're correct, there are many customers that are moving Chinese production to outside of China, but they are rapidly running into capacity issues. Where the outside factories are full, there was a little bit space, and they're now full, and there is lot more to be transferred from China but there is no place to put it till they really expand capacity, build more square footage and all that, and that's a slow process. So, yes, we're seeing that.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn things back to Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","We want to thank all of our customers and analysts for your patience and for your understanding. I think this has been a tough four months here, but I think we've done a lot of good work in cleaning up the Microsemi inventory. And at the same time, it's really the first acquisition whose timing was such that the wind is not on our back, we did number of other acquisitions and the timing was great. Here, along with the Microsemi inventory challenges we're also facing this downturn in the business, and so we're dealing with the dual challenges. But I think we posted a pretty good quarter, and despite sequentially down guidance, I think we're managing the inventory very well, the internal inventories in very good shape. Overall, gross margin and operating margins are still very, very good. And we look forward to really getting through these issues and getting back to our long-term $8 earnings target.","So, thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you all for joining us."],"15032":["Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call February  7, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Eric Bjornholt \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Ganesh Moorthy \u2013 President and Chief Operating Officer","Steve Sanghi \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Analysts","Craig Hettenbach \u2013 Morgan Stanley","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Craig Ellis \u2013 B.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve, Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page on our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were a record $881.2 million and they were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 0.8% sequentially from net sales of $873.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.8% in the December quarter and significantly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was 56.9%.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25% of sales significantly below the midpoint of our guidance range of 26.7%. And non-GAAP operating income was an outstanding 32.8% well above the midpoint of our guidance of 30.15% and very close to reaching our prior long-term operating model goal of 33%, which we had previously guided investors that we would achieve in the March 2018 quarter. Non-GAAP net income was a record $246.5 million resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.05, which was $0.145 higher than the midpoint of our guidance of $0.905, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 64.9% as compared to the same quarter last year.","On a GAAP basis net sales were $834.4 million, GAAP net sales were $46.8 million lower than non-GAAP net sales because for GAAP accounting purposes we began recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors. On October 1, 2016, an inventory sitting in the distribution channel on that date was not recognized as revenue in our GAAP financial statement when it was subsequently sold by the distributors. Sales to all Atmel distributors are now being recognized based on sell-through revenue recognition.","GAAP gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 55.8% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share based compensation, $26 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $12 million in acquired inventory valuation costs and $3 million of manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Micrel fab.","Total operating expenses were $347.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $82.8 million, share based compensation of $18.7 million, $4.2 million of acquisition related and other costs, and special charges of $20.9 million consisting primarily of charges associated with our acquisition and integration activities. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition related charges and the related tax impact, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $107.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share.","In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 28.5%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. The large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate relates to the differences in the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balances at December 31, 2016 was $419.6 million. Microchip had 104 days of inventory at December 31, 2016, up 1 day from the end of the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 31 days and at the same level as the September quarter.","The cash generation in the December quarter excluding our acquisition and divestiture activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $258.8 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $699.7 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.683 billion, up $5 million from the prior quarter levels. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $230 million to $250 million in the March quarter.","We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt to EBITDA ending the December quarter at 2.47. This is down from 2.91 at the end of September quarter. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be under 2.1 by the end of the fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2017 and that's well below the last forecast that we provided to investors of 2.35.","Capital spending was approximately $15.7 million in the December quarter. We expect about $38 million in capital spending in the March quarter. And overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $90 million compared to our previously communicated FY 2017 forecast of $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities, for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","Deprecation expense in the December quarter was $29.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you Eric and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with how each of our product lines performed in the December quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony are producing differential growth results.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines. Starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business in the December quarter held up well in a seasonally slower quarter and was up 0.3% sequentially as compared to the September quarter, setting a new record in the process. We continue to experience broad based growth in our business as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses met or exceeded our expectations for the December quarter.","Customers using microcontrollers originating from Atmel continue to gain confidence in microchips commitment to those products and began to see how powerful the combined microcontroller roadmaps going forward are. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel and expect this to drive future growth as these designs progress in to production over time.","We have also seen many examples, of how the joint sales and business unit teams are able to find and win more opportunities using our broader basket of analog connectivity security and memory products to garner a larger share of the available content in an application.","This in turn we expect will help drive incremental growth over time. In all our product lines. Microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue, represents 63.1% of microchips overall revenue in the December quarter. We remain pleased with the performance on the competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel\u2019s portfolio.","We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Our Analog business was up 1.4% sequentially in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and also set a new record in what is normally a seasonally weak quarter.","At well over $900 million in annualized revenue our analog business represented 25.9% of Microchips overall revenue in the December quarter. As I mentioned earlier we are successfully finding more opportunities to attach Microchips vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at multiple customers and application.","This effort will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed signal, power interface timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our Analog business, as we march relentlessly towards making Analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.","Moving to our memory products, our memory business was about flat in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter we introduced a new memory solution called an EERAM, which offers unlimited endurance and safe data storage should a power loss occur. That is ideal for a broad range of applications. This gives us one more opportunity to add to the content we can win in our customers applications, as we deliver total system solutions to them.","A quick summary of where we are with the Atmel integration. We had already made significant progress for the business unit integration by the end of the September quarter and completed this activity in the December quarter. Our sales integration continued to progress well, with extensive cross training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partners sales teams.","The sales integration is now largely complete, with pricing changes we have discussed before continue to roll out during the quarter and we will have further changes that take place in the March and June quarters.","On January 1, 2017, we went live with Atmel\u2019s business systems transitioning to Microchips business systems. This was a significantly complex activity to plan and execute, the transition is going as planned but the small number of normal issues that are being rapidly resolved. And where we are at this point of the transition to our systems is about where we have been at the same point with prior acquisitions, which is quite positive given the size and complexity of the Atmel business and business systems.","The integration work to take advantage of our internal manufacturing capability to lower the cost of packaging and testing products that are currently outsourced has just started and will continue for many quarters to come. All in all the third quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plan. Our profuse thanks go out to our many employees across the globe, who have gone above and beyond that contribute to the rapid integration. Their tireless efforts on multiple fronts helped deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the tremendous results from the Atmel integration.","Steve Sanghi","Thank Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2017. And then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration of Atmel.","Our December quarter financial results were extremely strong. I would say that we hit the ball out of the ballpark. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share all exceeded the high-end of our updated guidance.","Non-GAAP earnings per share, was an all time record and was $0.145 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. And up 64.9% from the December quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage, and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions.","I want to thank all the employees of Microchip including acquired employees from Micrel, Atmel and other acquisitions worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 105th consecutive profitable quarter.","As I reflect on the calendar year 2016, we had outstanding financial results in every quarter in closing out the calendar year with explosive earnings was a befitting tribute to the year. In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our 200-day assessment of what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses. Today I will provide a 300-day update on where we are in correcting these weaknesses, and this will probably be the last update on that topic.","First, lack of pricing discipline. Average Atmel prices continue to go up and we are seeing it in the improving gross margin. Atmel gross margin improved another 50 basis points sequentially. We mentioned in the last conference call that on the distribution front we caught a lucky break as one of our largest competitors has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and terminating the registration program under which the distribution earned higher margins for demand creation.","This is continued to have a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and it increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip. We now have a long list of customer designs sockets where the distribution has converted the design from this large competitor to Microchip.","Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses which routinely ran over 40% of sales. We have now corrected Atmel\u2019s operating expenses, as well as a culture related to operating expenses. Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins, this has now been corrected as we are aligning Atmel sales focus to be consistent with that of Microchip. Number four, accountability, Atmel had a culture of poor accountability with a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability. We are rapidly changing that culture.","In our presentations, communications and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip management is accountable. As of now, approximately 90% of the employees of Atmel are only common bonus program with Microchip employees. Number five, poor team work. Atmel did not have a culture of team work, bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity.","At Microchip 100% of our non-Atmel employees are on a bonus program and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand production labor employees are on equity program. With Microchip managers teaching them role modeling of our culture and with 90% of Atmel employees on common bonus program with Microchip employees we are now all pulling the ship together and in the same direction.","And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 10 months nearly 100% of Atmel employees have gone through at least some training class at Microchip. We are continuing to put Atmel sales and field applications engineers through a two-week extensive training that we call boot camp in which we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, culture, and align them with our goals and reward system. Rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior system at Microchip and the results are improving rapidly.","So with that, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal third quarter. While we will refrain from providing line by line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip to ahead of those nuggets. We achieved an all-time high operating margin percentage in our core Microchip business. On Atmel, the gross margin improved by another 50 basis points sequentially. Regarding Atmel's operating expenses I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expenses are now in range of the Microchip model and has been corrected.","With the combined effect of better than expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, the Atmel business achieved operating margins of over 26% of net sales. Which is the highest operating profit percentage ever achieved in Atmel\u2019s history. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.21 per share versus our guidance of $0.13 to $0.17 per share.","Now despite the significant initial skepticism from investors and analysts about our ability to realize synergies, we had forecasted from Atmel, we were always confident in our assessment of synergies and our results have shown that we were actually extremely conservative in our initial projection. By any measure our December quarter results are stellar. We are also proud to have crawled back up to 32.8% operating profit percentage for the combined company and within a smidgen of our long-term model of 33% operating profit, which we initially guided to be three to four years away at the time of Atmel acquisition announcement.","I want to again thank the worldwide employees of Microchip, including acquired employees of all of our acquisitions for delivering a stellar and a record calendar year 2016. Before we go into March 2017 quarter guidance, I want to bring up one point. Our integration of business systems for Atmel was originally scheduled for November 1, 2016. However, due to extreme complexity of business systems in our largest acquisition ever we had to push out the go live of our business systems integration to January 1, 2017, a two months delay.","As a result, several of our customers requested early shipment of their product that was originally requested to be delivered in the early part of January. We believe the impact from these customer requests added approximately 1% to our December quarter revenue. Ordinarily we attempt to schedule these business system integrations in the middle of the quarter to minimize impact on our quarterly revenue results.","As a result, investors should view the true end market demand for our products in the fiscal third quarter to be about 1% lower than our reported GAAP and non-GAAP net sales. And our fiscal fourth quarter 2017, true end market demand to be about 2% higher than the midpoint of our GAAP and non-GAAP net sales guidance.","So now let's go into the non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We expect total net sales to be between minus 1% to plus 3% sequentially. Again, without the customer requested early shipments in December quarter. The guidance for net sales would have been plus 1% to plus 5% sequentially. But we will report and compare net sales against our true non-GAAP guidance of minus 1% to 3% sequentially.","We expect gross margin to be between 58% and 58.5% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 24% and 25% of sales and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 33% and 34.4% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.01 and $1.11 per share with a midpoint of $1.06. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from at Atmel of between $0.18 and $0.22 per share.","Now last quarter, we increased the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 for fiscal year 2017. With $0.44 of accretion already achieved in three quarters, the $0.50 target is a gimme. With this quarter's midpoint guidance we are revising the fiscal year 2017 accretion targets from $0.50 to $0.64 per share.","In the last quarter, we also increased our accretion targets for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Those increased targets were $0.70 for fiscal year 2018 and $0.90 for 2019. All these targets are without stock buyback. We\u2019re again revising the accretion targets upwards for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. We are revising fiscal year 2018 accretion target from $0.70 to $0.90 and we are revising accretion target for fiscal year 2019 from $0.90 to $1. I remained you that the businesses of Microchip and Atmel are now completely intertwined after January 1, 2017 and increasingly difficult to break down.","Last quarter we told you that we will achieve our long-term financial model by the end of fiscal year 2018 versus three to four years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. With the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results from the core Microchip business as well as Atmel, we just about achieved our long-term model on the operating margin of 33% last quarter, it\u2019s fully ahead of our last update.","We also expect to achieve our 59% gross margin model in the next six months as some of the benefits of Micrel fab shutdown are ahead and we have barely begun on moving some of the Atmel\u2019s products to Microchip\u2019s assembly and test technology and we are already ahead of our operating expensive model Therefore today we are revising our long-term financial model up upwards. We're setting up a new long-term financial model that new long-term non-GAAP financial model is 60% gross margin, 24% operating expense and 36% operating profit.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory writer up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analyst continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this, operator, will you please pull for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Steve, even if you exclude the 1% contribution from Atmel like a pulled forward, December quarter was a bit above seasonal. So can you talk about the environment you're seeing out there, how much of it is, just some slight improvement versus Microchip specific?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think we have been kind of telling you all along that we see the environment to be pretty good and many of the concerns that Street has shown on the environment or in China in the past a year or so, we have been continuously arguing that we were not seeing those, our results were very good, they were good by month and for the whole quarter. So, true, if you take that 1% away our result would still have been about to flat to the September quarter and we have never had a flat December quarter. It\u2019s always down two percentage points.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then as my follow-up, any thoughts on the dividend in terms of just potential growth there and I asked that just because free cash flow is starting to inflect higher. Certainly on the other hand you guys have been very effective at M&A and creating value that way. So just how you think about kind of dry part of M&A versus some potential for increase dividend growth.","Steve Sanghi","Well. We're basically using all of our free cash flow created in U.S. for paying the dividend. I mean we're really breaking even on the U.S. cash flow, sometimes you have to borrow little bit from the credit line and all the excess cash generation is all overseas. So there's really no change in the dividend strategy. We'll continue to do what we're doing increase it by just by a smidgen every quarter and majority of the cash will continue to really grow overseas. And none of this has any kind of repatriation dialed in. We don't know what that rule would be and what the new administration will or will not be able to do.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a strong results. Just going back to the updated accretion numbers for Atmel. I just want to make sure that I'm clear. Is that just assuming incremental sort of cost synergies and your ability to do things like have better price discipline at Atmel and doesn't include any potential revenue synergies. And if that's the case, can you kind of give us the 300-day update on kind of what sort of revenue synergies we should expect over time between sort of core Atmel and core Microchip.","Steve Sanghi","So it basically includes all of that, includes a cost reduction, it includes the gross margin improvement, it includes a reduction in the product cost using some of Microchip's technologies and others. And it includes revenue energy. Basically if we didn't have Atmel, what the result would have been and what are the results total, the difference is the accretion. So it's all included.","John Pitzer","I guess that\u2019s all. And then little bit more detail maybe from Ganesh on kind of the internal manufacturing capability that you're building up this year on the CapEx. I guess help me understand at the end of sort of this CapEx then what percent of your test and packaging will you be doing in-house versus sort of external and I guess what's the financial implication as you bring more in-house.","Ganesh Moorthy","We have a multi-quarter plan that looks at different package combinations being brought in for assembly and test. If you go back and look at the last several acquisitions that we've done, they all had a little to know internal capability. And so the percentage of assembly we were doing in-house has come down and the percentage of test we've done in-house has come down. Now we will only bring things back in-house when we find that the cost improvement is significant and the payback in any CapEx we have is within our guideline.","And we have plenty of opportunity within that \u2013 within those guidelines. And so we are systematically going ahead with CapEx increases. Specifically to build up our assembly capacity in-house as well as the test capability in-house. We have some more advanced test technology that we have deployed on many of our Microchip products that we can bring to bear on the Atmel and micro product lines as well. And so it will be a sustained investment over many many quarters as we bring more in-house capability for assembly and test and bring the cost down in every one of those cases within the return on investment guidelines we have for any CapEx investment.","John Pitzer","And Ganesh, those efforts already fully reflected in your long-term operating margin targets.","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes. There's a big chunk of it which will be \u2013 there will be additional improvement that we will make over time. But by and large it's hard to separate out a single element of just assembly or test, overall improvement so we're trying to make that are reflected in the long-term goals.","John Pitzer","Perfect, thanks, guys. congratulations.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Congratulations on the good results and thanks very much for taking the question. The questions on the manufacturing side and just where your lead times are with the strength that you're seeing in the cycle on some of the changes you're making to your operational footprint are any of your lead times for products starting to extend.","Steve Sanghi","Our lead times at all generally normal, there is always pockets here and there, but there's no significant lead time changes.","Mark Delaney","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of at the timeline to get to the new target model of 50% gross margin. When you get Atmel fully integrated to that, get you to that 60% gross margin or the other things that need to occur if you to close the remainder of that gap.","Ganesh Moorthy","We usually do not provide the revenue level or the timeline at which we achieve that model. It's a long-term model usually it's a little bit out. And you saw in the last couple of times we achieved that rapidly while initial guidance was three or four years away, but we don't clearly provide a granularity on that.","Steve Sanghi","Right, we don't, maybe to what I'll add to that is, we said on this call that in six months will be at 59% or above gross margin. So that leaves us 1 percentage point away from the gross margin side and the midpoint of our guidance, for operating expenses this quarter is 24.5%. So we're going to make pretty rapid improvement to get there, but we don't want to tie it to a specific date or revenue target.","Mark Delaney","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll continue onto Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and congratulations on this solid quarterly performance and outlook. On the analog side, you guys are within striking distance of billion dollars in annualized sales. I think Steve you've shown previously, your MCUs and attach rate to Supertex's products for example post that acquisition. I'm wondering if you have any attach rate metrics you can share with us is relates to Microchips analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs.","Steve Sanghi","We probably have some data on it. It\u2019s early not enough time has lapsed. But nothing that I can give it to you verbally on this call, we\u2019ll see if you can include slide and so in some future conference presentation.","Harlan Sur","Okay, great. And then given the business system switch over that happened earlier in January, it looks like that got executed or is getting executed pretty well here. Are there any OpEx synergies realized post that move and I believe also that there\u2019s a potential for some site consolidation here in Silicon Valley as well, has a decision been made to implement that and if so kind of timing and impact to the cost structure.","Steve Sanghi","So, there are cost synergies posts to go live. So essentially \u2013 starting this quarter essentially, most of the Atmel and CPU System goes into the read-only mode only, if not being used. So lot of the costs related to come out \u2013 related to that come out \u2013 some of them do not come out for the entire quarter, because till we close the quarter announced earning filed a Q and all that we have to keep accessing it. Some of the costs go out for about half of the quarter. Some of the costs go out for about all the quarter. And then the next quarter, they will be even for a longer time. So that\u2019s the first part of your question.","The second part of your question is regarding the site consolidation. So we are getting out of the Atmel building, it\u2019s extremely expensive 8 story building right near the airport. Great views and all that, but just extremely unaffordable and expensive compared to any of the microchip properties anywhere in the world. And we\u2019re consolidating all of the remaining Atmel employees into two other campuses we have in San Jose. One is the Micrel campus and other one is a campus where all of our other acquisitions are, SST, SMSC, OG and roving networks and all the other acquisitions, which is on Holger 3 [ph] in San Jose if you\u2019re familiar with it. About half of Atmel employees have already moved to our campuses and the remaining have will move pretty much by the end of February or early March. That building total had I think a $10 million cost per year. And what portion of it is already behind.","Eric Bjornholt","About half of it. because half of the floor is already\u2026","Steve Sanghi","So half of it is already behind and in our Q3 numbers. The other half will be no longer in our numbers probably three quarter for this quarter and 100% for the following quarter.","Harlan Sur","Right. And just to \u2013 I could just squeeze one more in for Eric. At your long-term financial targets of 33%, I can see your runway for free cash flow margins to approach kind of 20% to 30%. Is that kind f the way I would think about it?","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, so that\u2019s not a metric that that we have provided to the street, but you\u2019re definitely the ballpark there. I mean if you look at the free cash generation last quarter just taking the operating income less the CapEx that those levels.","Harlan Sur","Great thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financial.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution guys. Steve, I wanted to start off just by getting your feedback on what appears to be when I listen to the prepared comments and some of the Q&A an unusually large number of company specific growth drivers for this year. It seems like the list would include better Atmel customer reception for products based on improvements you\u2019ve made to that business.","The competitors distribution actions, which have facilitated company specific share gain for microchip. The pricing action that was taken on Atmel\u2019s portfolio last year, which would have meaningful year-on-year benefits, and then your ability to attach your analog products to Atmel\u2019s microcontrollers and drive growth from that initiative. So, is that there and as you look at the business \u2013 are there anything \u2013 is there anything that you see that would be a material driver to company specific growth beyond that list.","Steve Sanghi","And I think you got most of them. I think we are gaining share in our microcontroller, analog, Wi-Fi, licensing business and other businesses are improving their gross margin, cutting the OpEx, gaining the synergies having a good attach success with all sorts of analog, Wi-Fi products and on the microcontroller and vice versa. I think you\u2019ve got most of them.","Craig Ellis","Okay. And then looking at looking at the Company\u2019s intermediate term evolution, you\u2019ve made no secret in the past that you want to continue to execute an organic and inorganic growth strategy. But, as you look at the financial readiness you\u2019re certainly getting to that coverage earlier than expected three months ago operational readiness working through the systems integration. Where are we in your mind with respect to being ready to look for incremental opportunities for inorganic growth?","Steve Sanghi","So we have been extremely inward focused lately to make sure all this integration goes flawlessly and while we\u2019re doing all that and basically running two companies. The Microchip core performance is not slip and you have seen that that we have performed miraculously in both end. So there is currently not a company in our funnel, I mean, we have to after we complete the Atmel integration and we have to restart the work of really reenergizing the funnel and look at what is available and start to date and try to find something. So right now we can\u2019t give you any update on next M&A.","Craig Ellis","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Thank guys, great job. Hey, just a question on market share out there. Now that Freescale is being taken over by MXP and Renaissance is undergoing a big restructuring in Japan. How is that been for you guys market share wise, do you seeing any opportunities there? Is there any impact on the microcontroller marketplace from those transactions?","Ganesh Moorthy","There is nothing I can point to in the near-term that results in market share changes from what just described. Obviously as the combination for NXP and Qualcomm complete they will be restructuring actions that will be announced, some of that will create opportunity for us, we\u2019ve seen that in prior combinations as other have gone through. And we expect to gain our unfair share on that.","Renaissance is a more of a mystery and lot of their business is really transacted in Japan, Japan is not always the easiest of market for a non-Japanese manufacture to be able to breakthrough. But we have seen Renaissance opportunities outside of Japan and that is not just something recent that has happened ever since the combination of Hitachi, Mitsubishi and then subsequently NEC all have taken place as people will have different challenges with Renaissance from a long-term perspective some of it natural disaster faced, many of it business faced in terms of how they have gone forward.","Chris Stanley","Got it. And as follow-up, now that things are starting to settle down and you really have your arms wrapped around Atmel, how would you characterize your thoughts on the relative growth rate that your analog versus your microcontroller business going forward?","Steve Sanghi","Well, Chris, we don\u2019t really look at it that way. There are microcontroller business units and there are analog business units and they are funded, they all looking for new products and opportunities, we don\u2019t have a model in mind that we have to drive microcontroller to a given percentage and analog to a given percentage at the expense of the other. So each find its markets and growth and some are connected because of attach and wherever the numbers fall the percentage of analog or percentage of microcontroller is a math, it\u2019s the output, it\u2019s not the input.","Chris Stanley","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys, Steve now that you\u2019ve got fixed Atmel, can you come around for Governor of California fix those state like you fixed Atmel, please.","Steve Sanghi","I should get my head examined.","Chris Stanley","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll continue on to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Gil Alexandre","Good evening, wonderful job. Question on your inventories aren\u2019t they a bit light or where would you like them to be at the end of third quarter.","Steve Sanghi","Our inventories definitely on the lighter side they are lower than they have been in recent past. But every quarter we have been kind of beating the numbers and honestly not been able to build the inventories we set a target where the inventory would slightly grow and then we ship it all and the inventory does not grow. Last quarter especially we shipped all those product requested by the customers because of the go live shipping out. So that product got shipped otherwise that would have been in the inventory.","So if the inventory builds a little bit in the coming quarters we will not be disappointed but we haven\u2019t been able to build them.","Gil Alexandre","Could you give us an insight on what your R&D expenditures will be for this year?","Steve Sanghi","So no significant change, I think if you look at our current model for this quarter of 24.5% non-GAAP R&D is about\u2026","Ganesh Moorthy","13.5% to 14%.","Steve Sanghi","Its in the 13% range or so, so whatever model for the revenue you want to use for the year, but 13% and that would be pretty good approximation.","Gil Alexandre","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. just question as you move towards the long-term operating model are there any discrete items in there \u2013 discrete things that you need to accomplish there or is this more of just kind of the normal revenue growth and blocking and tackling going forward.","Steve Sanghi","Lot\u2019s of moving parts, mostly blocking and tackling but the completion of the Atmel integration, which means all the duplicate expenses after go live going away, which will be really completely gone away next quarter then you got all the cost savings from Micrel fab into the P&L. Remember we ship in first-in, first-out and we close the fab in the November timeframe. So you\u2019ll see some this quarter, some next quarter, some may even filter into the following quarter. Then as the business is rising the utilization in all of our factories is increasing. In the last couple of months we have increased wafers in essentially all three of our fabs, the wafer starts.","So as the number of wafer starts continue to increase with the revenue growing this year there is a higher utilization treating to gross margin, then Ganesh talked about applying our assembly test technology to some of Atmel\u2019s products and bringing them in that would be beneficial doing the same thing from Micrel that thing is continuing. The utilization is also improving backend factories we have three of them now, two in Thailand and one in Philippines, the Philippines one came from Atmel.","So its really all those things the pricing increase on Atmel that we have instituted some is done, some is underway, some yet to be done, some customers had stage pricing increase and the last piece doesn\u2019t go effective for a while. The new customers where winning from Atmel products have better Microchip kind of pricing, very old pricing and that\u2019s kind of a gift that keeps giving. So it\u2019s just lots of different things.","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, I\u2019d maybe add one more thing to that. We\u2019ve got an internal team looking at cost within the wafer fab with the joint factories working together to find the best cost to be able to bring to the table and that\u2019s creating significant opportunity today and into the future of cost that are coming out.","Steve Sanghi","Yes.","Chris Caso","All right. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. As the follow-up you talked about \u2013 I think you said you expected to be under 2.1 net debt EBITDA by the end of March 2017. What should we expect after that in terms of priority for use of cash going forward? Are you interested in doing something else? Are you looking to return that? What's your view going forward for use of cash?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think it was the same question asked earlier. Basically we are not changing any of the Board\u2019s decision, but Board has discussed, we're going to maintain our dividend policy that we have today just increasing it by a very nominal amount every quarter like we have been doing and really reserve the majority of our cash for M&A\u2019s which have been so successful. We have added so much accretion and so much of the revenue in profit and market share and all that has come from good number of acquisitions, we have done over the years.","Chris Caso","Great. Okay, thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. We will hear from Lena Zhang with Summit Redstone Partners.","Lena Zhang","Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. And congratulations on solid results and the guidance. So Steve you did mentioned that back and specifically utilization rates improving. Would you mind to give us some numbers on that on utilization rate?","Steve Sanghi","No really, I can\u2019t. We don't share the utilization that way. I don't really have been fingertips or other share it qualitatively, we are improving utilization in all of our three Fab\u2019s and change to all of a three backend manufacturing implements but really not in percentage terms. The percentage is also always misunderstood you try to make a mathematical calculation of utilization going from one number to second number and try to derive that gross margin. It doesn't tend to see really kind of correlate that well that way. This is different complexity of processes and you could be doing a higher value added step outside and being a lower value added up inside and utilization looks higher. But the change may not be as much. So we haven't seen the street decode utilization to gross margin as well, and I think it adds to confusion. So we tend not share it.","Lena Zhang","I see, thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes. Rajvindra Gill. Thanks and congrats on phenomenal results. Steve, I wonder if you could perhaps characterize the demand environment that you're seeing across the different segments as well maybe any color on the geography. Any view on kind of overall demand that will be helpful.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I mean all this is not strictly speaking about Microchip really nothing to say about the overall semi-industry. We're finding that demand environment to be normal. Really I mean if you look at the industry numbers for 2015 and 2016, I believe 2015 industry was low single-digit negative and so the numbers I've seen for 2016 was plus 1% give or take some. And the numbers for 2017, I'm hearing numbers to be positive. So after two years of really flatter down industry, I'm hitting industry numbers to be positive but not giving any personal view on it. When I look at the Microchip opportunities and we see our markets in U.S., Europe, Asia and Japan, I'm seeing market to be normal.","Rajvindra Gill","And a question on the IoT market specifically on the industrial IoT, this seems to be a lot of momentum going on in that particular sub-segment. Wondering if you could provide any thoughts on that market and how you're your position with your portfolio of connectivity microcontroller or your distribution channel?","Steve Sanghi","So I think we've always believe that the industrial market is where the true strength of a IoT fits. It's where there are very strong business models for the investments that are required in the IoT infrastructure that's going to be put in. We have many, many designs that I would fit within that category. And we're optimistic how that growth will be a part of our overall growth going forward.","Rajvindra Gill","Thank you. Congrats again.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. I congratulations also. My question was through around the semi-conductor industry and whether you've seen any change in behavior from your customers and with the consolidation in the industry. Are they giving you better visibility for orders, as Ganesh had said earlier that lead times have been stable and just seems like we're a long cycle and do you think this as the semi-conductor industry changed and less cyclical?","Steve Sanghi","I think from the consolidation \u2013 I don't think lead time behavior is any different. And the behavior that\u2019s different is on pricing. There are customers who have recognized that the industry has consolidated, it has changed and how they were able to essentially, molest the supplies before to constantly get lower prices. It's less possible today if supplies are standing up to them. Many customers have realized that in many customers painfully realizing it and not quite accepting it and fighting it, but losing.","Kevin Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And with no additional questions in the queue, I\u2019ll turn the floor back over to Mr. Steve Sanghi for additional or closing remark.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you for everybody for attending the conference call. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter. And we'll see some of you on the road as we attend various conferences this quarter. So thank you, bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all, again for your participation."],"14404":["Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) Q2 2014 Earnings Call October 30, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","James Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Vice President of Finance","Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President","Steve Sanghi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Analysts","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John W.

I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales in the September quarter were a record $492.7 million, and were up 6.5% sequentially from net sales of $462.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $321 million for microcontrollers, $108.5 million for analog, $35 million for memory, $24.8 million for licensing and $3.4 million of other. Revenue by geography was $95.2 million in the Americas, $98.9 million in Europe and $298.6 million in Asia.","I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance of 58.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.2% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.8% of sales. And net income was a record $136.4 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.63 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58.6% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $171.4 million or 34.8% of sales and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $23.7 million and also include share-based compensation of $13.1 million. The GAAP net income of $99.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share was a result in the quarter.","In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.6% and the GAAP tax rate was 10.3%. The GAAP tax rate in the September quarter was favorably impacted by $2 million of nonrecurring items. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any onetime events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to an 11.5%.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.11, share-based compensation was about $0.062, nonrecurring tax events were about $0.009 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. Share-based compensation was higher in the September quarter and will also be at a higher level than normal on the December quarter due to the vesting of performance-based awards to employees that had been on a voluntary pay reduction program from late Q3 fiscal 2013 through Q1 fiscal 2014.","This performance award vests on November 15, 2013 due to Microchip's achievements of record non-GAAP earnings per share on the September quarter. We believe this pay sacrifice allowed us to remain committed to our strategic programs by avoiding a layoff and helped us deliver the outstanding results you are seeing now. Share-based compensation is expected to impact earnings by about $0.058 in the December quarter and then reduced to about $0.051 in the March quarter.","The dividend declared today of $0.3545 per share will be paid on December 5, 2013 to shareholders of record on November 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $70.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 45th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 39th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid is almost $2.1 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 30, 2013, was $275.1 million or 123 days. We expect days of inventory at the end of the December quarter to be flat to up about 8 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day during the September quarter to 33 days and remain at low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At September 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance decreased slightly on a sequential basis to $230.5 million. Receivables remain in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.","We had strong free cash flow generation in the September quarter of $126.4 million prior to our dividend payment. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.98 billion. And we had $640 million in borrowings under revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the December quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $27.4 million for the September quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2014 to be about $115 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that were outsourced by SMSC.","Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $23 million. One question we have received from investors is whether we are concerned about the level of the short interest in our stock. In summary, we are not. And we wanted to pass along our assessment of the situation. As you know, Microchip has had a convertible bond outstanding since December 2007. The bonds are convertible into 43.4 million shares, which is about 22% of our outstanding common shares. According to public sources, the aggregate short interest position in our shares jumped from approximately 5 million shares to approximately 25 million shares when we issued the convertible. And that number is roughly 20 million shares today. This level was neither surprising nor troubling to us because the significant portion of the convertible bond market consistent of arbitrage funds.","The general strategy of these funds is the whole convertible debt would create an economic-long stock exposure, and then hedge this exposure with a short position in the common shares. It is worth noting that this hedging objective is very different from the strategy of activist or directional short-sellers. In any event, the size of the short position arising from a convertible will correspond to the level of equity exposure in the bonds and the percentage of the bonds being held by arbitrage funds.","We know that a sizable amount of our convertible is held by arbitrage funds. And we believe that their activity represents the majority of the overall short interest, which has generally remained in the 15 million to 25 million shares range since 2007. Other companies that have similar convertible bonds outstanding also have high levels of short interest in their stocks. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was one for the ages with strong growth in each of our product lines and new records in most of them. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product line starting with microcontrollers.","Our overall microcontroller revenue grew a strong 6.9% sequentially in the September quarter to achieve an all-time record of $321 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 22.9% versus the year-ago quarter. As we projected in our July conference call, our 8-bit microcontrollers did set a new record in the September quarter, as did our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. Sometime in the month of November, we expect to ship our 13th billion cumulative microcontroller, a milestone that will occur just 7 months after we ship our 12th billion microcontroller back in April of this year.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 10.9% sequentially in the September quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 48.1% over the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we're offering, the number of customers that we are serving and new applications that we're winning as we continue to gain market share in this segment.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 24% sequentially in the September quarter, registering another strong quarter of growth to also set a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 53.4% over the year-ago quarter. We are continuing to expand our new product portfolio. And next month, we plan to announce a number of blockbuster solutions that will further enrich our 32-bit microcontroller platform offering. In the meanwhile, we are continuing to win new designs. And we're expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Our overall microcontroller results, as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market. The sequential and year-over-year growth rate's well above the market and what we have seen reported by our competitors in their results. We're gaining significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now moving to our analog business. This business grew 5.1% sequentially in the September quarter, the 8th consecutive quarter of sequential growth to also achieve a new record. And it continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 25.2% from the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue now represents 22% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. And at close to $434 million annual sales run rate, it remains one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Moving to our memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products was up 2.9%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 7.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.","Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2014. I will also provide guidance for our long-term model, which we are revising upwards.","We are very pleased with our execution in the September quarter. Our actual net sale exceeded the high end of our guidance. The 59% gross margin we achieved was 100 basis points better than June quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance, as we increased factory output to meet the increased sales results. Our operating profit percentage reached 31.8%. And we are making excellent progress towards what our long-term goal of 32% operating profit was, which we will derive higher later in this call. Non-GAAP earnings per share also exceeded the high end of our guidance and beat our guidance by $0.03 per share. We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales, microcontroller net sales, analog net sales and our licensing business all achieved new records. Individually, 8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers all achieved new all-time records.","Our record 8-bit microcontroller revenue further validates what we have been communicating to investors and analysts, which is that our 8-bit MCU business is very healthy, growing and very profitable. Our 8-bit MCU business is continuing to gain share from competitors could have either moved away from 8-bit or are otherwise uncompetitive and cannot make money in the 8-bit market. We're also continuing to gain market share in the 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU and analog.","We mentioned on our last conference call that Microchip has an outsized exposure to housing, industrial and automotive sectors. These has been some of the strong sectors of the economy this year. While we do not break out our business by these sectors, just looking at some sample customers, we saw significant strength in customers that sell products for housing, industrial and automotive. Last but not the least, the September quarter was our 92nd consecutive profitable quarter, which is 23 years of making profit every quarter.","I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding quarter in every respect. I also wanted to compare our results of September quarter versus the year-ago September quarter. September quarter of this year was up 20.8% over the September quarter last year. Last year, September quarter had 2 months of SMSC net. If we add the third month of SMSC and then compare the September quarter of this year was up 11.5% over September quarter last year. This was the best performance among our peers and competitors, and many of whom were flat-to-down in September quarter over the year-ago September.","Our outstanding results were also recognized by Selling Power magazine who recently named Microchip to its annual 50 Best Companies to Sell For, for 2013. Microchip ranked 19th, and is the only semiconductor company on that list.","Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2014. The December quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter of the year. The December quarter in 2010 and 2011 averaged a sequential decline of 3.5%. Last year was impacted positively by an additional month of revenue from the SMSC acquisition. We're expecting the December quarter this year to be seasonally normal and are guiding for net sales to be flat to down 6% sequentially.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.8% and 59.2% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.3% and 32.2% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.57 and $0.63 per share. As I said earlier in the call, we are revising our long-term model upwards. You may recall that after the acquisition of SMSC, we revised our long-term model downwards. This was driven by the lower gross margin, higher operating expenses and lower operating profit of the SMSC business. We are revising the business model upwards due to 3 reasons. Number one, our microcontroller and analog business has outperformed very well. With improving factor utilization, our margins on microcontrollers and analog have recovered very nicely. We believe that we have further upside as the factory utilization continues to approach the old record and eventually exceed it.","Number two, while we have countered on significant improvement in the SMSC operating model, we have substantially exceeded our own internal goals. SMSC operating model is now approaching the traditional Microchip model. The longer-term synergy actions are also now starting to bear fruit. As one example, I just returned from our Asia-wide distribution conference. The opportunities that our sales and distribution network have identified on SMSC products is truly impressive. As these opportunities move down the sales process and get to the order stage, we will see a substantial growth and a profitability model will continue to improve.","And number three, our licensing business just achieved an all-time record and is at nearly $100 million run rate. At 100% gross margin, its net effect on gross and operating margin is very accretive.","Based on these 3 factors, we are revising our long-term model for Microchip upwards. We are revising the midpoint of gross margin to be 150 basis points higher. We're revising the midpoint of operating expenses to be 100 basis points lower. And we are revising the midpoint of the operating profit to be 250 basis points higher. We now expect the long-term gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus 0.5%. We now expect long-term operating expenses of about 26.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. And we now expect operating profit of about 35%, plus or minus 1%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This takes our long-term operating model back to what it was prior to the SMSC acquisition.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters. And we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp. With this, operator, will you please pull for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Chris Caso of Susquehanna.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just taking into the consideration the revised margin targets, what should we expect with respect to the gross margins, operating margins as we go through this cycle? I think that during the last cycle, your gross margins bottomed to 56%. Would you also assume that we -- obviously, we don't know where revenue will trough during the next downturn, but would you expect to see higher troughs for the same reasons that you had mentioned?","Steve Sanghi","Well, it seems like the gist of your question implies the revenue and continues to gross down here and trough somewhere. Our expectation is that December quarter is seasonally very normal. And as you have seen in the past, December quarter is seasonally down, and then the March is seasonally up. We usually grow low single-digits in the March quarter. And our current expectation is that, that will not be really any different.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. The nature of my question wasn't really near-term. Obviously, it's a cyclical business. So just as you go through the length of a cycle, really, that was what I was getting at.","Steve Sanghi","Yes. So I'm not seeing a recession in front of us. The recessions come in various forms. There are unit recessions, the demand recessions, inventory revenue recessions, financial crisis. And everything is different depending on what we do with our fabs, what we do with our assembly and test, what actions we take. So it's very, very difficult to guide on something we don't see today on really what our actions would be in response to that recession.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes. Maybe just what I would add to that is now that a larger portion of our business is relying on foundry, that has less of the ups and downs in the gross margin area that is not impacted by our own factory utilization. But like Steve said, each cycle is different.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Just a quick follow-up. With regard to the plans to build inventory, could you talk a little bit about the reasons behind that? And I guess perhaps that has some connection to where your lead times are now?","Steve Sanghi","So I'll give you a general opinion on inventory. We don't manage the inventory. We don't manage our factories in a way that we constantly take them up or down to try to manage into a very tight range of inventory. You can go back into our history, we have never done that. The companies who do that are either constantly laying off people and cutting production and then hiring untrained people and definitely trying to grow and making mistakes when the times grow stronger. Our desire to the cycle usually is to run our factories in a much more constant fashion and allows the inventory to fluctuate up or down. Now the very long life cycle of Microchip products, microcontroller, analog and memory products historically has always allowed us to manage it in that fashion, in not taking any large inventory write-offs. You could go back in history, there's no record of Microchip coming into you and saying, we rolled off $100 million of inventory, like some other competitors may have done. So we run the factories much more normally. And we allow the inventory to fluctuate. And as Eric mentioned, in more recent past, we now have 40% of our business coming out of foundries because of significant large acquisitions and others which allows you to really control inventory rapidly by turning the stacks on the outside factories. So when you put it all together, until just 1.5 months ago, we were expediting products and trying to improve production and adding capacity because we -- the midpoint of our guidance for September quarter was 4%. We produced 6.5%. If you manage too tightly on the inventory, you cannot produce that kind of upside in a very short timeframe. And now the December quarter is seasonally down, we expect March quarter to be up. In that kind of environment, we don't really take any actions. So the inventory driven by lower revenue will be higher in December. And we'll decrease some in March. And we'll take those actions over the next 2 or 3 quarters, allow the revenue increase to naturally adjust inventory. Now having said all that, there have been a couple of times in our history, one was after the financial crisis of 2009, and may have been a tech buster. Some of these mega events in the industry will cause the situation where you have to take precipitously some strong actions, otherwise the inventory would go way too high. Other than that, it would be a small one quarter perturbation. We run our business more constantly and not go up and down. Sorry for the long answer.","Operator","And we will go next to Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the overall bookings environment? This time last quarter, you talked about very strong bookings environment. And later in the quarter, you guided to the near to midpoint of the range. And then you ended doing much better than that. So I'm just kind of curious, have the bookings pace moderated at all at this point or do you still expect a fairly strong book to bill and then the December guidance is more of just a little bit more tempered by the normal seasonality?","Steve Sanghi","Well, bookings are still good if I look at the overall long-term backlog. And the bookings that are coming in are still good. But bookings, the large amount of bookings are aging into the next quarter. Some are aging into this quarter, but based on at the rate they're aging and the amount of 9 weeks or so left in the quarter, an introduction to the guidance that we provided. But the overall rate of the bookings are still strong because lots of bookings are coming into the next quarter, which is seasonally stronger quarter for us also.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understand, that's helpful. And then, I guess, if you think about the upward vision to your gross margin target, how much do you think is being driven by the licensing business versus the mix of products you're expecting to have versus utilization? Any way to put some kind of rough sense on that?","Steve Sanghi","They were really in bad order. The best performance we're getting is really out of our own microcontroller and analog businesses. There was a concern from the street on our 32-bit business. There was a concern on our 8-bit business. There was concern on our 16-bit business. They will get squeezed by 8 and 32. There was the concern on our 8-bit business because everybody else is going away from it. And there was a concern on our 32-bit business because we're not ARM. The 19 covered many years now, we have demonstrated there are 8, 16, 32-bit. All those 3 businesses are -- they're a tremendous win. And they're all growing. And they're all making records. And they're all high margins and so on and so forth. So temporarily, during last year, our gross margin went down because essentially, factory utilization. And it affected significantly our internal businesses, the ones we run inside our fabs because those were the ones mainly impacted by lower utilization. As that utilization has continued to improve, and especially by beating these numbers, last 3 quarters, we have written our revenue guidance. The utilization is getting quite healthy, but there is more to grow. And as we are seeing the utilization improve, our internal margins are back to the historical margins. Either they are where we can project them going forward as the utilization improves a bit more. The second effect is at SMSC. When we purchased SMSC, its full year operating margin in the year prior to our acquisition was only 12%. And until the time we were breaking it out, I think we had told you a quarter or so ago that we had more than doubled that operating profit. We're no longer breaking it out because the numbers are very intertwined. Operating expenses are very hard to figure out, what division they're going into. But based on our own assessments internally, that business now is performing as well as our own business withdrawal. This is how much we have improved then. And some of the long-term accretion is underway and yet to come. Every quarter, as it goes by, a higher and higher portion of their product is running into our factories for assembly and test purposes. And the ultimate accretion really comes from the market players where we are seeing an enormous sales opportunities sometimes developed in selling SMSC products around Microchip's consumer and industrial automotive customer sockets, which our sales and distribution network has identified an enormous opportunity. And some of them, we'll see them in later part of the next year, and some are longer term. But all those, they are very high margin into a Microchip business system. A lot of them will be coming from Microchip's ecosystem in terms of factories and all that, and will be very, very high margins. So that's another thing that's accreting. And the third order of effect is the licensing business.","Operator","And we will go next to John Pitzer of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, clearly, one of the core competencies that you guys have proven over the last several years are finding and integrating these acquisitions. I'm kind of curious, relative to the answer to your last question, any way to quantify either through incremental TAM or the kind of incremental growth rates? Do you think these acquisitions have added to the core Microchip business? And I guess more importantly, are you now at a TAM level or expected growth rate level longer-term that you're satisfied with whether you see other opportunities to holding on acquisitions and integration?","Steve Sanghi","Well, it's difficult to put numbers on it, nor are we usually comfortable in putting numbers on it. Because, one, it projects too much. And secondly, it tells everybody else what we're doing, our competitors and others. So in general, I'm always uncomfortable in giving that kind of data. But let me give you one. If you look at our December quarter guidance, despite the December quarter being guided down 3%, our December quarter at that guidance, midpoint of the guidance, will be up 15% from December quarter of last year, 14.9% to be exact. And there's no acquisition in between. The December quarter last year had full SMSC in it. So December quarter last year to December quarter this year at the midpoint of the guidance will be up 14.9%. Who is up 14.9% right now? Most companies are down year-over-year and driving down further in December quarter. So you are seeing the result of internal core strengths in 8, 16, 32 and analog. You've seen this type of acquisitions. You're seeing our ability to take these acquisitions and digest them. And then be able to create more business out of them across our customers and sockets and all that. I don't know whether that answers your question.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful, Steve. And maybe as a quick follow-on. Historically, you guys have given us sort of revenue detail by product, less so by end market given how much goes to distribution. I'm just kind of curious, as you think about exploiting things like the auto end market vertical, do you -- does the curved distribution model work as well or will you start having operationally more of an end market focus to try to exploit some of these revenue opportunities?","Steve Sanghi","We have always had selected end market focus. We told you that when we acquired SMSC. One of the criticism was that Microchip is a horizontal-focus company and SMSC is a vertical-focus company. And they don't fit. It was a bad acquisition, if you recall. Microchip has always run the automotive business in a vertical market fashion for years, 12 years, 15 years plus. Our automotive business does not go through distribution. We do business with all large automotive companies and their suppliers. And that has always been handled by Microchip's dotted sales force. So SMSC's automotive business fit very, very well along with that. And we have found substantial incremental opportunity on SMSC's automotive sockets around really our business and vice versa. Same as the case, we did business directly with a number of large computing manufacturers which will not go through distribution. And same way, SMSC's business fit very well with that. And we have found sockets around each of those -- sockets and business units. So Microchip has always been a mixture of a broad-based long-tail horizontal company, yet executing only large number of vertical focuses very, very well. We have had a vertical focus on automotive, home appliances, medical, energy, which material is it?","James Eric Bjornholt","Touch.","Steve Sanghi","Touch.","James Eric Bjornholt","From an interface test.","Steve Sanghi","I would say a bunch of display driving and all that.","James Eric Bjornholt","That was automotive infotainment. I mean, it's a pretty broad range.","Steve Sanghi","Automotive infotainment, model control, connectivities. So there are a number of large vertical application kind of areas that we had really managed very well internally, and really have a dual sale structure with centers of expertise in various markets that work together with a horizontal sales force.","James Eric Bjornholt","So maybe if you're assuming that because the distribution sales are quite large, that those are not customers we target. There's a good portion of distribution revenue that actually has resulted from Microchip creating the demand. But will our customers choose what the best fulfillment channel for them is, and in many cases that's direct, and in some cases, that's distribution. But distribution customers are not left just to distribution to create a demand","Operator","And we will take our next question from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","This is [indiscernible]. I'm dialing in for Craig. So microcontrollers have been really strong for the last few quarters. So could you talk more about your 32-bit microcontrollers? Like what applications are they seeing the stronger design traction? And also, could you just compare your 32-bit product introductions this year related to last year?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, you want the last part of the question? And how do we compare our new product introductions this year to last year?","Ganesh Moorthy","Okay. So let me start with the second part of the question. We're -- obviously, we're accelerating data new product introduction. And as I mentioned, you're going to see some blockbuster announcements coming in the month of November. It's an area where we have been continuing to increase investment over the last several years. We're building out portfolio to fill out range of different memory sizes, functionalities, packet sizes, et cetera, et cetera, to build a strong portfolio that can be used in many, many different applications. And you'll see that as we move into 2014. That breadth of products will continue to accelerate. In terms of the applications themselves, they are often in the kinds of applications where our 16-bit microcontrollers are. They are run-of-the-mill applications. They can be in power supplies, in the human interface and motor control and in general. Then you'll find them in coffee machines and cars and broad range of applications, but where that is more needed in terms of either performance, memory, features or otherwise than what our 16-bit portfolio can provide. And so we provide a seamless migration in the way that we have planned our products that customers can go up and down, our microcontroller range of products, in the case of 32-bit most often from our 16-bit products up. And there's nothing earth-shattering about a brand new application that our 32-bit is in that is driving all the design. So it's pretty a broad range of designs, a broad range of applications that we're designed into.","Unknown Analyst","Got it, that's helpful. From a follow-up, like as I said, like SMSC integration is broadly complete. And it's on the same target model now. What is your appetite for additional acquisitions? And what's the biggest holdup currently? Is this pricing, the lack of target? Like what is your plan going forward?","Steve Sanghi","Our appetite is very good, but we don't have a target.","Ganesh Moorthy","And we're disciplined about how we approach it.","Steve Sanghi","We're disciplined about how we approach it. We have passed on a number of targets that we have looked at for various reasons, the lack of faith, not priced appropriately. Our synergies stick with our business for various other reasons. But if investors and analysts were to give us ideas, we'll be happy to take them. Don't expect feedback on them whether where we are in the process after to give us that idea, but we do not have a target today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] All right, and we will go to our next question. That is Terence Whalen from Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question wanted to focus on licensing, in particular. It sounds like based on the increase in the target profitability model, you're continuing to expect licensing to be a strong portion of that profitability. I just wanted to understand going forward, how we should think about modeling that line, whether that line can continue to grow or whether there are any certain sort of expirations that we have to be aware of in terms of any terms of future cliff in licensing revenue?","Steve Sanghi","The licensing revenue is very broad. We essentially have most foundries in the world of license, lots of larger IDM customers to license. There are many market segments, microcontrollers, SoCs, FPGAs, smartcards and others that run on using our process technologies. So it's a fairly broad-based business. And really, there is no very major lumpiness in it like you shouldn't expect in one quarter, you come in, it goes down 50%, and if you like that because of some expiry. There are lots of different process that we're getting royalties all the way on 0.5, 0.35, 0.25, 0.18, 0.13, 0.11, and 90-nanometer and 55. And so it's really very broad. And it's just a few things will go down in volume while the new ones are going up. So I think -- I don't know whether that answers your question, but you shouldn't be concerned about any major reduction of any kind.","James Eric Bjornholt","And there are ongoing new licensees that are coming on board.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So steady and stable, it sounds like. The quick follow-up I had was a longer-term technology question. As you sort of evaluate the development of the Internet of Things, I know that's a very broad and loose term. But do you feel like you have the right capabilities? And where do you see the opportunities? Do you have the correct RF Technology, in particular that pair with your controllers?","Ganesh Moorthy","It's a market we've been in for a while. And there are several ingredient capabilities that are needed to enable customers who want to reach an Internet of Things solutions. So if you look at -- and fundamentally, you need some form of microcontroller in these applications. Often these are applications we're already designed in. And a customer is now looking to extend the capability to connect to the Internet. So let's look at a thermostat as an example. If you take a standard thermostat, we've been in it for 20-plus years with analog functionality, microcontroller functionality. Now customers that have the thermostat who wants to be able to connect to the Internet takes advantage of our wireless capability. In most cases, it will be a Wi-Fi connection that we can enable, and we have enabled using our Wi-Fi modules that we provide. In other cases, it might be a proprietary wireless that then has a way to get back into the Internet. The other big challenge that many customers have is, well, how do they manage the other side of this which is the cloud itself? Some customers are sophisticated and have the ability to manage how they have a setup on the cloud that can receive the data and then be able to do something with it. But we have many customers for whom that is new. And as you saw earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Amazon. Actually, it was last week that we announced to be able be help host these capabilities, and enable people to take advantage of existing solutions, but get on the cloud with their applications. So we believe we have put together with our existing solutions and with partnerships for the cloud, the ingredients that are needed for anybody who has an Internet of Things thought process or application that they want to get into.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Shaon Baqui calling in for Chris. I just want to get your thoughts real quick on the various GEOs [ph], if you're seeing any particular areas of strength here as we look in the December quarter?","Steve Sanghi","Eric?","James Eric Bjornholt","So I mean, typically, what we will see in the December quarter is that due to the holidays, we'll see Europe and the Americas have some stress on the business. And Asia typically does okay, but it's not enough to offset the weakness that we see out of Europe and the Americas. So it's really a holiday-driven phenomena, just like we see in the March quarter with Asia being week due to the Chinese New Year.","Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And this is a quick follow-up as we look into the December quarter. Can you give us kind of the puts and takes in your guidance? Are there any segments here that meant to your analog particularly that may be up or down a little bit more than the others?","Ganesh Moorthy","We don't really break out by segment.","Steve Sanghi","We have 14 product divisions inside Microchip internally, how we manage it. And it's just too many. We bucket them for you in a way to 16 and 32 analog and all that, but it's much broader internally. And some of them have multiple things in one division. So I can't break it down any further.","Operator","And we will go next to go Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","Two questions, if I may ask. Could you give us an idea of your factory utilization at this time?","Steve Sanghi","So historically, we have not given a number on factory utilization. The problem is that there's a tendency then to draw a straight line and try to figure out every point of utilization means we're done on gross margin and kind of track and expect that as utilization goes up or down. In what we have seen has historically reached to long conclusions because in one quarter, unfair portion of our growth may come from foundry products. And other time, they come from internally. And not all products have same gross margins, and depending on what you're running in a given quarter. So it's a very complex mix. And we are, in general, not comfortable with trying to tie a given utilization to a given gross margin. Our utilization has not peaked yet compared to where it was before. There is a significant more accretion to go. And we -- many months -- several more quarters as we continue to increase the utilization for the gross margin to continue to really go higher. And then eventually, utilization will go beyond that. But we're not running all the equipment that we have in our factories flat out. This means the utilization still has a way to go.","Gilbert Alexandre","All right. My second question, on your return from Asia, can you give us any reasonable reading of the Chinese economic growth?","Steve Sanghi","So our China business did enormously well. In fact, that's when we break it out, right, in the queue?","James Eric Bjornholt","Well, we break out the percentage of the total revenue. And it's approaching 29% of the total now.","Steve Sanghi","If you break it out in percentage, they can figure out the dollars.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes.","Steve Sanghi","So where does it grow quarter-over-quarter sequentially?","James Eric Bjornholt","I do not have that in front of me.","Steve Sanghi","But it was a very, very strong growth. So 6.5% overall growth. The highest growth, I think, was still also double-digit. I recall seeing it. So China did very, very well. The China GDP numbers in the latest report were slightly revised upwards. So despite what you hear in China, China business is very solid.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could describe how the 32-bit market may differ from 8 and 16 in terms of perhaps what customers are looking for or the product needs. And as a follow-up, how you would view your progress in this market so far compared to the previous markets?","Ganesh Moorthy","So, I want you to think of 32-bit as not a separate market. It's one continuum of microcontroller markets for which different products serve the needs of that market. There is a range, performance, memory size and features at which the 32-bit is the right product to be able to use in those applications. Often at the boundary between 16 and 32-bit, you're going to have 16 bits that are in the 32-bit type of applications and vice versa. The -- our own progress here has been outstanding. You can take a look at the last many years over which we have reported our sequential, as well as our year-over-year growth. And it's been significant. Obviously, several years ago, it was growing off of a very small base, but it has continued to grow into a reasonably sized business for us. That product portfolio has expanded in that timeframe. The third available market that we can target has grown with that. And perhaps, the -- in that continuum of 8s, 16s and 32s, the largest change is really the software intensity that is involved in these applications. And so in addition to the silicon level of products, there's a significant software investment that we have to make and being able to enable solutions. And we have done that. And we expect to be doing more of that along with our silicon products in 32-bit in the coming months and years.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Harsh Kumar of Stephens.","Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","This is Richard in for Harsh. I just wanted to get your sense on seasonality. You talked about the seasonality in the December and March quarter, but have you seen any changes in the June and September quarters with the addition of SMSC?","Steve Sanghi","No. If you -- actually, did not seem to have changed our seasonality. June and September quarters were very strong. March quarter was good. June was excellent. September was excellent. December is seasonally normal. And we're expecting March to be seasonally normal, which would be up in the single-digits.","Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And my follow-on relates to SMSC as well. Have you seen any benefits from the back end integration yet? And if not, when do you expect to see those benefits?","Steve Sanghi","Yes. We have seen benefit from the back -- integration of the back end. There were some in the June quarter, much more in September quarter to be even more in December. So it's really continuing, and also requires capital investment to bring some of the deal. And we're doing it at a controlled pace.","Operator","And this does concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the call back to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending this call. We'll be at some conferences. I believe the next one is...","James Eric Bjornholt","Well, the next conference will be at the Credit Suisse Conference in Phoenix. We'll also be at the NASDAQ Conference in London and doing some marketing throughout the quarter.","Steve Sanghi","So we'll certainly see some of you at the CSFB Conference in Scottsdale. I will promise a great weather here in its hometown. So please come and see us. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call. Once again, we would like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"15166":["Microchip Technology, Inc.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's President (sic) [Chairman] and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you. I'd like to turn the call to Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer, first. Eric, go ahead.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, everybody.","During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and make some specific comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were just over $1 billion, above the high end of our guidance and up 0.8% sequentially from net sales of $994.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of our guidance at 61.7%, which is a new record level for Microchip. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.2% of sales, and non-GAAP operating income was a record 39.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $351.3 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.40, which was above the high end of our guidance of $1.37. Non-GAAP EPS in the March 2018 quarter was up 20.7% compared to the March quarter of 2017.","For fiscal year 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $3.981 billion and up 13.7% year over year. Gross margins were 61.1%. Operating expenses were 22.4% of sales, and operating income was 38.7% of sales. Net income was $1.356 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.45 per diluted share.","On a GAAP basis, gross margins in the March 2018 quarter, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 61.4%. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.3 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $371 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $122.8 million, share-based compensation of $20 million, $5.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million.","GAAP net income in the quarter was $146.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share, and was impacted by a couple of discrete events in the quarter. GAAP net income was impacted by a $15.5 million charge associated with marking our investments to market through the P&L. These investments used to be held to maturity, but since the investments will be liquidated to fund the acquisition of Microsemi, the unrealized loss that would have been recorded in other comprehensive income in the absence of the anticipated acquisition was recognized in earnings. GAAP net income was also impacted by $38.9 million of discrete tax expense during the quarter, primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","For fiscal year 2018, net sales were a record $3.98 billion. Gross margins were 60.8%. Operating expenses were 37.3% of sales, and operating income was 23.5% of sales. Net income of $255.4 million was $1.03 per diluted share.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter. As we have continued to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are now expecting about $327 million of taxes to be paid over the eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore, referred to as the transition tax. This estimate is up modestly from what we had discussed with investors last quarter. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $26 million in years one through five, $49 million in year six, $65 million in year seven, and $82 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and these estimates may change as we complete our full analysis.","As we look forward, excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be between 8% and 9%, which is what we are providing to investors for cash flow and non-GAAP operating model forecasting purposes.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at March 31, 2018 was $476.2 million. Microchip had 112 days of inventory at March 31, 2018, down three days from the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 36 days and up two days from the December quarter.","The cash flow from operating activities was $359.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.197 billion, of which over $700 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash can be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost.","Our EBITDA in the March 2018 quarter was a record $429.6 million. Our net leverage excluding our 2037 convertible debentures was 0.95 times at March 31, 2018, positioning us well for the Microsemi acquisition.","Capital expenditures were $58.4 million in the March 2018 quarter and $206.8 million for fiscal year 2018. In April, we completed a purchase of a building in San Jose for $40.8 million, which we had previously leased. This purchase will reduce our ongoing operating expenses. Excluding this building purchase, we expect about $30 million to $50 million in capital spending in the June quarter. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be between $200 million and $250 million, of which $70 million represents the San Jose building purchase and three other buildings being constructed, which we have discussed with you before.","We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.","Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.8 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.","We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slower March quarter, with a sequential revenue growth of 0.8%. March quarter 2018 revenue over March quarter 2017 revenue grew 11%, all organic growth, as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters.","On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 revenue grew a strong 13.7% over fiscal year 2017. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities, as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions.","Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business has performed well for a March quarter, with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the December quarter. March quarter 2018 revenue was up a very strong 13.2% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 Microcontroller revenue at $2.6 billion was an all-time record and grew a strong 17.5% over fiscal year 2017. Microcontrollers represented 65.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2017. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers. We were the fastest-growing 8-bit microcontroller franchise and gained substantial market share in calendar 2017, as we grew much faster than the 8-bit microcontroller market, so much so we are now approximately 60% larger than the number two 8-bit microcontroller player.","In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number five position but continued to gain significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 16-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number six position but also gained significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 32-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise here too.","For microcontrollers overall, we remained in the number three position. We're the fastest-growing franchise and grew at almost 2.5 times the microcontroller market, as we continued our relentless march towards the number one spot.","Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger, and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018, as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.7% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process. March quarter 2018 analog revenue grew 5.1% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 analog revenue at $952 million was an all-time record and grew 6% over fiscal year 2017. Analog represented 24.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","As we have highlighted in investor communications over the last few quarters, our publicly reported analog results will see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions.","The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher-value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely. And as they replace older products in new designs, our revenue classification for these products has shifted from analog product lines to our microcontroller product line.","Transitioning to more sticky and higher-margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in, as some of the revenue growth shifts into our microcontroller product line. In the longer term, as the revenue from the analog attach design wins continue to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will outgrow this revenue classification headwind.","Moving next to our licensing business, this business was seasonally down 4% sequentially in the March quarter, although March quarter 2018 revenue grew 14.6% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 licensing business at $104.8 million was an all-time record and grew 14.9% over fiscal year 2017. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed many foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes, manifested in our results as the licensed processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come.","Finally, our memory business was sequentially up 3.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, and March quarter 2018 grew 9.9% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 memory revenue at $199.7 million grew 7.2% over fiscal year 2017.","Now a quick update about Microsemi and our progress since our March 1 announcement, integration planning meetings and discussions are occurring between the business units, sales, manufacturing, and support groups of both companies. Teams at both companies started to identify product cross-selling opportunities that we can pursue after the close and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of a combined total system approach.","We're also determining how our product line reporting will be done post the close, and we'll have an update for you no later than the next earnings call. Steve will cover the status of regulatory and other approvals in his section.","So now let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Ganesh, and good morning for you, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and fiscal year 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2019.","Our March quarter financial results were excellent. Our net sales were up 0.8% sequentially and up 11% from the year-ago quarter and were above the high end of our revised guidance. The sales in our Atmel-originated business was down, consistent with Atmel seasonality. Our core Microchip business was very strong and up significantly sequentially.","Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7% of sales was a record and at the high end of our guidance. Operating profit of 39.5% of sales was better than the high end of our guidance and made a new all-time record. And earnings per share of $1.40 was $0.055 better than the midpoint of our revised guidance.","Reflecting on the fiscal year 2018 results, it was clearly the best year in the history of Microchip, in which we made many new records. Fiscal year 2018 net sales were up 13.7% from fiscal year 2017, and it was all organic growth. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and fiscal year 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 110th consecutive profitable quarter.","Now, I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit customer applications. Our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line, through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers.","At our Analyst and Investor Day on March 1, 2018, we showed that the number of Microchip parts per customer system was growing at a 20% annual rate. With another quarter under our belt, the number of parts per system is continuing this trend of being up 20% over the same quarter a year ago. We have a robust design win funnel, and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working. We also recently received SIA [Semiconductor Industry Association] numbers for quarter ending March 31, 2018. Based on SIA numbers, our microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit product lines in the March 2018 quarter versus the year-ago quarter.","Our inventories at Microchip at the end of March 2018 were 112 days, which is just slightly below our target of 115 to 120 days. We continue to make enormous progress on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. In the last conference call, we stated our lead times to be between 4 to 14 weeks. Our lead times now are between 4 to 10 weeks. Normal lead times would be between 4 to 8 weeks.","Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was extremely healthy and around the number we had given you at the Analyst Day, and our backlog has grown even higher to another record. With healthy book-to-bill ratio continuing, now will be the time to start providing quarterly numbers for book-to-bill ratio, as we had said in the Analyst Day. We have always said that book-to-bill ratio is confusing and simply tracks the lead times. We have proven it again with book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 in the December quarter. The business remained healthy in March quarter. Providing book-to-bill ratio simply increases volatility in the stock. In the March quarter, we successfully soft-landed the business, consistent with the guidance we have been providing, and we will continue to grow in the June quarter.","During the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we will adopt a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which will result in recognition of revenue at the time products are sold to distributors, whereas currently revenue on such transactions are deferred until the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end-market demand, and this is not how we manage our business.","As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue will be based on true end-market demand, so we will report a non-GAAP revenue which will be based on true end-market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer, meaning we will continue to report a non-GAAP revenue based on sell-through.","We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on such sell-through revenue recognition. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on sell-through revenue recognition. Therefore, along with GAAP results, which will be based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.","In terms of guidance, we will only provide guidance based on non-GAAP revenue, so we expect total non-GAAP net revenue for the June quarter to be up 1% to 6% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at 3.5%. Given the amount of revenue beat in March quarter, this guidance is modestly better than the expectation we had provided during the Analyst Day.","Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 61.6% and 62% of sales. We expect our overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 39.2% and 40% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.39 and $1.49 per share. All these numbers do not include Microsemi.","Now I wanted to make a couple of comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. On April 12, 2018, we received U.S. antitrust clearance. On April 19, 2018, China's MOFCOM accepted Microchip's filing for review under Simplified Procedure. We cannot confirm yesterday's report in the press that China's MOFCOM has cleared the transaction. We believe that the review process is running smoothly, and we remain optimistic that we will receive clearance shortly. In addition, yesterday, on May 7, we did receive Japan's antitrust clearance.","We expect several other countries to clear the antitrust review this month. The Microsemi shareholder vote is scheduled for May 22, 2018, and we believe that we are on schedule for closing the acquisition sometime during early June 2018.","I want to remind investors that during our Analyst and Investor Day presentations, we increased our long-term financial model with the Microsemi acquisition to a non-GAAP gross margin of 63%, operating expense of 22.5%, and an operating profit of 40.5%.","As you all know, we will be borrowing about $8 billion to close the Microsemi transaction. I want to assure you that after the closure of Microsemi acquisition, we plan to use all of our cash generation, after dividend and capital, of course, to rapidly delever the balance sheet until the leverage comes down to about 2.5x, which is our long-term target.","In addition, given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimate to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, thanks so much for taking my question. You highlighted earlier in your prepared remarks that you've added capacity, I think, as it related to the Atmel products to reduce the lead times there. I'm wondering if you can talk about your anticipation for lead times as we go forward. Do you expect that to get in the normal range in the current quarter?","And I'd also like to know as it relates to your raw materials and lead time from foundries, whether you see that as already within the normal range or if it's extended. And if there's anything remarkable about that, I'd love to hear details. Thank you very much.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So thank you, Will. The normal lead times are 4 to 8 weeks usually on 85% \u2013 90% of the products. That's what we call a normal lead time. There will always be some strange products or specialized projects that need extra work or extreme circumstances where the lead time would be longer. So for a majority of the products, 4 to 8 weeks lead time is normal. We are currently at 4 to 10 weeks, so we've got a little more progress to make. And as we have been saying for about a year or longer is that we expect the lead times to essentially become normal by the end of June, and we are really on schedule for that.","The other part of your question was lead times at suppliers and foundries and all that. Scattered issues here and there, but in general, the foundry lead times are normal. We're able to get the capacity we need from our foundries. We're able to get the assembly\/test equipment that we're acquiring. Again, the lead time could be 2 to 4 weeks longer to get some of the test equipment, but it also largely depends on what you're buying and what the mix of equipment is, what you're trying to buy, and what particular setup you need. But lead times are really not excessive either on foundry wafers or on assembly and test equipment.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Helpful, thanks so much and congrats on the good results and outlook.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Steve, any update on industry pricing, be it from some of the consolidation, some of the favorable impact there, also relative to just the tight conditions today and how that might be influencing pricing?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Type of what?","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The pricing environment today, just if you can, talk about just how the consolidation in the industry is influencing that as well as just the tight industry conditions.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Okay, tight industry conditions. So the pricing is very normal. We've been saying for quite a while that the historic industry practice where the prices went down every year, we are really no longer following that trend. We have seen some others follow it. We are winning a lot more often at customers not giving them year-to-year price reduction. Five years ago, we'll succeed some of the times; today we succeed most of the time. So industry pricing for us really looks very normal.","We did some price increases in the last two years. I think that's largely behind us. Now prices are stable but they're not going down. Meanwhile, we are continuing to improve cost on a lot of products by bringing assembly\/test inside with the die shrinks and others. And in those cases, some of those are improving the gross margin as you're seeing it.","Now in terms of tight industry conditions, they're obviously helping pricing. The consolidation is also helping prices, but where the industry conditions are tightest are really not on microcontroller, analog, and Wi-Fi and other products we make. Industry conditions are the tightest on passives. There could be 40 \u2013 50 weeks lead time to really get capacitors and products like that, and I think that's where we are seeing price increases. We don't sell those devices. We don't compete with them, but we buy some of those devices for our development tool and all that. It's not a very high-cost component for us because development tool is a very small business, but we are seeing long lead times and tight supply especially on passives.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow-up for Ganesh on the Microchip 2.0 cross-selling, and any additional milestones you can share with us on the progress you're making?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","All our internal indicators look good. As Steve mentioned, attach is one of those things we are continuing to measure how that is growing quarter over quarter and year over year. It's a long-term process, but we're sowing lots of seeds and taking care of those seeds to make sure that they bloom, and we're very confident that it will continue to grow and provide growth for us as an incremental growth driver.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I realize Microchip's own inventory came down and is a little bit below your target range. I was hoping you could extend that discussion a bit further and talk about where you think inventory is in the channel and any changes you expect distributors to be making with their inventory.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","The inventory was a little lower than our expectation because sales were higher than our expectation. Our guidance at the midpoint was minus 1% sequentially. And based on that, inventory would be slightly higher and in the range of 115 days to 120 days. Instead, we reported sales which were up 0.8%, so 1.8% beat. Its net result was the inventory days were slightly lower.","I think inventory is fine. Two, three days don't really make that kind of difference. We're comfortable with the inventory position. Inventory, there are always products which are showed and the product was a little high. So there's a continuous effort constantly to get the inventory in the perfect mix. And there's no such thing as perfect, but our inventory is in good shape.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And there was a lot of discussion in the last earnings call and at the Analyst Day about what new seasonality for the company is. I was hoping you could help us better contextualize how you think about guidance for this coming quarter of up 1% to 6% sequentially. How does that compare to what that new seasonality may be? And are there any headwinds or tailwinds relative to normal seasonality that you're trying to factor into your guidance for this coming quarter?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I think at the Analyst Day, we said June quarter was 5%, if you recall, sequentially, but we beat the March quarter by 1.8%. So when you put it all together, at the 3.5%, we're slightly better than that guidance. We did better in manufacturing last quarter in shipping some delinquency that originally we thought we were going to ship it in the June quarter, but we were able to do better and were able to ship some more in the March quarter, which resulted beating the March quarter, and then a little bit of the product went from June into March.","We're facing a lot of one-time issues. There is a slight impact because of ZTE. We can't ship to ZTE. There are long lead times on passive that we talked about, so certain customers are telling us that they don't need our product because they cannot get passives to complete their boards and systems.","China. That has been lowered from 17% to 16%. It doesn't sound much, sounds trivial, but a number of customers asked us to delay shipment from April into May because the lower VAT was effective on May 1. So that pushed some shipments from April into May, but that's kind of a wash for the quarter. But you never know whether they didn't do some production in April and whether there will be any net result for the quarter, hopefully not. The overall trade tensions, we're not seeing any impact of that, but if anything else crazy happens, then you have to account for that.","None of those items I talked about really are significant. They're all 0.1% \u2013 0.2% issues sequentially, but you add all four or five of them and it could be in a 0.5% to 1% probably impact driven by many of these factors together. I think what we guided June quarter is really seasonal, especially if March quarter was minus 1% and the June quarter would have been totally seasonal. So we don't have years of experience with Atmel and the numbers for that seasonality, but what we're guiding seems to be close to seasonal.","The other point is this is all going to change again when the Microsemi deal closes in June. And all the rest of the quarters again, we don't have experience on seasonality. And then when we come to the next March and next June, we're going to have to go through same learning process again. And we barely finished the learning process on Atmel, so that is the challenge of growth through acquisitions.","Operator","We will take our next question...","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Did that answer your question?","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the nice execution. Steve, I wanted to start with two clarifications. One, if you could, provide any color for us on whether this round of approvals, especially through MOFCOM, is different than what you've seen in the past.","And secondly, I thought I heard the statement that the company is expected to borrow about $8 billion related to the upcoming Microsemi transaction, but I thought on the initial announcement it was $8.6 billion. So has there been a modest reduction in the expected debt that's undertaken to complete that transaction?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So answering your second part of your question first, the number that we had stated was really going off the December numbers. And from December to June, we are substantially a cash generating entity, so we have generated $0.5 billion-plus of cash in that time, and so has Microsemi. So there's a portion reduction coming from there. I think that's the only change. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","No, that's exactly right, so that essentially just represents the cash flow between the end of December and the expected closing date.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And the debt level that Microsemi has is a bit lower from what it was at that time. They have paid some debt down.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's helpful, and then any color on how this process through MOFCOM would differ from prior?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So last time we had MOFCOM approval was when we bought Microsemi (sic) [SMSC], which was in 2012. At that time, MOFCOM didn't have a lot of resources. The M&A activity wasn't as brisk, and it was largely few deals used to require MOFCOM and was a long process. It seemed relatively unorganized back then. Any of the deals we have done in between, including ISSC, Supertex, Micrel, and Atmel, none of them required MOFCOM. You require MOFCOM if both entities, buyer and the seller, exceed a threshold of revenue in Mainland China. I think the number is $83.6 million, but don't exactly hold me to it. It's in that range, and none of our other acquisitions have required MOFCOM.","So since 2012, this is the first time we applied for MOFCOM, and we have found that MOFCOM is now substantially very well-organized, has a very good procedure. They take the first month to identify a given transaction to be a simple procedure or a normal procedure. Simple procedure usually is cleared within 30 days, and a normal procedure takes a little longer. So that's why when our transaction was rated by MOFCOM to be under simple procedure, that was encouraging news and we shared it with the investors. That happened on May 19 (sic) [April 19] (40:17), so 30 days really end on May 18. There's no guarantee that even under simple procedure, you get it on that day or not or it takes longer or any new questions emerge, but we're pretty optimistic that this is going very, very smooth and we should be getting approval very rapidly here.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's very helpful. If I could ask one question to either you or Ganesh, impressive performance with Microchip 2.0 initiatives driving a 20% increase in parts per system board. As you look ahead to Microsemi, how does Microsemi impact that growth rate on your design wins on a per system board basis? Thanks, guys.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Go ahead, Ganesh.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So it's early days. What we are very encouraged by is the methodology that Microsemi uses for their equivalent of Total System Solutions. I showed some examples during the Investor Day on March 1, and they have an extremely well organized approach of how to take products from multiple business units and position them into the end markets that they're providing solutions for. And in the early discussions between the two companies, we have both identified places where each other's products can further strengthen those demo boards or reference designs or customer propositions that we can get.","So it's too early to tell you what the rate will be, but I am very encouraged by how the approach is common and the employees of the two companies are looking for ways to exploit that farther after the close.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Great, thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, now that we're working through the June quarter, can you just give us your best guess of combined seasonality for you guys plus Atmel for the September and December quarters, and then also maybe compare this deceleration that we've just seen versus the deceleration that occurred at the end of 2014?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I think \u2013 I don't really have numerical numbers for all the quarters for seasonality. I believe that the December and March quarters continue to be weak quarters, and June and September continue to be strong quarters, so we're guiding good sequential growth in June. And I would expect the same thing for September, and then December is usually the weakest quarter for the combined companies. And March, also driven by the Atmel seasonality, is slightly negative although this quarter we just announced was slightly positive. So I don't think that has changed, strong June, strong September, weakest December, and a weak March. Mind you, this is all going to change with Microsemi, whose seasonality we do not understand yet. And the second part of your question was what?","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, just compare the deceleration that we've seen with lead times coming in to what happened in 2014. We had a deceleration back then. It was obviously a little bit sharper, but it seems like the time period was roughly the same. Would you agree with that?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","2014 deceleration was driven by a significant slowdown in China that everybody saw. I don't recall what caused that. I think there were some government regulations change, reduced some of the subsidies from the various markets. There were a lot of things, and it was so clearly driven by China.","This deceleration is not driven by any place. World economies are synchronously going up, and I think the business environment is pretty good worldwide. This is just as the longer lead times are coming in, basically business is going back to normal, so I don't really think it's at all like 2014.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks. That's helpful.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Investors and analysts have been trying to compare this to 2014. Ever since we put the letter out on April last year, there has been the talk, everybody trying to compare it to 2014, and it's nothing like 2014. We've been telling you that this will soft-land, and I think you've got to give it to me that we have soft-landed it completely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, thank you, Steve, and congratulations, excellent results. So a perfect segue into my question, so now that the soft landing I think you said is complete, would you give us an idea of what you're thinking in terms of just your part of the business, not MSCC, but just your part of the business and how it plays out as far as growth is concerned? And I have a question that's a follow-up.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think it's the same question I just answered, strong June, strong September. You should see good results from us for this quarter and the next quarter, and then we go into a slow December and slow March. I think the numbers we have talked about before, mid to high single-digit growth, I think that's where we are and that's what the current guidance is, and I think the business has gone to normal after a soft landing.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Fair enough, Steve. And then your MCU business is pretty strong. I think you mentioned 2.5 times the growth rate. A lot of the large players play in the same markets as you. Everybody's targeting industrial and automotive, but you guys are doing substantially better. Is share take all of it, or are there other things going on, Steve, in your opinion?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Go ahead, Ganesh. Do you want to take that?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","A substantial portion of it is taking share. I think we're also consistent in an approach that isn't picking we're only going to do 32 bits and not focus on others. We are broad-based between 8 bits, 16 bits, and 32 bits. We find the spots that each of them succeed in. Each of them is growing. They're setting new records as they're growing. And so that breadth of what we have in solutions, how we go to market in many ways differentiates us from other people who may have a little different way of how they want to go to market. And I think the results show that, and year-in and year-out the market share has been growing, the position in that ranking has been growing. So I think there's no one silver bullet that's causing it, but our approach in go-to-market across the microcontrollers is contributing to the differentiated results in microcontrollers.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks, guys.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I would add to that, Harsh, that we are rapidly being perceived as the most reliable microcontroller supplier. They have seen significant challenges in delivery and other problems from our competitors both in Japan and Europe, and you know the names of those companies. Those companies have discontinued or end-of-life'd their large number of products from some of the companies they have merged with and created significant havoc at the customers. And the other company that is in play right now waiting for the China MOFCOM, they have seen significant dislocation or the customers have seen inconsistent supply and challenges.","Microchip absorbed a very large acquisition of Atmel and other companies we have bought before. And what we have done for the customer is then not end-of-life any of the microcontrollers. The customers have a very positive experience with us through all that, and so I think we are the preferred supplier, that's why.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Congratulations, guys. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you, and I echo my congratulations. Steve, I was wondering if we could shift the conversation away from inventory and distribution, et cetera, and characterize the demand environment from a qualitative perspective, what you're seeing in industrial IoT, automotive and ADAS, how that's maybe different from last year trends and going forward.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think the demand environment is really as normal as it can be described. There are always outliers, but the demand environment is normal. I just think last year, some of the lead times went out and the environment was more heated. After many, many years of low single-digit growth in the industry, last year industry growth was very positive. This year the growth is less than last year, but growth is still quite healthy, and the business environment is more normal this year than it was last year. I don't think anybody argues the industry can grow 13% \u2013 14% per year. That's what it grew last year, but this year seems to be more normal.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, got it, so more normalized growth rate versus last year. And then, Eric, in terms of the CapEx, is this kind of \u2013 the CapEx is going to change with Microsemi, but I'm wondering if you could give us some insight on how we should think about CapEx in fiscal year 2019 but also more on a longer-term basis.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So for fiscal 2019, we just guided today for CapEx to be between $200 million and $250 million for the year, but that includes about $70 million of building projects. And there can always be some building projects going on, but we've got four different projects around the world that are adding to that that set us up nicely for efficient growth going forward, and we reduce lease costs and things like that. So I'd call that one out of the ordinary. So if you take building projects out of the last fiscal year, fiscal 2018, as well as fiscal 2019, at $170 million to $175 million range for CapEx, I think that's normal in a growth environment.","If for any reason we saw growth decline, our maintenance CapEx is significantly lower than that, and we've seen how that can come down dramatically. But we're investing for growth, we're investing to bring manufacturing activities in house, which enhance our gross margin going forward and give us more control over the overall supply chain, so we'll continue to make those investments.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, got it, and just one question on deleveraging rapidly. Can you talk about any specific tranches that you're going to start taking out, what the impact will be on the interest expense in the near term and the medium term? Thanks.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I'll take that question. We're not ready to give specifics yet, but Steve did say in his prepared remarks that really all of our cash flow outside of what we have for investing in the business and CapEx and dividend will be used to rapidly delever. If you look at the combination of Microchip and Microsemi, these are two very high-quality, high-operating margin, high cash flow companies, and those models combined will improve from where they are on day one. And really all that cash generation over the first couple of years is absolutely going to be pay down debt and drive us to that 2.5 times leverage target that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So I don't have specifics by quarter or by year, but I think you can do your modeling and come up with a pretty good estimate.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You can see what we did with the Atmel delevering as well.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We're going to pay the highest interest first, kind of a no-brainer. And with some regards to looking at what's the fixed debt and what's the variable debt and basically a combination of paying down term loan and the line of credit, some combination of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates. Please go ahead.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Good morning and congratulations. On the Microsemi acquisition, I don't recall what you thought the earnings accretion might be year one and three. And as you did your due diligence, can you comment on any positive or negative surprises? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It's a very general question. Since we announced the transaction, we haven't seen any positive or negative surprises. During the diligence prior to announcement of the transaction, we didn't know as much about the company before, so we didn't really have a baseline against we could see that this was a positive or negative. But there always are as we went through various business units and corporate profiles, there were things we liked and the things we did not like. I think it will be probably a longer discussion to go into it, not a way to remember it (54:49) offhand.","I think the next step is when we close the transaction and then spend 90 days with the company, that's when we will see probably what we found as a positive or negative surprise. So probably ask that question in another couple of earnings calls later.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And maybe I can just add to that to refresh people's memory of what we said on March 1. Things haven't changed from that standpoint. We were assuming a June 2018 close, which is still our expectation. We had indicated that Microsemi would add $0.75 of non-GAAP EPS accretion on an annualized run rate basis in the first year after close, and in the third year after close that we would achieve $300 million in synergy from cost savings and revenue growth, and Microsemi would contribute $1.75 of non-GAAP EPS.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","All right. Thank you very much, congratulations.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Within your microcontroller business, what was the fastest-growing, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit? And is it units driving the growth or dollars?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Steve, I can take that. We don't break out growth rates for revenue by segment of the microcontrollers. As you can follow from the prepared remarks, all of them have been setting new records, so there's no one of them that is providing the growth that is offsetting any of the other ones. We're very happy with all three of them. And I think outside of that, there's nothing more to say.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, I know you don't break it out by end markets, but can you say what area of the world that you're seeing the best growth from?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So our growth is reflected in how revenue for the company is broken out by the regions of the world, so we have just under 20% in the Americas, just over 20% in Europe, and the balance is all in Asia. Now, Asian revenue reflects not only local consumption and local demand creation, but also represents business that is manufactured there for U.S. or other European companies, which then go back to the originating country. So that growth is very similar to the growth rates by end market, and the microcontrollers being such a dominant portion of Microchip at 65% revenue are going to be in the same range as what Microchip is growing in any of those regions of the world.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, this is Charlie Kazarian on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks for letting me ask a question today. I was hoping to dive a little bit deeper into the March quarter revenue. Specifically, you narrowed rev guidance on March 1 with a midpoint that was mostly unchanged. Could you just talk a little bit more about what specific buckets of revenue saw upside over the remaining month of the quarter? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't think we have that data by bucket. By buckets, I don't know whether you mean geographically buckets or you mean by end markets or you mean by product line?","Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just generically end markets or product lines or whatever you could provide would be helpful. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","End markets we don't know because on a quarterly basis, we cannot break our business by the end markets across 115,000 customers where 53% of the business is through distribution. So we only provide that data once in a while after we do some painstaking amount of work, so we don't really have the data by end market. By product line, Eric, any nuggets of where the extra growth came from?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Honestly, I think from March 1 to the close, we saw strength across really all of the product lines. They all performed well. You will definitely see that in the quarter the analog business performed better than the microcontroller business, but that was the opposite the quarter before that.","So Europe was very strong. That's typically what we see in the March quarter and it closed out strong, but I really don't think that we can peg it down like that, just good overall growth across the various product lines.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And we cleared some delinquencies that helped in the month of March, helped the growth that we had been expecting versus what we actually saw.","Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks, guys, and nice execution on the quarter. So I like the sell-through that you guys are going to report. I wish more people would do that as well. Perhaps you guys can describe how big that difference is between sell-through and sell-in that we've seen in the past.","And then, Steve, I almost get the sense that you philosophically are against sell-in. Some people think it creates bad behaviors. You're not going to incentivize your sales force on sell-in. I was wondering if you could talk about philosophically how you view that. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So you're absolutely correct. We are philosophically against sell-in because in sell-in, your relationship with distributors is built on commercial making the deals with the buyers in distribution to stuff the channel essentially. Hey, buy more of my parts, buy more of my parts. In a sell-through, the incentivization of the sales force to your effort is in driving design wins to revenue, so that the parts are going out from distributor shelves to the end customer, and that's the main difference.","Company after company that we've been involved in, the companies we have bought, Atmel and Micrel and others, they all had sell-in revenue recognition. And now we know their history, we have their records, we have their books, and the amount of managing the quarter that goes on at the end of the quarter by giving distribution deals, from pricing concessions to payment terms to buddy-buddy distribution, please take another $10 million from me, all that happens is really bad behavior, and it doesn't represent demand.","During the last few years as FASB was looking at defining revenue recognition, we fought that. I think we wrote a paper on it a long time ago, but FASB went down their decision where the revenue recognition for GAAP has to be sell-in. So we lost that battle, and so therefore, we have to announce GAAP based on sell-in, but we're not going to throw our religion away. We're going to manage the business based on sell-through. We're going to create demand. Our motto is drive design wins to revenue. We're going to incentivize our people. All bonus programs will be based on sell-through. We're going to measure distribution based on sell-through, but we'll go through an SEC-required GAAP exercise to report as sell-in.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great, thanks for that color, and thanks for offering sell-through. Going forward for me, OpEx was a tiny bit higher as a percentage of revenue. Perhaps just if you guys could, talk about where those investments are going, thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I don't think the changes are meaningful in terms of any conscious investments we made anywhere. I think it's just a large juggernaut, and there are lots of moving parts, exchange rates too. In the first quarter, you have some of the social security payments come back in for some of the people who are maxed out in the later quarters, and you could have slightly lower turnover, higher turnover and not being able to replace the people. So it's just a whole bunch of moving parts. There was really nothing \u2013 no conscious decisions were made to invest more or less.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks, guys.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you. Do you have anything to add, Eric?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I'm just going to add one thing onto that. So we've been operating below what Microchip has said has been our operating expense model. And to drive a 40% operating margin company, you have to make investments in R&D, in technical salespeople, in support functions and everything that goes into it. We have a lot of open requisitions in the company and we're going to continue to make those investments to make sure our business just isn't strong today but it's strong 3, 5, 10 years from now.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, great execution on the fiscal 2018 performance. The analog business drove about half of the incremental upside in the March quarter and it grew about 5% year over year. That's nice acceleration from the 1.5% growth in the prior quarter and a deceleration trend prior to that, and this is despite the reclassification headwinds. Is the year-over-year reacceleration a reflection of the increased attach rates you're achieving per program, as you highlighted at Analyst Day, or do you think it's just normal quarterly fluctuations?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So there's certainly some of that, which is a reflection of work we have done previously from an attach standpoint. And we've been telling you for several quarters that the headwind is only because of the way we reclassify it, but that the underlying fundamentals of the analog business and what we're doing to create growth and attach and all those other things remain intact.","Quarter to quarter you're going to see fluctuations on it, but I think the longer-term trend you should expect is that analog will have nice growth associated with what we can do with selling it as a part of our total system solutions.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the insights there. And aerospace and defense is only about 2% of core Microchip business pre-Microsemi. That percentage mix increases about 5.5x with Microsemi. I've heard that AMD is more sticky than your industrial products. I hear margins in AMD are better than industrial. First of all, would you agree with that? And does Microchip have a family of high-rel radiation-hardened MCUs, or is that something you guys hope to achieve with the Microsemi team? Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So clearly, the portion of our business that will be aerospace, defense, and space will grow up with Microsemi. It is very sticky business. It is high-margin business. And so in that sense, it joins the family of industrial and automotive and other product lines we have that have similar characteristics. Some of the work technically that we have to do also take advantage of what we have to do for industrial and automotive.","Specific to the rad-hard product line, yes, we do have rad-hard microcontrollers. Some of that work obviously started from Atmel and what they had been doing prior to the acquisition. And Microchip had been building more products that were ready for defense business but the rad-hard portion came really from the Atmel heritage. And it will grow significantly with Microsemi's portfolio, which is quite rich in other areas as well of defense and aerospace.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we have no additional questions.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.","James Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our April 1 acquisition of Supertex and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales on the March quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at a record $493.4 million and were up 2.3% sequentially from net sales of $482.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was a record $326.4 million from microcontrollers, $107.5 million for analog, $33.1 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $3.2 million of other.","Revenue by geography was a record $92.8 million in the Americas, a record $115.9 million in Europe and $284.6 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were above the high end of our guidance at 59.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below the low end of our guidance at 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was above the high end our guidance at 32.7% of sales and net income was a record $141.3 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance.","For fiscal 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $1.931 billion, and up 20.2% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 27.1% of sales, and operating income was 31.8% of sales. Net income was a record $531 million, or $2.45 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 58.9% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.7 million of share-based compensation, and $0.3 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisition of EqcoLogic, which closed in the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $164.5 million or 33.4% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $21.3 million, share-based compensation of $10.7 million, $0.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.5 million. The GAAP net income was $111.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $5.8 million.","For fiscal year 2014, GAAP gross margins were 58.4%, operating expenses were 34.7% of sales, and operating income was 23.8% of sales. Net income was $395.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted share. In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.8% and the GAAP tax rate was 5.7%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $5.8 million of nonrecurring favorable tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10% to 10.5%, which is lower than our previously communicated model. The tax rate will be slightly higher than this in Q1 of fiscal 2015, as we will not have integrated Supertex into Microchip's tax structure.","To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.101, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.026, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and other items were $0.002. The dividend declared today of $0.3555 per share will be paid on June 3, 2014 to shareholders of record on May 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.1 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 47th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We've never made a reduction in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 41st occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid is over $2.2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2014 was $262.7 million, or 118 days, compared to 126 days at the end of the December quarter. Excluding Supertex, we expect days of inventory at the end of the June quarter to be down between 7 and 11 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors stayed flat during the March quarter at 33 days and remains at low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. The combined overall inventory position of Microchip and its distributors is in great shape.","At March 31, the accounts receivable balance was $242.4 million, an increase by $18.1 million on a sequential basis due to the back-end weighting of the quarter due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Receivable balances remain in great condition.","The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the March quarter was a record $183.1 million prior to our dividend payment. The cash generation was favorably impacted by tax refunds received in the quarter of $28.6 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.14 billion, and we had $650 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $34.7 million for the March quarter and was $114.3 million for fiscal year 2014. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $125 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.","Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $23 million. I want to remind our investors and analysts that as Microchip's stock price rises, there is dilution for Microchip's outstanding convertible debt that come into the Microchip's diluted share count. There is a table on the supplemental financial information section of Microchip's Investor Relations site that walks through the level of dilution at various stock prices that you may find helpful. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table in today's press release assumes an average Microchip stock price in the June 2014 quarter of $48 per share. However, we make no predictions as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter and provide an update on the Supertex acquisition.","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.","Our overall microcontroller revenue grew 4.2% sequentially in the March quarter and was up 18.3% versus the year-ago quarter, achieving a new revenue record. For fiscal year '14, our microcontroller revenue was up 20.8% as compared to fiscal year '13, also achieving an all-time record. All 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit experienced sequential growth in the March quarter. And all 3 microcontroller segments achieved record revenue in fiscal year '14. Microcontrollers represented 66.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 16.4% sequentially in the March quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 38.3% versus the year-ago quarter, and for fiscal year '14, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 44.2% as compared to fiscal year '13. Fiscal year '14 marks the 9th consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 16-bit microcontroller business. We now have over 400 16-bit microcontroller products in our portfolio and this business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 7% sequentially in the March quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 66% versus the year-ago quarter. And for fiscal year '14, our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 73% as compared to fiscal year '13. Fiscal year '14 marks the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 32-bit microcontroller business. We now have well over 100 32-bit microcontroller products in our portfolio and we're continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs, and expand into new fields of play, like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Gartner Dataquest just released a microcontroller market share report for 2013. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain significant share versus the 8-bit market at large and versus our nearest competitors. Three years ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas 8-bit business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than our 8-bit microcontroller business. In 2013, this lead had shrunk to less than 0.5%. I fully expect that we will wrest back the #1 position in 8-bit microcontrollers in 2014.","In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2013. We also moved up to the #5 spot in 2013, and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years.","In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #11 spot in 2013, and we were the fastest-growing major 32-bit microcontroller franchise among the top competitors. Gartner Dataquest report is a backward-looking indicator where we're performing very well.","Now let's look at a forward-looking indicator. In early April, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions, and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where some have had questions about our choice of core. Our 2013 market results as well as the 2013 design engineering preference results echo market confirmation of our belief about customers care about, is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important.","Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we have seen reported by our competitors in their results. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now let's move to analog products. After 9 consecutive quarters of sequential growth, our analog business took a pause and was down 1.3% sequentially in the March quarter. However, analog revenue was up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter, and for fiscal year '14, our analog business was up 32% as compared to fiscal year '13, easily one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry. Analog revenue represented 21.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Moving to our memory business. This business is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, and was sequentially up 2%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","Now a short update about Supertex and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on February 10, we have spent considerable time understanding Supertex's business, organization and systems. We have developed a detailed integration plan that we have begun to execute starting April 1 when we closed the transaction. Supertex will run as one of our analog product groups, otherwise known as divisions, focused on markets and applications that value high-voltage analog and mixed signal capability. We believe a number of Supertex's current products and future roadmap have broader market appeal than how they have been marketed, and we are taking steps to capitalize on this opportunity.","In regards to manufacturing, Supertex does have a leased 6-inch fab, but had already started to move many of their products to foundries for better competitiveness. We are evaluating whether some of the products planned for movement to the foundries can be redirected to Microchip's fabs instead. Supertex subcontracts 100% of its assembly and over 60% of its test volume. We are doing a make-versus-buy analysis and evaluating whether some of the products currently outsourced by Supertex can be brought into our internal assembly and test operations. Microchip will transition all Supertex back-end manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses to our systems. We estimate that this transition will be complete sometime in the third calendar quarter of 2014, at which time all Supertex products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems.","Regarding sales of field applications, we are planning to keep Supertex's sales and applications engineers and will cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies. We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. Some distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while some are different, our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies.","Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, more specifics about the Supertex acquisition, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll will first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and the whole of the fiscal 2014, then I'll will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2015.","We are very pleased with our execution in the March quarter, as well as fiscal year 2014, all of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were better than the midpoint of our guidance. Our operating profit percentage was 32.7% and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.64 and was $0.03 better than the midpoint of our guidance.","We made the following new all-time records: total net sales; total microcontroller sales; 16-bit microcontroller sales and 32-bit microcontroller sales. All made fresh all-time records in the quarter. Geographically, our net sales in the Americas and Europe made all-time new records in the quarter in the non-GAAP financials of our gross margin dollars, operating profit dollars, net income dollars and earnings per share, all made fresh all-time records in the quarter. On a full fiscal year basis, our overall net sales in fiscal 2014 were a record $1.93 billion and were up 20.2% over net sales in fiscal year 2013, marking an excellent year of market share growth compared to a low single-digit growth for the industry.","","In fiscal year '14, we achieved new records on every strategic product line, 8-bit MCUs, 16-bit MCUs, 32-bit MCUs, and total MCUs, analog, as well as licensing. They all made records in fiscal 2014. Yes, we shipped a record 8-bit microcontrollers also in fiscal year 2014. We also made new records in each of the geographies of Americas, Europe and Asia also. Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 94th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding year for microchip.","On April 1, we closed the acquisition of Supertex. I will provide more guidance on Supertex a bit later and provide the overall guidance.","So now the fiscal first quarter 2015 guidance. The June quarter started with a good backlog position. There is usually sequential growth coming out of Asia because of the effect of Lunar New Year in the March quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect the June quarter net sales to be up 5.3% to 8.3% sequentially. Now this includes about $16.5 million of sales coming from Supertex. Without Supertex, Microchip classic business is expected to be up between 2% to 5% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59.3% and 59.5% of sales. Classic Microchip gross margin is expected to improve to about 59.5% to 60% of sales. But the short-term gross margin is slightly negatively impacted from the consolidation of Supertex. Supertex took the underutilization of their fab and capitalized it in their inventory. Microchip does accounting more conservatively and will charge the underutilization in the current quarter. Longer term, we expect to improve Supertex's gross margin to Microchip levels. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.6% and 27% of sales, and we expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.9% of sales, again, slightly negatively impacted by Supertex short term. Longer term, we expect Supertex's operating margins to be similar to those of Microchip's. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.64 and $0.68 per share, including the accretion from Supertex.","Now regarding Supertex, Ganesh provided you an update, on where we are on the integration process. Supertex will provide about $0.01 accretion in the June quarter, which we expect will go to about $0.02 accretion by the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect the accretion by the end of the second year to be at a rate of about $0.03 per quarter or about $0.12 per year run rate. These numbers are non-GAAP and they depend on the pace of integration and general market conditions, which will impact Supertex's and Microchip's business.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Paik","This is Andrew Paik on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks again for providing us on the expected accretion levels from Supertex. I was wondering if you could help us understand what kind of gross margin and operating margin you're embedding in your calculation relative to the $0.02 accretion you are expecting exiting the second full year.","Steve Sanghi","Is the question short term? Or what we are embedding, longer term and year out?","Andrew Paik","It's the longer-term, it's relative to the $0.02 accretion you provided for exiting the second full year after the acquisition.","Steve Sanghi","They're very much similar to Microchip's gross margin level, 60% plus kind of range.","Andrew Paik","Got it. And as my follow-up, I think, it will be helpful if you could provide us how -- if you saw any strengths, I guess better-than-expected strengths in any particular end market during the March quarter. You have an outside exposure to auto, industrial and housing, so perhaps, it will be helpful if you could provide us -- help us in this and how those end markets perform during the March quarter relative to your expectations heading into the quarter?","Steve Sanghi","Well, the answer is really kind of all of the above that you mentioned. Housing, auto, industrial, they've been all been small markets. You have heard commentary from other manufacturers and ours was similar. We do not track our business for end markets. We are not organized that way. We have a very broad customer base of 80,000-plus customers. So we could just basically say that, generically, those are the stronger end markets today, and our business has really benefited from those exposures.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","First question, I wonder if you could talk a little bit with regard to the Supertex accretion. And as you get to the final $0.12 a year that you expect, how much of that contribution do you expect from cost synergies, improving the margins, getting the margins up to Microchip levels as compared to some of the improved revenue growth, because I think both -- you are looking to make progress on both fronts there?","Steve Sanghi","That's correct. We are planning to make progress in both fronts. It's only been 1 month. We closed the deal on April 1. So in such a short time, we're really not able to provide you further breakdown of really where some of the synergies could come from. There are synergies out of wafer manufacturing, synergies out of assembly and test, synergies out of OpEx overhead, and synergy out of increased sales at the existing new customers by -- we have already seen and evaluated that Supertex products were marketed to a relatively narrower group of customers. And they have a tremendous high-voltage expertise and some of the products have a much broader reach, and we'll win the designs into broad Microchip 80,000-plus customers with many other broad-based products. So it's really all of the above.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And with regard to the results and guidance. If you could go into a little detail about why there was divergence between the analog and the microcontroller business in the March quarter? I suppose perhaps that's some of the seasonality of some of your acquired businesses, but if you could go into a little bit of detail there? And what your expectation is for analog versus microcontroller as you go into the June quarter?","Steve Sanghi","We don't break out our guidance by the various product lines. But looking back at it, the March quarter, analog has grown now straight for about 9 quarters. And cumulatively over that period, actually analog growth has been a little higher than microcontrollers. So not every quarter always perfectly falls in its place. And the large number of moving things and seasonality of different business lines, different customers are different. It's somewhat also impacted by the acquired businesses, which have slightly different seasonality than our own like you mentioned. So those were the numbers in March and we don't break it out going forward. The analog business historically is very strong in the first quarter -- fiscal first quarter, so this quarter you should see positive analog results.","Ganesh Moorthy","If you go back in our history, you'll also see there've been quarters where 16-bit has taken a pause or 32-bit has taken a pause, so over the long run and as you look at our fiscal year over fiscal year, they all look very good. But at any given quarter, we can have a pause for any of the segments.","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, and just point out that analog in the December quarter was an all-time record revenue, so just backing off to slightly from that.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens Incorporated.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","We -- Steve, we've always valued your commentary on the end markets. There was a question asked earlier. I'm curious if you have a mid- to longer-term prognosis based on what you're seeing or your views on the semi cycle at this time.","Steve Sanghi","I'm surprised you value my commentary on the end markets because [ph] I don't get any.","James Eric Bjornholt","I think he's talking about just semiconductor program, the cycle.","Steve Sanghi","Yes, but you're talking about the general semiconductor cycle?","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That is correct. That is correct.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I think cycle is still on the way up. There are no major cyclical headwinds visible today. You're seeing a strong Europe recovering, all the peripheral countries are doing better. Europe was up -- huge for us in the March quarter. U.S. is doing well, we made record revenue both in U.S. and Europe in the March quarter. And for a -- on a year basis, all geographies were record -- U.S., Europe and Asia. Asia was down in the March quarter, largely because of the Lunar New Year, and Asia would make another record in the June quarter. So I think, geographies are doing well, end markets are doing well, our business is doing well. We're gaining share. The inventories and the channel as well as -- at Microchip are very reasonable. We had 118 days of inventory. We're guiding down inventory by another 7 to 11 days. So I think, things are in reasonably good shape. There will eventually be a cycle, but I don't think it's from the next quarter or 2.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I can ask a question. You briefly touched on Internet of Things, IoT, and that's like a new, big buzz word now. I'm curious if your strategy of sort of getting into that market and growing your business, your beachhead will be the microcontroller business or the analog business or something else?","Ganesh Moorthy","Yes, so we're not getting into the business. We've been in it for a long time. So let me kind of paint how the business looks to us. Many, many, many of these devices that are trying to be connected to the Internet are products in which we have designed in our standard microcontrollers and our analog products for many years. The 4 major components that enable our customers to achieve connectivity to the Internet and be part of the Internet of Things are the computing capability, which is all microcontrollers. The analog functionality, which goes hand in hand in many of their systems. The wireless connectivity and the associated software and firmware that goes with it, which establishes the connectivity through different medium. And finally, the ability to get on to the cloud, which is really where we partner with external partners who will bring that capability, so that they're scalable cloud services that are available to these same customers. So a lot of the people who are achieving connectivity of the Internet are the people who we have dealt with for many years, have their designs, and are winning their new designs as they take the next step of getting to Internet connectivity.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Harsh. I'd like to add one other comment there. I think Microchip fights and defends a very, very broad beachhead. And our $2 billion business doesn't tend to be dependent on neither a single vertical market or single stuff like Internet of Things or anything like that. We are in hundreds and hundreds of appliances, thousands of applications. So as a result, any one given thrust [ph] doesn't get as much air time. But if you look at today, the connectivity of thermostats to washing machines to laundry equipment to garage-door openers to security systems, Microchip is providing the backbone, the microcontroller, the analog, the Wi-Fi, the connectivity, the software and everything to connect these things to Internet. So -- and we have a substantial business in that area, but we don't go out there and say we are pure play in Internet because that's neither true, nor is something we would like. Our business is very broad-based.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Can you talk about your cash position? How much is onshore and how much is offshore? And what's the trend, is there a -- Supertex helped to bring more cash onshore?","James Eric Bjornholt","Okay, sure, I can answer that. So the vast majority of Microchip's cash is offshore. We have our line of credit that's outstanding, which is about $650 million and we've tapped into that line of credit for our strategic opportunities, specifically the SMSC acquisition in the past and now it will be the Supertex acquisition in the current quarter that we're in. But the vast majority of our cash is offshore. Supertex, we don't expect to really improve the onshore cash generation. It will improve the overall cash generation. But their business profile in terms of how much is offshore versus onshore is similar to what Microchip's is, so it should really maintain that structure.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And is there any other strategy to bring cash back onshore?","James Eric Bjornholt","No, there is not another strategy at this point in time. The domestic cash generation that we have, it supports the dividend program, it supports the investments that we need to make in our ongoing business. But the strategic activity for acquisitions -- we'll continue to look at ways to do those things in a cash-effective manner, but each acquisition is different but that's something that is evaluated with each one.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with ABR.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","I had a question for you, though, about the sequence of revenues into this quarter. Traditionally, when you look at your seasonal patterns over the last several years and even the last couple of years, we've seen a stronger uptick in the March quarter -- sorry, in the June quarter. And it seemed like that might even have been bigger this year because of the steeper drop you faced in March because of the new exposure to China New Year and Asia consumer electronics. Do you have a sense for -- or do you see any drivers as to why we didn't see that stronger bounce back in the organic growth of Microchip excluding Supertex or if there are any order pull-ins that explain your above-guidance results last quarter that could help us understand that sequential softness, I guess, here in June?","Steve Sanghi","I guess we're not looking at June. We are not interpreting them to be soft. If you, in fact, take the March to June results for the last 3 years, you will see that the average growth in net sales that we have experienced in the June quarter over the past 3 years is right in line with a 3.5% guidance. And then add Supertex to that, about $16.5 million, and that's really sort of the formation. So it's not really weaker than the prior. The case you're making is, why is it not stronger. I seem to recall that same industrial, auto and consumer were in the play last year also and there were quite strong. Our last June quarter was pretty good, too. So I think, it's been about a year that these end markets have been stronger, it's really not a new thing. In addition, not really any pull-ins, but we beat the March quarter from the original midpoint of guidance of 1.5%, so we're starting with a higher base.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Right, that's helpful. And then on the order pattern or the pace of business, can you give us any color on how orders might have evolved over the last few months or over the course of March and then beginning here the June quarters, whether you are seeing any expedited orders or any push-outs? And whether that's prompting you to increase capacity utilization at your fabs?","Steve Sanghi","Okay. That's a good question. Our order pattern is very strong. I mean, noticeably the overall total backlog has a steep slope upwards, but the backlog is not aging all in the June quarter. We're getting more longer-term orders somewhat related to just overall strong orders. So the lead times are not short on many of the products. So with the environment being stronger in industrial, auto, consumers and others, pretty broad-based from all geographies. We are seeing customers willing to place orders more out in time than they historically are. Partially because customers have also got to know that June, September are stronger quarters and they have seen in the previous years, when I was writing these letters, then posting them on the web to customers all the time, leading up to this time, asking the customers to place their longer-term backlog and they always saw the orders or the lead time push out and some customers were stranded with very short inventory. This time I didn't write the letter because we were basically getting very strong orders and with a very good outlook in the future. Some of the orders of going all the way into October, November, December. So order patterns are very strong and we should have good visibility, which will stage for a good June and a good September.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","And on capacity utilization, is that moving higher?","Steve Sanghi","So capacity utilization is moving higher. We have increased the wafer starts in our fab, and that's reflected in our guidance where I said the core Microchip or the classic Microchip without Supertex, gross margin midpoint is about 59.7%, which is substantially higher than the March. But we have a slight negative effect of the Supertex integration in the first quarter because their gross margin is lower and by the end of the year or so, we'll get them pretty good. But there's a short-term impact and our capacity utilization is increasing quite a bit in the back-end, all the way from wafer on, in probe and assembly and test. And we're adding substantial new equipment in all stages in fab probe, assembly, test, which is reflected in our $40 million of capital expense budget we have forecasted for the current June quarter.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the 32-bit market, the company continues to see steady share gains from a small base. Can you just update your thoughts on just the positioning within MIPS? And I know you also have an on license with the SMSC deal and just how you see that 32-bit market for you [ph] evolving?","Ganesh Moorthy","Well, we don't position our products to be MIPS or ARM or anything else. We position to be PIC32 microcontrollers. So we have our standard microcontroller portfolio of PIC32 products with well over 100 products in the portfolio. Its breadth of solutions available has been growing, contributing to a higher number of opportunities that we can serve. As we told you back in November, we have some of the highest-performance microcontrollers, some of the best code efficiency microcontrollers and a whole software platform that we have called MPLAB Harmony to enable that. And the success is coming from focusing on customers and applications rather than focusing on cores and architectures.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Appreciate the color there. And Steve, if I could on the SMSC deal, it's been highly accretive. Any thoughts on just kind of what the biggest positive surprise is as you digested that deal have been, and then any other things that you're still working that you see as opportunity going forward?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we pretty much nailed it in that case. I mean, we highlighted significant accretion that we were going to get from various operating expenses, their operating expense was over 40% of sales compared to really what Microchip numbers have been. Their gross margin was a lot lower, and therefore combined together, their operating margin was about 12% in the full year before we bought them. And then now really in the Microchip range, so we've gotten improvement from gross margin, we've gotten improvement from operating expenses and we've gotten also improvement from taking some of their products that they were largely positioning them only in the vertical market, like USB was mainly in the computing market and Internet was mainly in the computing market. And with the Microchip broad customer base, we have been able to take them more broadly into set-top boxes and industrial and appliances and other stuff. So a lot of that has happened. There is still some more accretion to grow by the consolidation of assembly and test into Microchip facilities. I think we're only about half done.","Ganesh Moorthy","Half done.","Steve Sanghi","So only about half done and that basically slowed down because the environment recovered very strongly, and we got more busy really ramping the core Microchip stuff, microcontrollers and analog to our probe, assembly and test facilities, which was more important because it was incremental business. And now we have Supertex on our plate, so we're really trying to transfer some of the Supertex assembly and test also to our facilities. So there's a lot on the plate. There is plenty of opportunity to transfer the rest of SMSC, to transfer the Supertex and to keep growing our own business. That's a good thing. There's a lot of opportunity. But we haven't been able to fully complete it because the environment turned strong and we got busy growing our own business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","If you could update us a little bit on the competitive dynamics in the microcontroller market. As you know, there are other companies' flash vendors that have kind of moved into the microcontroller market through acquisitions. Wondering kind of what your thought process overall of the competitive landscape in that market. And along those same lines, do you anticipate that there could be some consolidation in that market over time because it's fairly fragmented?","Steve Sanghi","Well, I'll make some comments and maybe Ganesh can add something to it. I think, the competitor you're mentioning is the one that brought a business from Japan. We are seeing 0 competition from this manufacturer. We never competed with their Japanese business before, and a lot of noise is being made. But there is really not in our customer base, really not seeing it. It's a memory company, it has been, and they bought some microcontroller and analog business, and they do well over time, but more likely, they're going to compete with some of the other Japanese companies like Renesas and Toshiba and others. But we're really not seeing any competition from them, so they have not changed the dynamics of either the microcontroller or the analog business even one iota.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And do you -- could you kind of talk a little bit about the penetration of ARM in the microcontroller market? Do you see that accelerating at a faster rate? Or is it kind of in line with the kind of the previous thinking?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh, do you want take that?","Ganesh Moorthy","We almost don't care. We're not focused on what the core is. We're focused on what our customer needs, what are applications we can focus on, how do we serve it with a PIC32 microcontroller, how do we provide the entire ecosystem to enable that customer to grow. So we're really not fixated on what the core should be and -- nor do we find the key customers we're working with fixated on that. Do we use an ARM core for some of our specialized microcontrollers? Of course. They came that way through the acquisitions we've made. We've left them there because that made sense, not because it was an ARM core, but because it was the most effective way that we can serve those customers. So our whole focus begins and ends with understanding customer needs and positioning and providing solutions that satisfy those needs, cost-effectively and competitively.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And just last question on that 32-bit. If you look at kind of the market share data and maybe we need to update it, but I think you're kind of #5 or #6 in that range. And #1 is Renesas, NEC and then, I think #2 is Freescale. What is the intention or what are the plans to try to move up that market share scale?","Ganesh Moorthy","Well, you just saw what we did in the last fiscal year.","Steve Sanghi","Well, you named Renesas and NEC, they're really one.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I'm saying Renesas\/NEC.","Steve Sanghi","So Renesas is 1 and Freescale is 2. In the Dataquest chart, I think we were #4, and we were $6 million away from #3. And we have come from way behind. So unless you're new to Microchip, I mean, if you look at over 10 years, the company that has gained the most share really would be us.","Ganesh Moorthy","And if you look at our microcontroller business, it grew 20% plus in the last fiscal year. Take a look at the entire list of microcontroller players and see if you can find anybody, anywhere close to that in the top of the list. And so we are gaining significant share, we have been every year and we move up relentlessly through the charts in each of 8, 16, 32 and in totality for all microcontrollers.","Steve Sanghi","Now this data just came out yesterday and I've had a chance to analyze it. I didn't dial it in my commentary because it was long, because we combined both quarterly results and the annual results, so I didn't speak about it. But our 32 business -- 32-bit microcontroller, 16-bit as well as 8-bit, they all 3 of them outgrew the industry growth. Our 32-bit microcontroller business blew away the growth of the industry. So -- I think we keep saying that in answer to question after question, though we don't really care about the core. Our customers don't buy the parts because of the core. They buy the parts because they're looking for a microcontroller solution. And in PIC32, it doesn't matter what core it is based on, provides them instead of performance and peripherals and software ecosystem, FAEs and system and support that they require to complete their parts and go to production.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to clarify some of the points you've made on the manufacturing side. It sounds like, as you've talked about the consolidation opportunities, off of the deals that you've done and with Supertex that it's really more on the back-end to -- with assembly and test to bring things in-house, but one, is that true? And is there more of an opportunity than what I thought I heard to consolidate more on the front-end as well and if so, what would that do to the percent of in-source versus out-sourced front-end work for you?","Steve Sanghi","I think, the back-end coming inside, comes a little easier. And they're easier qualifications and all that. They're bringing the front-end up from the required [ph], bringing process technologies. You may or may not have inside, depending on the lithography, it requires much larger capital investment and equipment. So in the case of SMSC, their products were on a much more leading-edge lithographies and we have not brought any of the SMSC in-house on the front-end. There are a few products we can and over time we might, but there we haven't. As far as Supertex is concerned, they were a much more of high-voltage company and their products were not on leading-edge lithographies. They've got a lot of 0.5 micron, 1 micron, 2 micron, even 3 micron products. So much more high-voltage oriented rather than push the lithography [ph]. And so many of the Supertex products are being evaluated for bringing to our fabs and many of them, they will come into our fab. But Supertex, from a revenue standpoint, was a smaller acquisition. I don't think it moves the needle that much inside versus outside. But yes, a lot of their products will. I mean, their inside today, they're in -- they're in their own fab. But it's a smaller 6-inch fab and we're evaluating bringing some of those products through a Microchip 8-inch fab.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","And then the follow-up question is more on the growth rate of the business, and I'll throw in a clarification with that. So given all the changes to the portfolio, both constructive organically, given the growth of the 32- and 16-bit businesses and the acquisitions that you've done, how do you think about the growth rate of your business now relative to the broader analog industry? And just a clarification on the revenue side, Eric, should we expect that the Supertex business really goes into the analog commentary that you typically provide quarterly or some of that and some of the other segments that you would comment on?","James Eric Bjornholt","Yes, so the Supertex acquisition will be reported as part of our analogs products group in the public reporting. Steve, I don't know if you want to address the other question, but he is asking about our growth versus industry growth and what's the projection could be? I mean, if you take out the Supertex acquisition, year-over-year results at the midpoint of our guidance is about 10.3% up, in the June quarter, which is absolutely in front of what the industry is doing. Craig, did you have a longer-term question?","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Yes, it was a more of a longer-term question and the -- whether or not, the acquisitions that you've done have really altered the growth rate of the portfolio and enhanced the growth rate of the portfolio sustainably versus industry?","Steve Sanghi","Well, but you also, growing on a larger and larger base -- our business now, last year was $1.93 billion. The current quarter guidance puts out at -- puts us at, what, $2.0 billion -- or $2.1 billion, so you're growing on a much, much larger base. I'm really -- I can't really comment on the longer-term growth rate. I think this question has constantly been asked for a decade -- and without answering the question, you could look back and do any kind of analysis and we have beaten the growth rate of the industry over a short-term, long-term or over any horizon in market share gains organically, and in addition with the acquisitions. And we recently -- that's our goal to continue to do so.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn it back to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. Some of you will see Eric Bjornholt at JPMorgan Conference in Boston. That's the next conference we go to. So thank you very much.","James Eric Bjornholt","Bye-bye.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"14888":["Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call February  3, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Steve Sanghi - Chairman & CEO","Eric Bjornholt - CFO","Ganesh Moorthy - President & COO","Analysts","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","William Stein - SunTrust","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Harsh Kumar - Stephens Investment Banking","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I would like to begin by saying how proud and pleased I am to be promoting Ganesh Moorthy to President and Chief Operating Officer. I am not going anywhere, and I will remain as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. I will say more about it later in my comments, and let me know first pass this call to Eric Bjornholt who will walk you through our financial results. Eric?","Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition, and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million, and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell and revenue recognition contracts that Micrel previously had for certain of those distribution partners.","We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64 which was higher than our pre-announced results from January 19.","On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisitions and related expenses were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory evaluation cost and acquisition related restructuring cost.","Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition related expenses, and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share.","In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefit in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015 was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is up by five days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down one day from the September quarter levels.","I want to remind you that historically Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all of the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future.","Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with a view of the true end-market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the date of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.","The cash generation in the December quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30 as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to the street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.","Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders has been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying in the U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income. As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of the IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website which indicates the split between taxable dividends and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Steve, our Board of Directors, the Microchip Executive Team, and the over 10,000 employees of Microchip worldwide for the high honor and the distinct privilege they have bestowed on me to be the next President of Microchip. It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.","Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our products lines starting with Microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015 our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014, and while we're not happy about the decline we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.","We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and development tool solutions to compliment them which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontrollers family we expect will enhance Microchip's industry leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","Moving to Analog, our Analog business which includes Micrel results was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and was up 3.6% compared to the year ago quarter. In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts, as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been.","To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009, and at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded controlled market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.","Now moving to the Memory business, our memory business which is comprised of our Serial E-Squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products was down 8.3% in the December quarter, as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel. Then I will provide some further commentary on some of the feedback we have received since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel.","Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64 which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.","I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holidays in Asia but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.","Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned, there were seven main elements of integration we had defined. Five of them are complete which are; number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of salesforce rep and distribution network; number four, integration of products lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401K, medical benefits, bonus plans etcetera.","The remaining two areas which are progressing well but are not complete yet are; number one, the closure of Micrel San Jose fab which is on-schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of backend operational systems which also remains on-schedule for August of 2016.","With this let me know provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.07 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS. This accretion will continue to increase and we now believe that we will achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the help of the underlying economy in general.","Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose, and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I are headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and UK. We completed the U.S. Antitrust Filing last week and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the F4 filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.","Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction and our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts has been very positive that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further questions. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment, that in the current slow growth environment investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment.","We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last six years to repeat just under metric from calendar 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth including acquisitions has been 17.3% per year. Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful.","Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised. First is leverage. Investors have raised a concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and understandably have questions about the cash quotient and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergy. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their coated leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows.","After the first year the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3, and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After two years the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after three years the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first three years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the Board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risk to the dividend.","The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also but we have continued to receive follow-on question about this. The comment from investors has been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now?","When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture it was in response to investors question about replacing our PIC32 architecture which is MIPS based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32 based solutions are differentiated in superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shell one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution, and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.","By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM based products to be a commodity, nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM32 based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right, and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems, and they can continue to coexist.","There are PIC head engineers who like PICs and there are AVR freaks, a group on the web who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistakes that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical products lines and automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market and sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.","The third question raised has been revenue dis-synergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's products lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductors.","While in 2008 Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor, I must point out that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those two businesses was affordability, not the margin. ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then Microchip has grown tremendously, and with a large market capitalization. Today we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves.","Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margins businesses, namely Smart Card, CDL Flash Memory business and some others. Today we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of that 5% business which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.","Fourth question raised has been dis-synergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same circuit and therefore there will be some dis-synergy. We do not understand this concern due to different architectures Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are never designed into the same circuit. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio, we don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas instruments business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do.","Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through their distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought after broad-based product line with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching Analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.","The fifth concern raised has been -- our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19, this bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about the accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from three factors. First, the operating expense reduction. Second, the gross margin improvement. And third, the revenue growth.","The operating expense reduction is not a one year job, because of the size of the transaction we believe it will be a continuous effort over a three-year period to rationalize the R&D, as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency, as well as higher or lower emphasis on products lines based on their gross margin. And then there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy.","Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last five years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business, and they also sold the serial flash business with company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will widen [ph] in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attached opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. A combination of all these factors builds the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.","The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal. Now I must say that we heard this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4X larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is a $2.2 billion company and is capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us which was unlike the case with SFT, SMSC etcetera.","As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategy to meet the challenges of a given time. Just today we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of the promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide.","We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. Through training, mentoring, and developing we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced.","You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns.","In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for us for this correction and we are expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter we get into two back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters beyond organic growth will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple effect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017.","With this operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first question to Vivek Arora [ph] at Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. Steve you mentioned March as seasonal, and I think you said China down and I believe Europe and perhaps U.S. up. Given that you have exposure to such a large range of customers, what are you hearing from your customers just in terms of your specific demand environment? Do you think it appears normal or do you think there are ways versus what you would have thought entering this year? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","The demand environment in U.S. and Europe is about normal. The demand environment in China has been weaker than normal but we were the first ones to call the weakness in China which the industry has been experiencing for some time now. And we have modeled that weakness of China and especially also because of the Chinese New Year into our guidance that we have provided today.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And the fact that probably squeezing just a quick follow-up on just microcontroller segment growth in calendar '15, I think you mentioned you gained share and assume that there were likely tailwinds from IoT and autos and other area. But then how do we explain the sales actually being down somewhat year-on-year? Was it an inventory issue? Was it geographic issue? Like one should have expected your sales to grow if you were gaining share and you had tailwinds from a number of these new secular road [ph] segment? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Well, that depends on what the total number were for microcontrollers. As we have monitored the numbers and earnings report coming out from various other companies, the microcontrollers have been down significantly. So I think once the Dataquest numbers come out, Gartner data come out, you can see what has happened to the market share. We have tracked our performance against the SIA which come out more routinely and we have shown it to you at certain conferences and the grass has looked up into the right where we have been gaining share. Now gaining share doesn't necessarily mean that the numbers are up year-over-year, you could gain share with flat or 1% down business if the business shrunk more than that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Harlan Sur at JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question and Ganesh, congratulations on the promotion. On the $0.05 more of accretion you're targeting on an annualized basis exiting fiscal year '17, just wondering is that better synergies on the COG side or OpEx side or combination of both?","Steve Sanghi","It's combination of three factors; better synergies on the OpEx, better synergies on the gross margin that we can now anticipate as we are getting closer to closing the fab, and we're also seeing significant revenue synergies as we have really taken their product line to our distribution and broad-based direct customers. We're seeing -- we are modelling some revenue synergies also. So $0.05 is a small difference but not that small either, $0.05 would be $11 million to $12 million on an annualized basis and that's how much better we are seeing Micrel today than we saw just a quarter ago.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for the insight there, Steve. And then automotive, was there a relative and bright spot in the December quarter, I think we saw the -- number had a pretty strong snap out. I think you called it a relatively bright spot in your business last quarter. How do you see your broad automotive end markets trending here in the March quarter?","Steve Sanghi","Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Automotive was strong as you noted in the December quarter and continues to be a stronger segment than some of the other ones. It's consistent with what you've seen and in the other reports about automotive. It remains one of the more resilient market segments even in the broad-based weakness.","Harlan Sur","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Pitzer at Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Ganesh, congratulations as well. You did a good job in the December quarter taking inventory down. In the press release you talked about growing inventory in the March quarter, and Steve, I'm wondering if you could just help me understand is that kind of normal seasonal or is that sort of a habitu\u00e9 [ph] of kind of your expectations for demand as you look beyond March. Give me the explanation behind the inventory going back up in the March quarter?","Eric Bjornholt","John, this is Eric. So we had some extended shutdowns in the December quarter in our wafer fab that aren't going to repeat in the March quarter and that's the biggest change that's happened quarter-on-quarter.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. Maybe I could sneak another one in. I guess Steve, the farm [ph] what you assumed Micrel did in the December quarter is going to do in the March quarter. It does look if you back that out as if the year-over-year growth for the core business is down, anywhere from 6% to 8% in December and down again 6% to 8% year-over-year at March which does seem to be lagging the peers. Now I know in your prepared remarks you said you feel confident that you're gaining share, I'm just hoping maybe you can help elaborate on that.","And I think you also put the qualifier in there, in the markets that you address. And so help me understand, do you think that your served addressable market is growing slower than the overall addressable market for market controllers and that's one of the reasons for the disconnect?","Steve Sanghi","I think in trying to calculate those percentages you are probably highly off on the Micrel revenue. Our numbers are in front of me where we could follow it offline. I don't believe your calculations are correct.","John Pitzer","Okay. Could you just talk to in general why you're so confident that you're not losing share, that you're actually gaining share Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Well, when we look at -- compare our 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit against SIA numbers we're confident that we gained share in 8-bit, we gained share in 16-bit, we gained share in 32-bit, and we clearly gained share in analog because there has been a significant growth in analog. We have declined some in the memory business; we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies already did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with this six inch fabs, they under loaded and they attempt to take odds and ends of foundry business doing some work for other people which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it, it's going to be small amount of work. When you close the fab that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business, also Supertex had it, Micrel had it. We put that all in the other, so I think when you look at all that our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renaissance [ph], you can compare it to anybody else and when the numbers come out from Gartner we can share that with you.","John Pitzer","Helpful, thanks guys.","Steve Sanghi","I think other thing John I would say is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. You know the thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work, we take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort would have gone into our business.","In many cases -- take the case of Micrel for example, we terminated one of our product, a Gigabit Ethernet and we decided to take a Gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were further along in the development of that product. So when you look at it year, two years, three years down the line -- when you guys, the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions which were essentially making new -- no money, and make hundreds of millions of dollars from these acquisitions to bring them into 30% plus operating profit, and you take them out from the cap and saying our core business isn't doing well, thank you very much.","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach at Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Steve, just question on Atmel, you mentioned that you will be doing some visits and you meet with some of the executives into Colorado, just -- I just start to do these meetings, any additional color you'd provide in terms of kind of what you're learning incrementally about the business and how that fits into the deal?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we're not learning much about the business at this point in time. Atmel is essentially not shedding anything about the business. We still see that Antitrust hasn't cleared and we still see the businesses as competitive. We're largely getting through the people, we tour the facility, we're learning where people are located, we're starting to formulate some initial thoughts about how we will go about the integration. We have done enough of these that we know what burdens we have to push and what we have to do so we can get there quite quickly. But in the two weeks that have passed, they are not letting us into the business yet.","Craig Hettenbach","Understood. Just other follow-up in terms of kind of being at the bottom here and then you guys have seen some of this first and then been out in front of it. That said are there still any kind of variations by different geographies or end markets or from a bookings perspective at this point is that kind of stable and seasonal?","Steve Sanghi","I don't have any end market commentary but from a geography standpoint it is clearly a distinction, I mean the world knows at this point in time that China is weaker than normal and we're finding that U.S. and Europe to be normal.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Daily [ph] at Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks guys. Steve, just a question on the China weakness, you said you're baking it into the guidance this quarter. When you talk about the 23% EPS growth in fiscal '17 do you think the China weakness last beyond this quarter? And then if you could just share us your insights as to why or why not, that would be great. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","Chris, I'm not going to comment what the industry would do beyond this quarter but whatever our assessment is of that is baked into when they are talking about 23% EPS growth.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, okay. And then Ganesh, you commented on the automotive end market. To the extent you can -- can you just give us your comments on the other -- sort of main end markets, how they have been? How they are looking this quarter perhaps industrial consumer etcetera?","Ganesh Moorthy","It is hard to predict exactly what segments are going to do and how they are going to do in the quarter. Clearly, we can see where the strength is. There is other softness we've seen in some of the China related -- many of China has consumer content that goes with it. Our PC segment is doing reasonably well, even though I know the macro PC has other issues because we play in some of the more value-added segments in the office computing, in the server side, some of the PC peripherals, all of that. And -- so there is nothing that stands out, I think automotive stands out because it's relatively strong compared to others.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We'll go next to William Stein at SunTrust.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my question. First, I'm hoping Steve you can talk a little bit about when you highlight the very strong accretion you expect from Atmel, can you talk a bit about how much you expect to come from revenue synergies and perhaps highlight how front end or back end loaded you anticipate that be?","Steve Sanghi","Well, we did not break the synergies into OpEx growth margin and revenue growth and we're not going to. Some of the work has been done by our knowledge and assessment and experience and applying cycles of learning or the previous acquisitions. As I said earlier, Atmel management hasn't let us into the business to really do a bottoms up on product line by product line, cost by cost, wafer by wafer, ASP by ASP. So the analysis is not done at that level, it's done at a more higher level but our experience shows just look at Micrel, I mean this is the second or third time we have increased the accretion guidance on Micrel, we did the same thing with SMSC. So, we think the numbers we have given you are good but we are not going to break it down further by the three pieces.","William Stein","Understood. Maybe one for Eric, I think you mentioned there was a special income of $5 million in the quarter, did I hear that right? And can you elaborate as to what that is and whether it repeats?","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, so it does not repeat so we had a couple of things happen in the quarter. On the legal front we had a settlements that brought some income in the Microchip and there was a couple of settlements that went out and the net of those were essentially the $5 million.","William Stein","Great, thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Then not in the non-GAAP. Are they in the non-GAAP?","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, they are not in the non-GAAP.","Steve Sanghi","They are not in the non-GAAP; they are only in the GAAP.","William Stein","Understood, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Caso at Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Caso","Thank you. With respect to Atmel and just some of the comments that you had made regarding the amount of business I guess you'd essentially look to keep from that. You talked about, about 95% of the business -- I guess essentially meeting your margins criteria. Should we gather from that that as we go forward those 95% of the business lines you would continue them and eventually the goal would be to get those up to Microchip margin targets. Is that the right interpretation of what you said there?","Steve Sanghi","Well, look at the history of what we have done. The same kind of concerns were raised with SMSC. Did we sell a product line from SMSC? Did we discontinue the PC business? Did we discontinue the other parts of the business? This question is raised every time. When we go in we assess the situation, we look at all the product lines, we see how it maps to our product line, what the margins are, we put higher focus on the product lines which we can grow faster at higher margin, we put less focus on the product lines that have lower margin and we change the model mix, we change the factory strategy, we shutdown factories, we move things around. In every acquisition we have gotten those results.","Two weeks after announcing the acquisition and the one in which basically we got very little insight into the company because of competitive factors compared to any of our acquisitions. Why do you guys always assume that the gross margin improvement has to happen only from discontinuing the product lines, those pieces have been there before and they will always run? We didn't do that in the prior acquisition and yes, we got them into last quarter, the December quarter. Supertex gross margin was 17%, actual data.","Ganesh Moorthy","Chris, if you look at the January 19 presentation that we put up and we announced the transaction I think you will see what our top process was relative to gross margin overtime and expenses overtime as we combined the two companies. And you will see that there is improvement in all areas that we're planning on.","Chris Caso","Right, okay. Just addressing one of the other things you had brought up with Atmel as well, and the leverage. Maybe you could speak to how you have looked at this perhaps under different macro conditions and obviously neither you nor I can predict what the macro does over the next two or three years. But how have you looked at this through a bunch of different market conditions? I know in the past when we've hit downturns, you've been able to ramp back OpEx for Microchip in order to protect EPS. Do you feel the same confidence in the ability to do that on the Microchip with some leverage as you're in the process of paying down at leverage from the deal?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, I think the answer of that is yes. And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean do you really think conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis and seeing in there where the leverage gets to -- is there any threat to the dividend, what happens to the cash flow, what happens to the capital, do you think we really would do that? So, trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis and what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up. Then we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs are self-sustaining but a small amount of capital is sustaining but then the rest of the capital is kind of growth in new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there is a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3 and we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account.","Chris Caso","Alright, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Harsh Kumar at Stephens Investment Banking.","Harsh Kumar","Steve, I wanted to ask you about analog, you talked about it being a bonanza. Could you just tell us about -- I know that the Microchip analog attach rate is very high for its own microcontroller. What is your expectation with Atmel? Do you think you can get a similar level of attach rate with some of their products? Is there anything that Atmel makes that you can leverage through your salesforce? Any color would be great.","Steve Sanghi","Harsh, the answer to that is yes. Where it works is, a customer sits down to lay out the board and when they choose a microcontroller they start to write the code and the analog is fit in later. I need a supervisor, I need an LDO, I think I need an A to D converter, I think I need this and that. So those are things that you can attach it on the microcontroller and many time those selections are made many months later. But when a microcontroller manufacturer like us has its own analog, so one of the advantage we have is we can sample all the things that customer needs in their application, right away. So when the customer is ready, it's handy already, it's available in front of his eyes. And the attach rate to the Atmel's microcontroller would be very similar, that's the first thing we would do to take all of their black diagrams worldwide that exists out to customers and really see whose analog is around.","Harsh Kumar","Got it, very helpful Steve. And then as a follow-up if I can ask you, I've seen you acquire a bunch of companies here in the last seven\/eight years, and most of them have been successful, some underway to that track. When you buy a company Steve, when you look at a new acquisition, what kind of up margin goals do you have for them? We have seen some of the older ones that are done well into the 30s but is there a number or hurdle rate that you can share with us or perhaps even arrange or qualitatively even?","Steve Sanghi","I think Harsh I rather not because that becomes a model for the next acquisition regarding what I could pay.","Harsh Kumar","That's fair, appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Raj Bindra Gill [ph] at Needham & Company.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the IoT strategy going forward now that you've acquired Atmel's assets. And can you talk a little bit about what they bring to the table and what you have with your existing portfolio and how you think you would be able to get -- generate competitive advantage with respect to that market?","Steve Sanghi","As just in the last call, that -- IoT is very hard to define, what you put in IoT and a lot of people put the entire microcontrollers in IoT and if you do that we've been well over a $1 billion of business but very strict definition of IoT would be really not counting the microcontroller but when really the application is really connected on the internet wirelessly through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or whatever. So, I mean our IoT business is approximately twice the size of Atmel's IoT business, I mean somebody could count it differently how you define it but counting apples-to-apples. So it grows that business by 50%. We had all the functionality; we had the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth, the BLE.","So we had all the functionality, from that standpoint we don't really get something new but when you get a scale -- 50% larger scale, and secondly when you get into individual specs and products, people could argue my product is better than, mine is lower power and mine is larger range, and this and that and that and the combination of those we're going to get in some cases way better and in some cases they are better. Together we will cover more of the market with 50% larger scale.","Ganesh Moorthy","And if I can add to that, I think the other part of IoT which is growing is the security of the nodes themselves and Atmel does have awesome good products line that address that. So you put the two together, it's a more powerful combination than what we had individually.","Unidentified Analyst","And as my follow-up, in terms of the consolidation that's occurring in the semiconductor industry, how do you look at your competitors are positioning now with the acquisition of Atmel, say vis-\u00e0-vis NXP\/Freescale who are also going to have a large portfolio of 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller assets. Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","The way we look at it is, we don't look at any of the acquisition that is a must for us. We have not preceded any of the past acquisitions we have done with the eye towards that it's an acquisition that we must do. We have done them because we found them, we were able to get them either at a reasonable price or we're able to build a model where it would make sense but you've seen us walk away from acquisition, like we've walked away from CSL, we walked away from many, many other that did not come in the public domain.","We competed with Freescale when there were multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion to $5 billion revenue company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million then $500 million and then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed being a much smaller company with assets, with TI, with Freescale, and with ST-Micro and others. Scale is important but just scale for the sake of scale with not good products lines and not good execution and all that -- lot of larger companies have terrible business model. Still Atmel to compete with NXP and Freescale we could compete with both of them individually and together ourselves fine. We did Atmel for the reasons we have described earlier.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for that.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Cassidy at Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations Ganesh. What are the strengths that Microchip has had with your microcontrollers if you have a consistent development tool for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit? Do you plan on bringing the Atmel products under that same development tool umbrella, is that possible or will you be running two separate tools?","Ganesh Moorthy","It's early days, Atmel also has a very good development tool environment that they run for their products and as we move forward, we'll look at other ways for Atmel products to work under the Microchip development tools, other way is for Microchip products to work under the Atmel development tools. There is a lot more to be discovered and done and when we get to the stage where we can engage in more detail with them.","Development tools to the engineers are a very touchy subject and it's one that it's important for them to feel comfortable designing with our entire portfolio, we thought they've gotten used to. And I think that our ways to slowly overtime building the ability for each other's products to be fit underneath the development tools that are available. So, more to come on that but I think both companies have strong development tools, Microchip obviously has had them over the entire 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit portfolio and Atmel has one for the AVR products and one for the ARM products. And we'll look for ways to make it so that design engineers find it sticky using our development tools.","Kevin Cassidy","Alright. Okay, great.","Steve Sanghi","Let me add little bit to it. I just kind of get the feeling here that Investor Analysts have made too much of it. For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit was an internal architecture and one of the thing \u2013 reason, part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment and Microchip tool set we want to extend to MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has number of development environments for Power to PC, for ARM architecture, for the 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has them, AVR, they have -- number of other companies have the similar. Silica [ph] have 8051 for 8-bit and then it's ARM for 32-bit, so no other company has it, those companies aren't dead.","Now true if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better but I think Street is looking at like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then therefore it is the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies they have existed with multiple architectures, they can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have a on-development tool that sells products from SMSC, Rob [ph] Networks had it. So we use other architecture, we use 8051, we use ARP, we use ARM but it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it but we have already in the last few years with other smaller acquisitions already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere then that would be promotable challenge to develop it but it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit.","So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself for eight years you guys have hounded us for not having ARM that was a negative. Now we have ARM and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. I wasn't taking that as a negative but what about as we look out there, your automotive business, where are you getting more attraction? Is it with microcontrollers or analog?","Ganesh Moorthy","It's both. Again, as Steve mentioned earlier on, we don't go into a socket trying to win a single product in it. We obviously get in early because the microcontrollers are some of the earlier decisions that people have to make but it's microcontrollers, it's analog, it's memory, it's the clocks. And as we broaden the portfolio it gives us more opportunities to attach in a given application, automotive or otherwise.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for this call. Mr. Sanghi, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Well, I just wanted to say that thanks for attending the call today. And there are number of conferences we'll be going to in the month of February and early March and we'll see you on the road. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","James Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter of fiscal year 2013 financial performance; and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.","Net sales into the December quarter were a record $416 million and were up 2% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $407.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter.","Revenue by product line was $266 million for microcontrollers, $93.3 million for analog, $32.5 million for memory, $21.3 million for licensing and $2.9 million of other.","Revenue by geography was $77.3 million in the Americas, $84 million in Europe and $254.7 million in Asia.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance provided on November 8. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 30.6% of sales and near the low end of our guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income was 25.4% of sales and net income was $84.5 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.41 per diluted share, which is at the high end of our guidance.","On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 48.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by the sell-through of $30.8 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisitions.","Total operating expenses were $183 million or 44% of sales, and include intangible amortization and special charges of $42.3 million and also includes share-based compensation of $12.3 million. The GAAP net income was $10.2 million.","In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.5%, and the GAAP tax expense was impacted by the acquisition-related items and several nonrecurring events. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items.","Our tax rate in the March quarter will be impacted by the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that we expect will provide a benefit of about $5.6 million related to calendar 2012 and results in a non-GAAP tax rate of between 8.5% and 9%.","Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 13% to 15%.","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.32, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.018 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006.","The dividend declared today of $0.353 per share will be paid on March 7, 2013, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $69 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 42nd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 36th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And this program continues to be an important component of how we'll return value to our shareholders.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2013, was $261.6 million or 111 days. I want to walk you through how the inventory days calculation is impacted by the purchase accounting associated with the SMSC acquisition as it can be confusing.","The accounting rules require us to first write up on acquired company's inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date, causing a huge increase in the inventory balance. This effectively values inventory at selling price, less cost to sell.","Secondly, when the inventory is sold, the inventory balance is significantly reduced with the written up inventory costs flowing through cost of goods sold. The written up inventory coming off the balance sheet and pulling through cost of goods sold in the December quarter reduced the days of inventory calculations significantly.","Lastly, in the March quarter, the cost of goods sold will not reflect any significant amount of sell-through of written up inventory and the inventory balances will be clean. So the days of inventory calculation will return to a more normalized level.","We expect days of inventory at the end of March to be in the 123 to 129 day range. So we are making progress in reducing the inventory balances with the action we implemented in our factories in the December quarter.","Inventory at our distributors are at their all-time lowest levels of 27 days. We believe the distribution inventory will increase in the March quarter. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue recognition throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.","At December 31, the consolidated accounts receivable balance was $177.5 million. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. We had strong free cash flow generation in the December quarter of $123.2 million, prior to our dividend payment.","As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.77 billion, and we had $610 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit.","Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the March quarter.","Capital spending was approximately $9.9 million for the December quarter. We expect about $24 million in capital spending in the March quarter, as we prepare for the upturn.","We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be about $60 million. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $23 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines.","Our microcontroller revenue grew 1.8% sequentially in the December quarter to achieve an all-time record of $266 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 22.6% versus the year ago quarter. And as you will hear in Steve's remarks later, we gained market share in all microcontroller segments during 2012.","Microcontrollers represented 63.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 12.6% sequentially in the December quarter, achieving a new record for revenue.","We continue to expand the breadth of 16-bit solutions that we're offering and customers that we are serving, as we continue to gain market share in this segment.","Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 17.4% sequentially in the December quarter. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share.","Now moving to our analog products. Our analog business grew 7.7% sequentially in the December quarter to achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue represented 22.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest proportion of our revenue ever.","During the quarter, we launched 2 new families of analog products. The first is a portfolio of high-efficiency discrete power MOSFETs, specifically tuned for power applications. The second is a family of analog power controllers that offer higher voltages and enable significant energy efficiency improvement in power conversion applications. Both product families expand our served available market for existing customers and applications, as well as enable us to penetrate new customers and applications, and nicely complement our dsPIC digital signal controllers, which already have a leadership position in the power conversion market segment.","Now onto our memory business. This business is comprised of Serial EE memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, and was down 11.2% on a sequential basis.","While this business has had some drive on our growth, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 7.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.","We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","Before I wrap up, a quick update on a couple of elements of the SMSC integration. All SMSC products started shipping from Microchip's operational systems on December 1, 2012, a month ahead of the plan we had last communicated to you. We have begun implementing actions to exploit our packaging and testing infrastructure in Thailand to extract operational synergies. This will, however, be a multi-quarter effort, as we systematically prioritize and execute the plans we have developed. We expect this will result in incremental EPS accretion and will be a component that drives us to our long-term business model.","So to summarize, the SMSC integration is going well and we're on or ahead of our integration plans.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013.","We are pleased with our execution in the December quarter, despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Our net sales, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share were all better than the mid-point of our guidance.","We made new all-time record in net sales for several of our product lines. Microcontrollers, with $266 million of net sales, posted a new record. Our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers each posted a new record in revenue. Analog products also posted a new record. Our licensing businesses also performed very well in the quarter and achieved this 6% sequential growth.","Last, but not the least, the December quarter was our 89th consecutive quarter of profitability. December quarter also had several other highlights.","First, our non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.41 were at the high end of our guidance. Number two, we achieved $0.065 accretion from SMSC, which was well above our guidance of $0.04 to $0.05 for December quarter.  Number 3, during the quarter, we instituted a rotating time-off program for our fab employees and substantially reduced the wafer starts in our factories with reduced inventory. Because of SMSC acquisition and the write-up of SMSC inventory to market value, the inventory calculations are very complex and can be confusing.","In our T.J. Rodgers [ph] of Cypress Semiconductors calls it wacky purchase accounting. I happen to agree. Eric Bjornholt went through a 3-step process on inventory after an acquisition. In step 1, the inventory is written up to the fair market value, so the inventory balloons and the inventory days go up.","In the second step, the written up inventory's sold, so the inventory drops and the cost of goods sold balloon up. So the inventory days drop significantly. In December quarter, you saw this impact of step 2.","In step 3, the inventory returns to normal, as the written up inventory and the higher cost of goods sold are purged from the system. The inventory days go up again because of lower cost of goods sold.","So you will see that in the March quarter, when we expect the inventory days to be about 123 to 129 days.","As I have said before, inventory calculations are complex after immediate acquisition. Please let me worry about the inventory. We're making significant progress in reducing Microchip inventory. Our longer-term goal for inventory continues to be 115 to 120 days.","We also instituted a 5% pay cut for all executives, and then requested other employees of the company to join the executives in a voluntary 5% pay reduction through June 30, 2013.","I'm happy to report that approximately 2,400 employees voluntarily stepped up to take a 5% pay cut. We call it shared sacrifice. This helped in reducing the operating expenses and avoided a broad-based layoff to cut operating expenses. This also allowed us to remain committed to our investments and will help lead to a stronger recovery for Microchip.","I want to thank all the dedicated Microchip employees who volunteered for this pay cut. The participation level exemplifies the strength and uniqueness of Microchip culture.","I would also like to comment on the calendar year 2012 results. I had a chance to compare Microchip's microcontroller results with the Semiconductor Industry Association data for 2012 that was just released last week.","We are pleased that Microchip gained a market share in each of 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and overall microcontrollers. For calendar year 2012, our total microcontroller revenue was $997 million, which was up 3.8% from calendar year '11 revenue of $961 million. We don't break out the individual revenues by bit worth. But overall, microcontroller market share increased from 7.37% in 2011 to 8.25% in 2012. This market share in December quarter was even higher and ended up at 9.34%.","There's no secret about these numbers. Our microcontroller revenue in December quarter was $266 million. And the industry microcontroller revenue, as reported by SIA, was $2.849 billion.","So $266 million divided by $2.849 billion is 9.34%, which was our market share in December quarter. We expect the market share to increase further as we are guiding better than the average of the industry.","Now, I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. We're starting to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite requests in our business, driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline.","The backlog is starting to strengthen for this quarter and the bookings activity into the June quarter is exceptionally high. We believe that December quarter marked the bottom for this cycle for Microchip. A number of our product lines are showing significant momentum and will grow in the March quarter. We have also accounted for the effective Lunar New Year in Asia this quarter, as you have seen in numerous times before, when we are likely to see the effect of an industry recovery a quarter ahead the rest of the industry.","Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the March quarter to be up between 1% to 4% sequentially. We will maintain the rotating time off in our fabrication facilities to continue to reduce inventory. This strategy of rotating time-off worked very well in -- during 2009. It reduces factory output. But at the same time, keeps our staff employed for reduced work hours and give us the flexibility to ramp rapidly when the need arises.","For the time being, we have sufficient inventory at the die inventory level that can provide surge capacity, but we will continue to evaluate the timing of any actions related to our wafer fabs.","We're ramping our back-end facilities in assembly and test to meet the increased demand of our customers. Our back-end facilities have switched from lowering finished goods inventory to now rebuilding finished goods stock to maintain short lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 55.75% to 56.25% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 29.25% to 30.25% of sales. And we expect the operating profit percentage to be between 25.5% to 27% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.49 per share, which includes about a 2.7 cents favorable impact from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","This EPS includes about $0.07 to $0.08 accretion from the acquisition of SMSC, which is up from $0.065 cents in December quarter. For the June 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion from SMSC to increase to about $0.09 to $0.10 per share, which is above the full range of accretion that we had guided on August 2, 2012, at the close of the transaction.","During fiscal '14, we expect the attrition from SMSC to be between $0.38 to $0.42 per share. These numbers remain subject to the health of the underlying economy in general.","So as you can see, we are progressing very well in the integration of SMSC. We are now guiding accretion to be higher than what we had originally guided for fiscal 2014.","We have already made significant progress in transforming SMSC's business model, SMSC's gross margin, operating expenses and operating profits are already significantly better than what SMSC achieved during its full fiscal year prior to the acquisition.","SMSC's operating profit in the December quarter was 21%, well above the 12% operating profit that SMSC reported in fiscal year '12. We expect that significant improvements in SMSC financial metrics will continue.","Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus\/minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%; and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP.","This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and wacky inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis.","We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could give a little more color on some of the business improvement that you've seen. Where are you seeing that as a broad-based? Is it at any particular customers? And then, in particular, I was interested in the comment about the expedites that you were seeing. I don't think that's something we've seen, we've heard from your competitors. Why do you think your customers' expediting? I would assume, given the inventory levels, that the lead times are pretty low right now.","Steve Sanghi","So, Chris, thanks for the question. Basically, the inventories have run down very low at the customers, as well as at the distributors. And the customers were probably accounting for either much deeper cycle in the December or not as much recovery in this current quarter. So we are seeing a fairly strong expedite activity, which is driven by customers not having inventory and them not being able to find that inventory distribution either. The strength is pretty broad-based. We are pretty much seeing it from all geographies, including Europe. And we're seeing it in direct as well as distribution. And it doesn't seem to be any specific market segment, vertical market or anything where it's happening. We have pretty strong bookings across the board.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I guess, with respect to the fab loading. You had earlier talked about running that at lower levels through the June quarter. Is that still the -- is that still the plan? Have some of the improvements you've seen caused you to change that? And perhaps you can just remind us how we should expect as that fab loading increases, we should start to see benefits on the gross margin line.","Steve Sanghi","So that's a very good question, Chris. We're asking the same question to ourselves. At this point in time, we still have inventories higher than what we would like. Total inventories and the majority of the excess inventory is sitting in the die banks. So at this current time, we are ramping our back-ending facilities to move that inventory from die bank to assembly and test into finished goods, to keep the lead time short, meet the expedite request and meet the increasing needs of the customers. We do not feel yet that we need to take any action in the fab because the die banks are quite healthy. Now as those die banks start to correct and overall inventory starts to adjust, we will be watching it on, really, a monthly basis, even more often. And the rotating time-off is very flexible. I mean, it allows us on a moment's notice to be able to increase the wafer starts by simply asking the production staff to work more hours than what they're working today. And that's the beauty of it. We don't have to hire people. We haven't laid off the people. They're all working. They simply are taking some furlough days off and they simply come to work  more hours, which they would love it anyway. So as we start to make those changes, we'll communicate to the investors and analysts. Today, we're not prepared to really make any decision on it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if we can maybe talk about the expedited orders or the increased backlog in maybe a different way. I think you talked about bookings into the June quarter as well. Can you maybe give us some kind of metrics about the longer dated order backlog into the June quarter, either in terms of how many more weeks further extended backlog that you're seeing now that compared to normal or some other kind of metrics indicating coverage?","Ganesh Moorthy","It's a more qualitative assessment we're giving you at this point in time. Clearly, as we look at how far into the quarter are we booked, at this time of the quarter, we can see we are significantly higher booked into this quarter, and we can see backlog starting to fill into the next quarter as well. I don't have a precise number to give you to say how far in that we are for next quarter.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if you could give us any kind of color on the end markets and which ones you expect to be up stronger or maybe less strongly into the March quarter, that will be helpful.","Steve Sanghi","As I earlier mentioned when Chris asked the question, I don't think we are seeing any difference by end markets nor we track them, really, as well as we would like to. Our business is largely horizontal. We serve into a lot of customers and lots of customers through distribution. So we're seeing pretty broad base strength. But some large customers where we do business directly, whether they're in the Consumer segment or Industrial segment or Automotive segment or Computing segment, we're seeing really pretty strong business bookings across the board.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just along the same lines, gross margin, you guided for flat quarter-over-quarter. Can you tell what the dynamics are there? If you said that inventory write-down was a drag on gross margins in the third quarter. Just wondering why it's not going up a little more in the fourth quarter?","James Eric Bjornholt","So, Kevin, I think maybe it's being confused. We didn't talk about an inventory write down. We talked about an inventory write-up associated with purchase accounting. And that only impacts our GAAP gross margins, which you saw were down pretty significantly at about 48%. But that does not impact the non-GAAP results. So that is not something that's impacting the quarter-over-quarter activity. Steve talked about the activities in the wafer fabs. We're remaining with these rotating time-offs schedules at this point in time and really just ramping on the back end. So that's really what's happening on the gross margin line. There isn't anything that is going to improve the gross margins in the March quarter significantly.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And also, how long did the employees agreed to take the 5% cut?","Steve Sanghi","It's through end of June.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is there no other metrics along with that, just through June?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so it's basically voluntary in nature. So 2,400 employees voluntarily stepped up and say, we'll help the company when the operating expenses need to be brought down rather than doing a layoff. We're saving money that way. Therefore, committed to the programs, which will otherwise have to readjust or slip out. Now, if the business environment continues to strengthen, as it is looking, we'll certainly look at it again as we talk to the employees. We could reduce the 5%. We could terminate it early. All those options are there, but the number just became public today. So that conversation hasn't happened with the employees.","Operator","And we will go next to Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. The analog business did exceptionally well in the quarter. So just curious, I know you've been doing well in analog for some time, but was there any specific factor that really helped drive that 8% growth, which was so much better than the rest of the industry?","Steve Sanghi","Gordon, do you want to take that one?","Gordon W. Parnell","Well, analog has been doing very well so much for many quarters, as you say. We have been able to take advantage of our analog business, not only being attached to microcontrollers, but also extending its reach into other areas of analog capability. Certainly, as we've extended into 16 and 32-bit microcontrollers, the opportunity has improved, and we've been able to take advantage of that. Our design win funnel is performing very, very well. And we're very bullish on the capabilities that we have in analog and how we've been able to grow that business.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Steve, maybe just as follow-up on that. If you had to take a stab at, not that we're going to hold you to this, but by how many points do you think analog business can outperform the broader analog business this year? Do you think it's 5 points more or less? Just your thought process given the  design win funnel.","Steve Sanghi","Sure. You will hold me to it so I'm not going to answer it.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well then maybe can I ask you a different question?","Steve Sanghi","Pull me to it, you will be the one.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the bookings, any color you can provide, Steve, on when you started to see the pickup. Was it just in January? Was it November, December? Has the bookings trajectory strengthened only lately? Or was it strengthening through the course of the fourth quarter, because the data is all over the map, depending on which company you talk to this earnings season?","Steve Sanghi","So I think it's been strengthening along. The late part of last quarter was pretty good. But around the Christmas timeframe, lots of people are off and all that. So the data gets very muddy whether you're getting higher amount of bookings in shorter number of days, because purchasing managers wouldn't be working certain days. So we cannot decide for the data as well in that timeframe. But then as we came into January, post the New Year, bookings continue to strengthen and the last several weeks have been just very, very strong.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Paik","This is Andrew Paik calling in for John. I was just curious if you now have a better sense of normal seasonality, including SMSC. And historically, you have been a good indicator of the cycle. So I was curious what your current view is respect to the channel inventory then lead times. It seems like lead times are low, would this lead to a rather muted recovery, in your opinion?","Steve Sanghi","Well, so 2, 3 questions in there. First one was regarding the cyclicality. I don't think we have any better handle on cyclicality, in general. I think if you look at the last several years in semiconductor industry, there's just no cyclicality. I mean it's just like, things are all over the place. And if you take the average of a given quarter for 5 or 6 years, it doesn't really tell you much about where the current quarter could perform. So we could go back to a historic seasonality, where June and September are good, strong quarters. And the March is the reasonable quarter. December is usually very weak. But I'm not sure if that's good right now. March quarter is looking pretty good and December quarter, and -- I'm sorry, June quarter should strengthen further. The second part of your question was what?","Andrew Paik","Just I was curious your current view of the cycle, given that you have been a good indicator in the past. It looks like lead times are pretty low these days. And I was curious if that could possibly lead to a rather muted recovery in the near term?","Steve Sanghi","Well, when the lead times are low, it doesn't lead to a muted recovery, it leads to a strong recovery. Because when the lead times are low, the customers usually have no inventory and slight disturbance or uptick or demand drives what it is driving right now, huge expedite requests, strong bookings. Because when people can find certain parts, lead time shorts doesn't always mean 100% of the products just available today. It's usually on the majority of the products and whenever a customer needs some parts and if they don't find it for a week, the factory's down for the week, and that's very, very expensive. So usually, when the lead times are short, people don't hold any inventory and as soon as there's any sign of recovery, huge kind of orders come in, like we are seeing today. And then the recovery's actually fairly strong, I would say.","Andrew Paik","Okay. And as a quick follow-up. Just given the pay cuts through the June quarter, how should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the, I guess, post -- I guess, through June and then after the June quarter?","Steve Sanghi","So we haven't dollarized for you. I don't know if you have the number. But the March quarter is in our guidance that we're giving you. And then we can further give you guidance for past the June quarter as those pay cuts are reversed. There's also a chance that they reverse early or the pay cut is lessened from 5% or a smaller number, as I mentioned earlier, based on if we see that recovery strengthening in the June quarter, June quarter will be very strong, then we're unlikely to stay through the pay cut to the end of the June. That just wouldn't be fair to the employees at that point in time. So that's something we have to give you guidance as we go along.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steven Eliscu from UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Similar question on the cycle, but I want to ask it somewhat different way. Just based on your experience, strengths you're seeing this quarter. And you're already indicating further strength in the June quarter. Is there any chance that we're getting a restocking cycle that potentially holds from the June quarter, which has historically been seasonally strong? Or do you believe that we're perhaps at the front end of a multi-quarter restocking cycle? What would history tell you?","Steve Sanghi","The history tells me that not all customers, not all purchasing managers telephone each other and line up together to really go do something. And there's always a multicycle. We always see too many moving parts across a large customer base. There are customers pushing out orders, and there are many customers pulling in orders and expediting. So this usually always happens in a multicycle way -- no, multiquarter way, not in one quarter.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then more strategic question. Just we've seen a number of recent announcements from your competitors on low- to mid- range 32-bit controllers that are using 90-nanometer or 65-nanometer technology. And even this one competitor talked, this past week, about 300-millimeter wafer manufacturing. Is there something that -- do you believe there's something that's changed where, now, advanced process technology for low-end 32-bit is now being brought to bear? And potentially with the risk to you that some of that may squeeze your 16-bit price stack? What is your view on how to address that threat?","Ganesh Moorthy","Well, it's nothing new. There have been 32-bits at specific price points that you've been on calls where that had been brought up 4, 5 years ago. This market has many different factors upon which decisions are made. They have platform decisions, there are many competitive expectations beyond price that customers work with. And we can -- as you can see in our results, we have continued to outperform the market on our microcontrollers, on our 16-bit microcontrollers, on our 32-bit microcontrollers. As time goes on, were not standing still. We continue to evolve our product lines. We know what the competitive issues are and where they're coming from. And you will continue to see responses from us to address any competitive threats we see.","Steve Sanghi","But, Steve, how is this question different than the one for the last 15 years where Freescale will do X, Y, Z. and TI has a 300-millimeter fab and Samsung has excess capacity and they will lower the price, and blah, blah, blah, and I just rattled up some names. It's the same thing over and over. Microcontroller market is very complex. It takes thousand-plus MOSFETs from Microchip to really completely serve their market. Somebody wants low-power. Somebody high power. Somebody wants low current. Somebody wants high current. Somebody wants high-performance. Somebody wants low price. It's a very complex market and we know how to serve it very well. I mean, our 8 and 16-bit businesses did very, very well last year. Our 16-bit business was up very substantially year-over-year, and our 8-bit business gained significant share from the market as we compared to the SIA data. So everybody has their strategies. But our strategies are working very well. We gain share by bit worth and overall substantially. And as we go to the conferences, we'll show you some graphs on it. The overall market share growth went from about 7% to a little over 9% going out of the year.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And if I could just ask one last quick question. Last quarter, you guided for SMSC sales of $87 million to $94 million. I realized you're not reporting that going forward. But can you at least tell us what you did relative to that guidance?","Steve Sanghi","We did near the high end of that.","Operator","And we will go next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I'd like to go back to the OpEx questions earlier. Hopefully, you can give us a little bit more detail on the breakdown on the savings that you saw last quarter, probably some of those salary cuts. But I'm wondering what kind of progress you're making in pulling efficiencies through from the SMSC acquisition. And what we might expect going forward. Is this sort of going to be linear improvement? And perhaps in so explaining, you might shed light on why the accretion levels have come up for you guys?","Steve Sanghi","So I think, if you've seen my commentary, we had $0.038 accretion in September quarter. We did $0.065 cents per share in December quarter. We're guiding to $0.07 to $0.08 for March. And what was it? $0.09 to $0.10 for June. So that increasing line of accretion is really a result of systems getting combined and then people becoming redundant, reducing costs, renegotiating stuff based on combined Microchip and SMSC activity, combining offices, closing down leases, those tend to be smaller items. But there is -- across the board, I mean, this is what we did with SST. We're very good at these consolidations. And it's really coming as a result of that. So SST is up -- I'm sorry, SMSC's operating expenses were well in excess of 40% when we started, and it just made 21% operating profit. And we're not breaking out the gross margin. But you can get a feel for. I told you that operating profit number, you can get a feel for how much improvement has been made. The prior year when there were standalone, the operating profits were 12% and on higher revenue. Because it was close to the downturn.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","And how much more can you pull out in terms of efficiencies? Are we near the end of that or in the middle? I guess I'm just trying to think about when those salary increases come back into play, whether it's in the September quarter or earlier?","Steve Sanghi","The salary increases are minute. They don't even make an impact of a penny.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then do we still expect to see more savings from SMSC?","Steve Sanghi","Yes.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","For the OpEx line?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, we do. Because this quarter, we're guiding to $0.07 to $0.08. And then we're seeing $0.09 to $0.10 next quarter and then $0.38 to $0.42 for fiscal year '14. So you could see we're kind of in the middle of it.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, perfect. So that's driven by the savings. And if I could just switch gears for a question on the revenue side. It seems like 16-bit and 32-bit did quite well, 8-bit less well. Can you, perhaps, explain what's going on at 8-bit side of the world? Is it the different composition of end markets perhaps or is 16 or 32 being pulled by technology upgrades? Whereas 8 needs to wait until there's more a broad, general macro recovery?","Steve Sanghi","8-bit is more economically sensitive and it's much larger business for us than 16 and 32. So smaller businesses can outsmart, number one. Number two, there are a lot many newer products on 16 and 32. In any given segment of 16 and 32, there's much larger incremental business coming from new designs where the 8-bit is a much larger business, less number of newer products, less number of newer designs. And so when there's a macroeconomic headwind, you'll have the larger, mature business get more impacted.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","One very quick question. Unfortunately, going back to the OpEx in June. I understand the 5% pay cuts and all the rest. But do you normally see stock comp accrual and the usual annual increases in OpEx bump into June quarter because it's the first fiscal quarter of year? Or do -- will you see it in the December quarter in terms of calendar year?","James Eric Bjornholt","So really, no change in stock comp. So our stock comp program does not -- you don't see spikes in it from that standpoint.","Steve Sanghi","It's a quarterly program.","James Eric Bjornholt","Right. And if I'm kind of a normal payroll standpoint, we make changes as the business can afford them. So it's not consistently tied to a specific quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Steve, just on a high level. The pickup that you've seen, do you believe that this is really economically based? You're gaining share. You've got excessively low inventories in the channel. I guess, can you maybe just talk about what you think is the driver, if not, from an end-market standpoint, just maybe on a high level?","Steve Sanghi","Well, it's really all of the above. You had more of the answer to the question than the question itself. The addition of all those and we cannot decipher. It's the -- there is some recovery in the works. So there's very low inventories. So there is resurgence coming out of that. We're gaining share. Lots of new products, new design wins that have been in the incubation and, usually, customers don't launch their new products in a very bad environment. And I think the last new products are getting launched and we're getting customer schedules for products going into a lot of new products and the structure and bookings coming from there, where customers relaunch their new products. So it's a combination of all that.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, if this was asked before, but I jumped on late. With respect to kind of the trends in the microcontroller market, it appears that some of your competitors are starting to integrate low-power Wi-Fi into the microcontroller and starting to go out to the Internet of things. I'm just wondering if you have thoughts on that particular market or that particular strategy.","Steve Sanghi","Well, the competitor you're mentioning is behind because it -- they're just starting to hear about it now and we've been doing it about, what? Several years?","James Eric Bjornholt","2,4 years. And you can go back and look at as we did acquisitions along the way, we had GE as the first acquisition that brought us into the Internet of thing space between that. The microcontrollers, the software that's required -- and this is a pretty fragmented market, where it takes more than just a product. It takes a significant amount of other collateral to enable small, medium-sized customers to be able to get into this. So we've been at it for some time.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","No, I know you're ahead. I'm just wondering if you -- how do you kind of look at the market in terms of the size and the future of it going forward.","Ganesh Moorthy","Is a good market. It's growing. It's not going to be like a cellphone market. It's going to take time to build across a broad slate of customers and applications. And in that sense, I think it'll be a nice, good sustainable business over the long term.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And just last question on the automotive side. Can you describe some of the cross-selling opportunities that you're kind of seeing now with SMSC and how do you think that kind of positions you to gain share in 32-bit market relative to, say, Freescale or Renesas and just wondering what your thoughts on the ARM-based controller versus kind of MIPS-based controller in that market.","James Eric Bjornholt","Again, we have never thought in terms of ARM versus MIPS and that's really not what the solution that customer buys. So customers are looking for infotainment solutions, which is what came to us through the SMSC acquisitions. Customers are looking for analog and other memory microcontroller kind of solutions to go into the applications they have. The opportunity with SMSC has given us deeper relationships in certain accounts, where they had a much larger position than we did. There's certainly deeper relationships that the SMSC Automotive business had with the automotive OEMs giving us more insight into where platforms are being -- what direction people are taking and what some of the future technology requirements are. I wouldn't say there's any immediate change that has happened in revenue. Things take a long time in automotive. But we're getting substantial insight on where the future of automotive platforms, from an electronics standpoint, are going. And where there are opportunities to potentially work with the combined portfolio of products at customers where either one of us were not having as high of a content.","Steve Sanghi","There is cross-selling synergy coming out on a more shorter-term basis, but it's not in the automotive market because it takes longer. We're seeing it in other industrial and consumer end of the markets, like set-top boxes and various USB hubs and computing segment and docks and speaker docks and all that kind stuff, digital audio and other things. So there are plenty of markets where we are seeing attach opportunities with either microcontrollers or analog products. We're also seeing those opportunities in automotive. But automotive will be longer time to market because they will have to be designed in.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to the presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","We want to thank everyone for attending today. We'll be at the Morgan Stanley conference on February 27 in San Francisco. And we'll see some of you there. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President Business Development and Investor Relations.","I will comment on our third quarter of fiscal year 2012 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results. ","I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share base compensation and acquisition-related expenses.","Net sales in December quarter were $329.2 million and were down sequentially 3.4% from net sales of $340.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter and were down 10.5% from net sales of $367.8 million in the December 2010 quarter. Looking at revenue by geography for the December quarter, Americas were down 3.4% sequentially, Europe was down 15.3% sequentially and Asia was up 1.9% sequentially. All geographies were impacted by the weak economic and industry conditions we experienced, with Asia being the strongest and Europe being the weakest as compared to our expectations. ","Our non-GAAP results were in line with our quarterly guidance provided on November 3, 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.8% in the December quarter, and non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.3% of sales. Operating income was 30.5% of sales, and net income was $85.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share. ","On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization, were 55.8% in the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $95.7 million or 29.1% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $8.6 million, acquisition-related expenses of $1.2 million and $0.7 million of special income associated with acquisitions from prior years. GAAP net income of $77.5 million or $0.38 per diluted share and was favorably impacted by $4.1 million of nonrecurring tax events.","In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.7%, and the GAAP tax rate was 7.4% as a result of the nonrecurring tax events discussed earlier. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing businesses, gains or losses on trading securities and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be about 12.5% to 13%. ","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.043, acquisition-related items were about $0.011, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and the favorable tax event was about $0.02. The dividend declared today of $0.349 per share will be paid on March 6, 2012, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $67.1 million.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at December 31 was $217.9 million or 137 days, up 5 days from the prior-quarter levels. The total combined inventory held either by Microchip or its distributors was down 6 days on a sequential basis. Inventory at our distributors was 35 days, which is down 11 days from the prior-quarter level. The change that we experienced in distribution inventory levels is that largest one quarter change we have ever experienced. ","However, I remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At December 31, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $149.3 million, an increase of 4.8% from the balance as of the end of December. Receivable balances continue to be in great condition with excellent payment performance from our customers. ","As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.77 billion and was down $5.1 million from the prior-quarter levels. The significant reduction in distributor inventory holding levels negatively impacted our cash collections during the quarter. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $80 million to $90 million in the March quarter prior to our dividend payment. ","Capital spending was $6.1 million for the December quarter and is expected to be about $68 million for fiscal 2012. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $21.5 million, which was down $0.5 million from the September quarter. Depreciation expense is projected to be about $21 million in the March quarter and about $86.5 million for fiscal 2012. ","I want to remind investors and analysts that fluctuations in Microchip's share price impact the diluted shares outstanding used in our earnings per share calculations. The average share price of Microchip's stock in the December 2011 quarter was $34.75. Dilution from Microchip's outstanding convertible debentures occurs at average quarterly share prices above $28.21, which is the current conversion price. ","We have updated the schedule on the supplemental financial information section of the Investor Relations page of our website that shows what the incremental share count from the convertible debt will be at various share prices. That should continue to be helpful to investors and analysts when trying to estimate the impact of share count increases on earnings per share. ","Our financial guidance for the March 2012 quarter is based on an average Microchip share price of $38 to calculate the additional dilutive effect from the convertible debt. The negative impact on the earnings per diluted share calculation from the difference in the assumed average stock price for the March 2012 quarter compared to the actual share price in the December 2011 quarter is about $0.005 to $0.006. Inventors and analysts should refer to the table on our website if they want to model the diluted shares outstanding using a different weighted average share price for the quarter. ","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. Let's start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was down 4.4% on a sequential basis, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product lines down sequentially. ","Our 16-bit business was down 5.4% sequentially as we experienced some short-term pushouts from customers in the computing segments who were affected by supply-chain issues stemming from the flooding in Thailand. For the first 9 months of fiscal year '12, our 16-bit business was 11.5% higher than the corresponding period in fiscal year '11, and we're expecting good growth in the March quarter as customer demand rebounds. We continue to retain the designs we had established, and we are securing many new design wins at new and existing customers. ","Our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth, up 33.7% on a sequential basis and up 137.3% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record. For the 9 months of fiscal year '12, our 32-bit business was 134.1% higher than the corresponding period in fiscal year '11, and we're again expecting strong growth in the March quarter. Despite the challenging environment, this product line continues to demonstrate growth as many new designs continue to go into production. ","Our 32-bit results also reflect market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that if we -- is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises, and that the choice of the core itself is not as important. The number of customers in volume production grew to 809, and we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business. ","Over the last 12 to 18 months, we have been investing and accelerating the pace of new microcontroller product introductions, especially in the 16-bit and 32-bit space where our portfolio is not yet as rich as our 8-bit microcontroller portfolio. We expect that in the next 12 months we will bring to market over 150 new 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers as we expand our served available market and accelerate our market share gains over the next cycle. ","Moving to development tools. We shipped over 43,100 development tools in the December quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped over 1.25 million development tools. Development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. Development tools get used by our customers for multiple projects over several years and as such, the continued trend of strong development tool sales bodes well for future growth. ","Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 1.75% sequentially and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. The strength of our analog business is due to 2 factors: one, the introduction of a steady stream of innovative new products that target a broad range of applications; and second, our strategy to focus not only on attaching to our microcontrollers, but also to other microcontrollers as well as other devices like DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs that require analog around them. ","We remain pleased with the design win momentum our analog business has shown. We also have a number of significant new product announcements planned in the next few months, which we expect will drive strong revenue growth in the future. ","Moving to our memory products. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, was down 6.6% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. ","With that, let me now pass it to Steve for his general comments as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the December 2011 quarter and then provide guidance for the March 2012 quarter. ","Our December quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during our last earnings call. The thesis that we had described to the investors 2 quarters ago was that industry was going into a broad-based demand weakness and inventory correction. Our thesis has played out exactly as we have predicted. We explained to the investors and the analysts that we see the effect of industry events first. Microchip went into this correction a quarter before many of the others in the semiconductor industry. Since then, we have seen this sentiment get reflected in results coming from the early -- every semiconductor company to the earnings season. ","Then in the last earnings call, we said that we saw December as the bottoming out quarter for the current cycle for Microchip. We are reconfirming our belief that December was a bottom quarter for this cycle, and we will begin to see a sequential revenue growth starting in the March quarter. ","We went into this cycle one quarter earlier than most, and we will also come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. You have seen that many of the semiconductor companies missed their initial December quarter guidance, have guided down further for March quarter and have called the March quarter their bottom. For Microchip, the December quarter was our bottom, and we will grow in the March quarter. ","Now when you start to compare calendar year 2011 to calendar year 2010, Microchip's results look favorable to the industry's results, particularly if you adjust for the acquisitions made by the other companies. Ganesh has commented on the product lines. I wanted to further highlight 3 product lines. 32-bit microcontrollers, with a 33.7% sequential growth, made a new record and was the star performer. Licensing with a 4.9% sequential growth also made a new record. While analog, with a 1.75% sequential growth, really bucked the trend with the industry down in double digits. ","On the factory side, in our 2 fabs, we took some shut down days around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year. As Eric reported, our total inventory at Microchip plus distributors combined went down by 6 days from its peak in September quarter. We continue to expect that the total inventory position will come down as the recovery further unfolds. ","I will now provide guidance for the March 2012 quarter. Our guidance is based on recovery starting to take place from the inventory correction with December as a bottom quarter. We also have taken into account the effects of the Lunar New Year in Asia in the March quarter. We expect our net sales in the March 2012 quarter to be up 1% to 5% sequentially. As the holiday shutdowns are reversed from the March 2012 quarter, we will expect to see significant recovery in gross margin. ","We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be between 57.75% to 58.25%, which is 125 basis points better than the December quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 25.75% to 26.25% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.75% to 32.25% of sales, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share. ","After 125 basis points improvement in gross margin in the March quarter, we will see further improvement in the subsequent quarters and expect to hit 60% non-GAAP gross margin by the end of fiscal year. On a longer-term basis, with the low amount of new capital continuing to shut off all depreciation, gradual ramp in factories as the inventories burned off and ongoing die shrinks and other cost reductions, we will start to work the gross margin back up towards the corporate target of about 61% on a non-GAAP basis. ","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, sale of noncore businesses, gain and loss in public securities, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. ","Finally, the December quarter was our 85th consecutive profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 56.8% and the non-GAAP operating profit of 30.5% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors even in the best of times. We feel very positive and confident about the long-term prospects in our business and are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth. ","With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Venk Nathamuni for Chris Danely. My first question is how does -- you said you've lowered inventory, combined inventory of both the Microchip and the distributors. But how does inventory now compared to what it was during the 2008, 2009 downturn?","Steve Sanghi","Eric, I think you have some data on that.","J. Eric Bjornholt","Yes. So I mean, inventory went higher in the last downturn. Then when recoveries spiked up, it went down pretty significantly from there. But this is definitely not the high we've seen in inventory. I think we were at 143 or 144 days before and we're at 137 now.","Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as my follow-up, you talked about recovery in orders. Is that in your opinion driven primarily by demand coming back, or is it more of an inventory restocking phenomenon that's going on?","Steve Sanghi","It is always a combination. The downside was both weak demand as well as inventory correction, and the recovery would really have both elements in it.","Operator","We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Realizing it's still very early post the Chinese or Lunar New Year, can you give us any kind of sense of color from your customers in terms of bookings levels after the Chinese New Year holiday versus the ones you were seeing in the rates in January before the holiday?","Steve Sanghi","I think Monday was the first day back from Chinese New Year, so we'll really get the first data point next week after one week is over. Right now, we basically have 2 or 3 days, so I don't really think there's any data yet.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understand. And then on the white goods market, I think some of your peers have talked about somewhat mixed results out of that market in terms of the demand that they're seeing. And I think the retail results over Chinese New Year were also somewhat mixed. Can you talk about that vertical in particular for you?","Steve Sanghi","We can't break it down by vertical. Our customer mix is much, much broader than many other people who tend to sell into large verticals. We have 30,000, 40,000 plus customers in China, so we can't really break it down by vertical. But we do know, after looking at some large customers worldwide, our automotive business was slightly up last quarter, but all the others were down. And even the automotive was driven by really a couple of customers where we had some significant design wins during the tsunami period. But otherwise, there was really a broad-based weakness. As far as China or Asia was concerned, our business was up in Asia.","J. Eric Bjornholt","Yes. Our Far East business is up 1.9% sequentially.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wonder with respect to the gross margin and the gross margin improvement that you're expecting in the March quarter, what does that imply with respect to your own inventory levels and the channel inventory levels as we go forward? Do you plan to keep the inventory flattish from here? Or do you anticipate some replenishment going on going forward?","Steve Sanghi","So I think we don't really know what the distributors will do. We take the revenue only on what the distribution sell-through. So the distribution activity in a given quarter, on a sell-in basis, doesn't really impact our revenue, and we don't really care. Lead times are short. If they want to build inventory, we have the product available. If they don't want to build inventory, so be it. So what's really important is the combination of distributor inventory plus ours. If they hold more, we'll have less; if they hold less, we'll have more. And the combined distribution plus our inventory will do roughly what?","J. Eric Bjornholt","We expect it will be about flat in the March quarter.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And this is a follow-on, a clarification. I thought I heard you say back at the 61% gross margin rate by the end of the fiscal year. Just to confirm that my understanding is right. And if that's the case, what -- as you grow back to the 61% level, is that predicated on a certain revenue run rate level in order to get back to those level -- to that gross margin level?","Steve Sanghi","Yes, of course, it is but we're not going to tell you that. We're not going to tell you the number.","J. Eric Bjornholt","Just for clarification. So Steve's comments were that by the end of fiscal 2013, we would expect to be back at about the 60% non-GAAP gross margin range, and our long-term model of 61% hasn't changed.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So 60% by the end of fiscal '13 non-GAAP and 61% eventually?","J. Eric Bjornholt","That's right.","Steve Sanghi","Because he was trying to triangulate the 61% means what kind of gross margin. Obviously, internally, we have a model, but it also depends on the mix of the product lines and mix of where the demand comes in. So it has lots of moving pieces. It's not going to constrain because various product lines have various different gross margins, but we have a model internally. And yes, it does tie to a revenue number.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the 32-bit results, can you say what applications were you winning the most with your 32-bit processor?","Ganesh Moorthy","What we have said before is we have a broad set of customers. We're at over 800 customers and a broad set of applications. We don't really detect a particular application or segment that is driving the strength. It's pretty broad-based in terms of 32-bit wins as well as our 32-bit revenue growth.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","How about the analog being up quarter-over-quarter far exceeding the market? Are they being tied to the same 32-bit controllers, or is it just a general lift that you're getting in the new product?","Ganesh Moorthy","A combination of both. Certainly, as we have strengthened our 32-bit, it does bring some analog alone. But the analog business is a larger business, and it clearly has strength in a number of areas that we have brought new products over the last 1 to 2 years that have gone to production. So it's also pretty broad-based in how it's driving growth.","Operator","We'll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","The inventory in the channel at 35 days, how does that compare to previous bottoms in the cycle?","J. Eric Bjornholt","So just the inventory over time is really ranged. It's had a broad range. It's been kind of low 30s to about 50 days. But if you look over the last 3 years, this is on the low end of where we've been at 35 days. So I would think that over time, distributors will do some restocking. But I don't know when that's going to happen, if that's going to be in March or quarters further out.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the other question I have, some of your peers have noted a particular weakness out of China in the December quarter and also in the March quarter. I'm just curious what you're seeing in the Chinese market in particular?","Steve Sanghi","I think it's hard to talk about general. Some of the others, depending on what their revenue recognition is, was it the sell-in or the sell-through? And I've spoken about it in the last 2 or 3 conference calls. If the revenue recognition is sell-in, then it's happening what we told you, where the sell-in guys took a huge reduction of distribution inventory as the negative revenue. Microchip's distribution inventory went down significantly, but it doesn't affect our revenue because we are sell-through. That's why we went into this correction first, a quarter earlier than most, and we're coming out it before earlier than most. So our Asia business was up slightly while other people were down double digits because they were recognizing reduction in distribution inventory as the reduction in the revenue.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Understood. And my last question, if I look at the tax rate for fiscal '13, should we consider it staying more or less the 13% level?","J. Eric Bjornholt","Yes. It'll be in the general range that we are in the March quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question relates to a higher level of thinking on the business. It's been a while since you've added to the analog business, and obviously, there's some activity in the M&A market. I was wondering, I don't anticipate you to comment directly on your strategy, but I wanted you to comment on the proportioning of the business. And to what degree would having a little bit of a larger analog business perhaps helps with cross-selling microcontroller or memory?","Steve Sanghi","What activity are you talking about?","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Activity in terms of potential sales of activity. Genon [ph] recently was purchased. There are other activities for proposed sales of companies.","Steve Sanghi","So you're referring to the M&A activity in the market?","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Correct, yes.","Steve Sanghi","So if you lay out a chart of Microchip's analog growth over the last few years, you will see that we'll be nearly on the top of the list of analog company growth. You can compare that to the standalone analog companies which are in the $100 million to $300 million, $400 million, $600 million range, or you can even include the companies which have large analog business as part of the other large companies. So even at our size, we have done very well in introducing very good products, being able to acquire very good analog talent, having a pretty good strategic plan and executing it to really grow market share and do substantially better than the others. As far as the M&A is concerned, we continuously look at opportunities. As you know, in the analog business, we have acquired some companies in the past. If a good opportunity were to become available, we certainly would be interested. But we are not willing to pay the kind of premiums that you have seen in some recent M&A market. That's just not our style.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful. And then the second question I have is in regards to the timing of why Microchip sees either improvement or softness perhaps one quarter earlier than other companies. I know that you talk a lot about your operational excellence and lead times being so low that being a contributing factor. The question that I had is, to what degree does the programmability of your products enable distributors to more rapidly stock and destock your product? To what degree does that have a timing element versus other companies with fixed hardwire solutions that have much longer skew tails?","Steve Sanghi","So I don't think that's a significant factor because the distribution stocking or destocking doesn't affect our revenue. We don't take that as revenue. The biggest effect, and I've seen this earlier, is because we are 100% sell-through around the world and our competitors are sell-in. So that's the largest difference. When the distributor stocks it, it makes the revenue higher. When they destocks it, it makes the other people's revenue lower. Stocking and destocking has no effect on Microchip's business. It only has the effect on the inventory. It has no effect on revenue. Our revenue is driven by demand creation and distributors selling out. Now programmability makes it easier, makes our products more desirable. It has many other positive effects on the market, but being able to see it early is probably not as much one of them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.","Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Steve, you talked about a fiscal gross margin target of 60% and on longer-term, 61%. I'm curious if you could elaborate on what the biggest factors are that would play into that thinking?","Steve Sanghi","So I think some of the factors are obviously the factory utilization. We took a number of shutdown days last quarter because inventory levels were high and the business was weak and the distribution was destocking. So when the distribution was destocking, we were running our factories lower. But longer-term, there are a number of factors playing. So number one, the factories will go to full production as the factories ramp. That has probably the single largest effect on incremental gross margin. We're also continuing to shut off all the depreciation. So in our factories, with our business model, we use the equipment for many, many years after the equipment is fully depreciated. So that has a positive impact on gross margin. We're adding a low amount of new capital. So that, again, there's a less amount of incremental depreciation being added. And there are ongoing die shrinks as we take the products to more advanced technologies and other cost reductions and yields and all that. So those are really the main factors. The other factor is the product mix, but I think that's fairly slow moving, where you could have product lines which have better gross margin than the others. And over long term, you don't really know which one is going to grow more than the other, and they could have minor deviation in overall gross margin, the effect of those product mixes. So I think those are the number of factors which we're driving.","Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it, Steve. And there's a lot of -- there's some fair bit of thinking that because communication and industrial businesses in general, not yours, but the industry as such got hammered last year towards the end, that they would spike back up a little bit better than most. I'm curious if you could, may be not give numbers, but if you could just give us your sense of exposure to those areas, that's comm and industrial?","Steve Sanghi","We don't really have any breakout by segment -- by industry segment. So we don't really break our business internally by how much is industrial, how much is communication. In the kind of products we sell, it's exactly the same Microchip product that could go into industrial application, the same product could go into a commercial application. And same large customers may have divisions that are building industrial products and other divisions that are building commercial thermostats. And so it's impossible for us to track it. Sometimes we buy it as one-line item and use it in both, so therefore, we don't really break our business that way. We don't look at our business that way.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.","Steve Sanghi","Okay. Thanks for attending the call. We are heading to a conference. I think Eric Bjornholt will be at the Stifel conference coming up, and we'll see some of you on the non-deal [ph] road shows that we often go from time to time and there are some planned this quarter. So thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Bjornholt","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the acquisition of Micrel, which was completed today."," We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were 534 million, below the midpoint of our guidance which was $555.5 million and we\u2019re up 0.5% from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the June 2014 quarter.","Revenue by product line in the June quarter was 348.2 million for microcontrollers, a $127.1 million for analog, $31.8 million for memory, $23.3 million for licensing and $3.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was a 104.5 million in the Americas, a 114.7 million in Europe and 314.7 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at 58.3% [technical difficulty]. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.6% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.6% of sales and net income was $148.9 million. This resulted in $0.69 per diluted share, which was at the low end of our guidance, was nonetheless a new record. ","On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 57.9% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of 1.7 million of share-based compensation and 0.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.","Total operating expenses were 187.7 million or 35.2% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of 34.6 million, share-based compensation of [technical difficulty], 2.2 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of 1.6 million. GAAP other expense includes a 13.8 million gain on the sale of the reminder of an investment that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. And a $2.2 million gain on the sale of another investments.","GAAP net income was $130.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $18.7 million, which was primarily driven by the release of defer tax liability due to some IP ownership restructuring that occurred in that quarter, related to our prior acquisition of ISSC. ","In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 9.1%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the 18.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 11% to 12%. ","To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.163, share-based compensation was about $0.049, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.086, a favorable difference on the sale of two investments during the quarter was about $0.074 and the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP non-controlling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.02 and non-cash interest expense was about $0.035.","The dividend declared today of $0.358 per share will be paid on September 25, 2015, to shareholders of record on September 11, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $75.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 52st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 46th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amounts to almost $2.6 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. ","During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back 1.4 billion of our stock. Our combined cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is almost $4 billion. ","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at June 30, 2015, was $303.7 million or 123 days, up by 12 days to the levels at the end of the March quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 37 days and was flat to the March quarter levels. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We have taken actions to moderate our production activities and our foundry wafer purchases in the current quarter to moderate any inventory billed. ","The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding the purchase of the remaining shares of ISSC that were outstanding, our dividend payment, the changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $143.8 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash in total investment position was 2.43 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were 497 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the September quarter.","Capital spending was approximately 33.6 million in the June quarter. We expect about 35 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 have been reduced from our previously guided 160 million to a 125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $24.7 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give this comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy","Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.","Our microcontroller revenue was up 1.3% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We experienced the same broad based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 8% over the prior four rolling quarters. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain for the market share. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip\u2019s overall revenue in the June quarter.","Moving to our analog business, our analog business was down 0.6% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. In this business too we experienced a broad based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate over the last four rolling quarters, our analog business was up 11% over the prior four rolling quarters. Our analog business represented 23.8% of Microchip\u2019s overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.","Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products was down 4.8% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serve [technical difficulty] to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.95% of Microchip\u2019s overall revenue in the June quarter.","Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 7th we have spent considerable time understanding Micrel\u2019s businesses, organization and assistance. We have developed detailed integration plans that we have begun to execute today after the transaction closed. As we described in our May 7th conference call, Micrel has three product line business units and a small foundry services business. Micrel\u2019s linear and power solutions business is a classic highly fragmented analog business. This business together with Microchip\u2019s standard analog business form combined portfolio that will serve a broad base of applications and customers and enable a number of cross selling opportunities.","Micrel\u2019s LAN solutions business consists of a range of Ethernet products including controllers, switches and physical layers for different speeds. This business will strengthen Microchip\u2019s overall Ethernet offering and also enable us to serve a broader set of applications and customers. Micrel\u2019s timing solutions business consist of a comprehensive clock and timing portfolio including frequency control products, clock generation products and clock distribution products. It also includes MEMs technology capability that enables much smaller timing components.","This is a brand new field of play for Microchip that we\u2019re excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip who could be customers for our microcontroller analog and memory products.","In regards to sales and field applications, we are planning to keep Micrel\u2019s sales and applications engineers and we\u2019ll cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies through cross selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution networks of the two companies. Some of the distributors for the two companies are the same while others are different. And our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies.","In regards to manufacturing, Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time.","With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition, as well as the guidance going forward.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 including comments on the integration plan for Micrel.","Our June quarter results were shy of our guidance, but were consistent with what other than the semiconductor industry have reported. The quarter started out well but the negative effects of the very weak economy in China and challenges in Europe led by a very weak Euro caused us to finish the quarter below our guidance in revenue. We were able to keep the non-GAAP gross margin percentage and earnings per share within the guidance albeit on the low end of it.","Gross margin of 58.3% operating expenses of 25.6% and operating profit of 32.6% were all very respectable achievements.","The June quarter was also our 99th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 99th consecutive profitable quarters. I look forward to the current quarter being our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, an achievement unmatched in our industry.","I will\u00a0now provide guidance for the September quarter including Micrel revenue. Our guidance is based on the assumption that Europe will continue to be in the doldrums and is made worse so by the summer holidays, and China, which has been the engine of growth in the past, remaining slow. In preparing our guidance we have done bottoms up analysis region-by-region, distributor-by-distributor and by major customers. We have also included Micrel revenue from today August 3rd to the end of the quarter as we understand it.","We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $532 million to $569 million, includes [technical difficulty] revenue from the sales of Micrel products from today till the end of the quarter. Without counting Micrel, we expect our net sales to be between flat to down 7% sequentially. ","I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be much lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.6% to 57.8% for the combined company negatively impacted by the lower gross margin of Micrel and sequentially flat without Micrel.","We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 27.7% to 28.9% of sales for the combined company and we expect the combined company non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.7% to 30.1% of sales, again, negatively impacted by higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel.","We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.66 per share. The non-GAAP earnings per share impacted by $0.015 dilution coming from the consolidation of Micrel.","Now let me provide you more updates on the Micrel acquisition. We closed the acquisition today and we now begin the hard work of integration to drive shareholder value. The shareholders of Micrel overwhelmingly approved the merger with 98.95% of the Micrel's shares that voted in the favor of the merger.","As part of the transaction, we will pay an aggregate of approximately $430 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 8,626,795 shares. Taking into consideration the equity awards assumed and the cash and investments on Micrel, the balance sheet at the closing date, the total enterprise value is in line with the $744 million that we shared with investors when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement back on May 7, 2015.","Now Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning, I will cover four areas. First, I will explain to you how the revenue of Micrel will be consolidated into Microchip's SEC revenue reporting. Second, I will explain our plans in the IT systems and manufacturing area. Third, I will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition. And finally, I will provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel.","So let us begin with how the revenue of Micrel will be included in the Microchip's revenue reporting. Micrel breaks down its revenue into three reported product lines, linear and power solutions, LAN solutions and TCG, which is timing and communication.","99% of Micrel revenue will be reported as analog revenue within Microchip. Approximately 1% of Micrel revenue is on products that are built on a microcontroller core. They are in fact special purpose microcontrollers and will be reported within our microcontroller revenue. ","Now I will give you update on our integration planning in the IT systems area and in the manufacturing area. In the last three months, we have studied the business systems of both companies. Micrel is a small company and its business systems are relatively old. We have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. We estimate that this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2016. ","Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6 inch fab in San Jose, there is about 30% utilize at the current time. Micrel also uses outside foundries for some of its products, mostly for the LAN solutions group. These happen to be some of the same foundries that Microchip uses for some of our products that are outsourced. We will leave those products running in the outside fabs. Our focus will be to deal with 6 inch San Jose fab that is severely underutilized.","Microchip will transfer all of Micrel's products from its 6 inch fab to other facilities. A majority of these products will transfer to Microchip's two 8 inch fabs, one in Tempe Arizona and second in Gresham, Oregon, some products maybe transfer to other outside foundries, wherever there is a better process technology match. We believe that that this transfer of all the products from Micrel fab to either Microchip fab, or to some foundries will take about one to two years, after that San Jose 6 inch fab will be closed. Regarding, backend manufacturing, Micrel's subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchips but many are same. Where appropriate, we will apply our extended purchasing power to lower our supply chain cost, as in the other acquisitions we will also do a careful make versus buy analysis on each package and product type, over time some of the products and packages maybe broad into our assembly and test facility, while others will remain at the sub-contractors.","Microchip will however combined and manufacturing systems, like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all Micrel products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing system by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2016.","With this let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. We currently expect the Micrel acquisition to be $0.015 to dilutive to a non-GAAP EPS for the partial September quarter. The acquisition just closed today. So we need more time to study and provide you further guidance but with the rate at which we expect the integration to progress. Our initial estimate will be that Micrel acquisition will be breakeven to our December quarter non-GAAP EPS.","For longer term, after we have closed the San Jose fab, which is about one to two years from now, we expect Micrel to add about $0.25 off accretion to Microchips yearly non-GAAP EPS. These numbers are preliminary and depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.","Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record have shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisition and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged, If thereafter San Jose fab is closed and the older 6 inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates through first call. ","With this operator, will you please call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. ","Craig Hettenbach","Thanks. Starting first with just that industry question, Steve, if I look at the current environment today, what\u2019s your sense the biggest difference between today versus last fall, when there was also at that time, I'll albeit a brief correction.","Stephen Sanghi","Craig, I was hoping that, this question could wait some time at least later, that's a first question. So, let's take it. As the earning season has progressed a number of investors and analyst have commented and have asked me, how I thought about the current environment in the semiconductor and if this is something that Saturday in October of last year, with our earnings warning at that time, I have not engaged into any conversation within any of the investors and analyst, because we were in the quite time. Then I thought, if the question was asked, shall I address it here, so here it is, it's really the first question.","And while it\u2019s really painful to visit that period again, we do believe that the first signs of its slowdown in China, were visible at that time. We saw that through thousands of small customers, who were experiencing the economic headwinds and not buying enough products. This was further, enhanced by a very tight credit environment that was prevalent at that time in China, then after a warning, the December quarters numbers for most semiconductor companies were cut by an average of about 5%. The company is in the supply chain of one mobile customer where a notable exception. Now then came the March quarter, which was seasonally weak for most companies due to Chinese New Year and also some others blamed it on Euro weakness, which was indeed a new phenomenon. ","Then came in the June quarter which is traditionally a very strong quarter in China and we saw a broad based miss from the industry led by China and the September quarter guidance has been very weak also driven by China.","Now we have semiconductor companies admitting that there was indeed inventory build in China and in the distribution that needs to correct. We knew from the companies that we have acquired and others that we conducted diligence on but did not acquired that there was a broad based selling driven inventory build in distribution channel which the prevailing rate of demand could not support. You can only play a selling gain for so long and this time it can truly went a bit longer. But now everyone\u2019s numbers have been cut significantly, a large number of companies are now selling well below the stock prices on October 9th prior to our call, when I said I quote \u201cwe believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future.","But it probably took a quarter longer than it has taken historically, likely mached by the smartphone supply chain with everyone having some exposure to it. But really in answer to investor and analyst question, I see yes this is pretty much a continuation of the phenomena that we saw last October.","Craig Hettenbach","Just a quick follow up to that before have an additional question. Just the comment on China remained slow, how would you kind of frame just the environment in China? Do you think we\u2019re through most of the inventory correction and it will attract demand or any additional quotes in China for Q3?","Ganesh Moorthy","We\u2019re not through all the inventory corrections, no. There will again be differences in sell in versus sell through also, all of our revenue is sell through. But we bought Micrel today which had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through with most of China being sell-in which will be converting to sell-through only recognizing sell-through, so there are number of moving parts in our business. But industry still has a lot of inventory in China.","Craig Hettenbach","And then just a follow up on Micrel, appreciate the thoughts in terms of how you expect to transform the business, particularly in manufacturing. On the product side given that you had a little bit of time in talking to customers, any anecdotes of feedback in terms of their product portfolio and how you see that kind of best fit within Microchip?","Ganesh Moorthy","We have decided to take linear and power solutions business which was the largest division inside of Micrel and completely fold that within Microchip which is happening starting today. So essentially we have taken our analog business and internally in Microchip\u2019s split it into two portions, one is called the analog power and interface division and second is called the mix signal and linear division, both about equal size and then the entire Micrel linear and power business is folding into one of those division which is the analog power management business.","So, we will apply our principles, our metrics of R&D and all that. When I look at R&D as a percentage of sales for analog, Microchip is one of the most efficient in the industry, we don\u2019t breakout into visual R&D, but the amount of R&D we spend to get the margins and revenue and all there and Micrel is one of the worst when you look at the numbers. So we have to move this from worst to best. And we have done that with others, we\u2019ve done that with SSC and SMSC and Supertex and over and over and over, we have team there, that\u2019s what we have to do here.","Then there is LAN business here which is about $50 million, $60 million and that also we\u2019re going to completely fold that into Microchip\u2019s USB and Networking Division where our LAN business resides, that again will then really benefit from our methodologies, our metrics, our management and everything else. And the third business here is the timing business, which is a new business for us and we will keep that as a business unit but if you\u2019re reporting to one of our seasoned general manager so he can also get the mentorship and really move towards our model.","Operator","We\u2019ve move next to William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Steve based on the tenure [ph] of what now you\u2019re describing as three or four quarter downturn. And the order of linearity that you are seeing maybe in the calendar second quarter and into July and now August, I am wondering if you can provide any view as to when you think demand normalizes?","Steve Sanghi","I think, I resigned from the forecasting business last year, you might recall that in November. I am not going to make that comment looking forward for the industry. If we just look at ourselves, we think we gave you September quarter guidance already, December [technical difficulty] is seasonally a weak quarter for Microchip and really also for the industry. Considering this correction happening in June and September, what would manifest for December, it's kind of hard to see right now. But as we go through the quarter, one could make a guess that December quarter should not seasonally be weak because ordinarily December quarter is followed by a very strong June and September. This time it is not. But I am not making that prediction today. I got to see the quarter. I got to see the bookings, the backlog, everything else and talk about it later maybe as we go on the road.","The biggest leverage here short-term is really improving Micrel's business and I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us to do that, and largest leverage comes from the fab. There is 30% utilization in the fab and we dramatically lower its cost by transferring product and the first five products will be running out of Microchip's fab in about six weeks.","William Stein","That's great. Steve, I appreciate that. Maybe I can use that as sort of the next question. So after completing this deal and understanding that all the synergies and all the work is still in front of you, I wondering if you can characterize the current appetite for a future M&A,? It certainly helps dull the pain from the current demand environment a little bit. And I am wondering how much appetite there is for more of that though? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi","Well, we have substantial line in place, which we did that earlier in February. And we have constantly -- a good of number of companies in our funnel that we are constantly talking to, dating with, analyzing and there's no guarantee, these things are not schedulable at any given point in time, and sometime it takes longer for a deal to materialize, other time it's shorter. But yes, we still have appetite for the next acquisition, no question about it.","Operator","We'll move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. ","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Steve, Ganesh and Eric, I was wondering if get a little more detail about kind of the actions you are taking around utilization rates in your own fabs, I am kind of curious, do you think September will represent the trough, I guess Steve given your comments about uncertainty around December, but possibly a scenario where December is a little bit better than normal seasonal weak. Does that mean that, that most of the utilization action is behind you or how should I think about that? And Eric remind me again how that flows through the gross margin?","Steve Sanghi","Well, let me comment on the utilization. First of all, the Gresham factory in Oregon is a newer factory and in a newer factory we need a -- once in a five years we need a major shutdown to repair things that can't be repaired while the factory is running. And that shut down has been previously scheduled for a year for this October and that shutdown usually is about seven to eight days you have to shut the factory and we reserve for it going into that shutdown, and it's planned shutdown, we have to do it every once in a five years. We are currently planning to tack on a few more days to it to bring the inventory down because the factory will be shut down anyway and rather than starting and staffing it will be best to extend that a little bit.","Then the factory in Tempe is a much older facility and doesn\u2019t have as many redundancies built into it and the Tempe facility [technical difficulty] we always do that in December, over the holidays. So this time again we will have a shutdown in Tempe facility over the holidays and we are planning to tack on a few more days to that to correct our inventory. So you will see our internal inventory rise in the September quarter, but then it corrects because we got shutdowns in both factories in the December quarter. ","The normal shutdown, we accrue it over four quarters, balance over the year but the extra shutdown days we're going to do will charge it to the current quarter. Basically in the quarter it happens which will be the calendar Q4. So Q4 gross margin would be impacted, I don\u2019t know whether Eric is able to dollarize it at this point in time and whether it will GAAP or non-GAAP that would be a one-time phenomenon.","Eric Bjornholt","Yes, and I think Steve you've answered John's question and I don\u2019t -- at this point in time we're not willing to give guidance for December quarter gross margin. So I will leave it at that.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful guys. Maybe as my follow up for Steve and Ganesh. Steven and Ganesh, we tend to like to sometimes compare apples-to-oranges here on Wall Street. We look at your microcontroller business and often time compare that don\u2019t have sort of 8 bit part of the business and might be a relatively new entrant. And I guess I am trying to think about kind of your relative growth rate of microcontrollers versus your peers. Is the right way for us to think about this as given your breadth in 8 bit perhaps you are more cyclical in these parts of the cycle? And if that's the case, maybe Ganesh you can give us some metrics around 16 bits and 31 bits that make you guys comfortable that you are at least maintaining if not gaining share in those segments in the market?","Steve Sanghi","So we don\u2019t breakout 16 bit and 32 bit as you may recall from about two to three quarters ago but we did present in April, where the market share results were and we had significant growth in market-share in each of 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit. So we look at the market as a continuum off solutions that I needed in many cases an 8 bit is good enough, in some cases it's a 16 bit and in another cases it's 32 bit. And we see growth opportunities in all three of them both in terms of the applications and the markets that they can go into. So our view is that that is growth that is taking place and then there is growth yet to be had in all three segments we\u2019re not looking at 8 bit to save us or 32 bit to save us or 16 bit to save us all three of them we expect will grow.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll take Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Caso","The question is -- like first question is on Micrel and you talk about $0.25 of accretion over one or two years, could you give us some help in determining how much of that perhaps we might see a bit earlier and how much of that would have to wait? Your comment said that much of this I guess the majority of this comes in the fab closer and I assume that is sometime we have to wait for little bit or perhaps there is some near-term accretion as you start to control some of the OpEx?","Ganesh Moorthy ","So there is near-term accretion, I don\u2019t know if I have a breakdown considering we\u2019re closing the acquisition just today before that all we had model and then we have quickly verified some stuff. But if you give us little more time maybe as we get on the road and see you at some conferences or the next conference call or we can have much more intelligent numbers for you. But there is accretion coming from expense reduction and other thing that prior to that it's not all from fab.","Chris Caso","And just with -- just kind of a follow-up on the market conditions as well and I am sure you heard from some others there was -- I guess there have been some different commentary regarding the pace of bookings through the quarter kind of how things have started in the quarter in the month of July, wondering if you can give some clarity on that, plus linearity from the June quarter, how July has gotten started and if that\u2019s giving you some incremental optimism or pessimism as you look forward?","Ganesh Moorthy ","I listened to some of the calls and it's amazing how the customer\u2019s been placing bookings are kind of behaving almost same for everybody and I could say the same team that, this quarter\u2019s bookings look better than it was last quarter and there was some strength in the overall numbers. But that\u2019s baked into the guidance and I think if you look at various people\u2019s commentary last quarter, April was good and May was good and then June fell off. So I think people make these adjustments through the quarter and better a July doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better end of September for us or anybody else because customers can correct that anytime in the quarter. Sometime people place bookings earlier, so whatever product they need for the quarter they have commitment from the supplier that they will get the product for their needs and then easy for them to cancel or slip it out, that I don\u2019t needed in September, give it to me in October then to have a situation where they don\u2019t place the order and September quarter comes and needs something and somebody\u2019s lead time is more than four weeks and they can\u2019t get it.","So customer seem to have very little penalty for getting their queue in line, almost no penalty. So therefore, it's not unusual for the first quarter sometime to see stronger bookings only to get corrected later on. And I would not reach so much into it for anybody.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Going back to the Micrel fab and shutting that down, you gave data point that five products have moved. Can you say, what is the determination between getting it closed in one-year to two years? Is it customer qualifications or finding other fabs that can manufacturer?","Steve Sanghi ","So that\u2019s a good question. So we bought Supertex on April 1, 2014 and we closed the Supertex fab in April of 2015 took us about 13 months and that fab was much smaller than Micrel fab is, Micrel fab is larger, it's a larger company than Supertex. But we learned a lot doing Supertex and we were able to do that in 13 months. So we\u2019re mounting a much larger team and we\u2019re going to transfer the products at more than twice the rate than actually we transferred the products from Supertex fab into and the basic difference between whether it's a year or two years is, sub-types [ph] of customers, the products from the new fab, products coming out of fab and working first time and you have retreat it, running into any kind of equipment issues, equipments and fabs seem to be different, we believe we can emulate Micrel\u2019s process on our equipment and we are successful in the first couple of processes we are attempting so far. But at any point in time you could run into a challenge and have to then convert a Micrel piece of equipment from 6 inch to 8 inch or buy a new one and have three, four, five months delay in getting that equipment. So there are lot of unknowns, lot of unknowns, that\u2019s why we gave this band of a year to two year. My desire is 11 months, but I don\u2019t get everything I desire, I think it's going to be somewhere between one to two years.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, maybe just, maybe some unknown also but is there a chance that there would be some products you can't manufacture somewhere else and they would be discontinued and maybe not get the full revenue Micrel had?","Steve Sanghi","Well, no, so what we do is, there always -- especially in analog there lots of products that needs one fab run every two years. And those products don\u2019t make sense to even having mask set, and put the cost of transferring it. So usually on those mask set we build strategic inventory of four years so. So if the product needs a one run a year then you run four runs out of the Micrel fab before you shut it down, now you have four years customer demand, then you've four years to figure it out what are you going to do with it? I build it into our fab or take it to a subcontractor, transfer the equipment, do whatever. So that's what we will do. That's not going to hold up the fab.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay.","Steve Sanghi","And Micrel is a small company as a percentage of Microchips. So even though there will be a strategic transition inventory build on the products we are transferring in and on the products we are not transferring. The products we are transferring here to build some strategic inventory on those too because you got to give the customer time to qualify 8 inch material while they have 6 inch material available, so you will see that strategic inventory build on our balance sheet. But it's not going to be that large compared to the size of the company and it's strategic in nature.","Operator","We will move next to Gil Alexander with Darfield Associates. ","Gilbert Alexander","Hi. Thank you. My question has been answered.","Steve Sanghi","Thank you Gil.","Operator","Thank you. We will take Chris Danley with Citi.","Chris Danley","Hey. Thanks guys. I guess just one quick clarification on what you are seeing in terms of your guidance. So I think as the other Chris said some of the competitors are saying that business is getting better. So are you, implicate in your guidance, are you assuming that your business is going to get a little worse or just kind of remain at this level throughout the quarter?","Steve Sanghi","I don\u2019t know if I can decipher anymore, Chris. I mean our business in September quarter based on guidance is worse than last quarter and so is everybody else's. So far the guidance I have seen, their guidance for September is worse than what they accomplished in June. So they've got a little bit spurt in bookings, I saw the spurt in bookings, also in July, my [indiscernible] customers trying to lockup their place in line for September, not any different by -- for us versus anybody else. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything more than that.","Chris Danley","Okay. Great. And then my follow up just a couple of things on, Micrel. Is there any way you could quantify the benefit from shutting down their fab and then in the December quarter what sort of revenue should we assume from Micrel because I believe you guys will be incorporating two quarters -- excuse me two months of it in this quarter. Anything you could talk about in terms of your planned OpEx reductions for Micrel in the December as well?","Steve Sanghi","I think it\u2019s supposed to give that considering the deal closed two hours ago, so probably just be a little more patient. I think I could even do a better job two weeks from now, but not today. We are cutting expenses. We are letting number of people go as we are merging these divisions there is some high level senior leadership that we do not need. So we're making those changes and we got to dollarize it. We are unable to give you December quarter Micrel guidance, Micrel revenue has been falling for four years and recently has fallen a little harder. And we need to understand that. We need to meet with the distributors. We need to see what Microchip's sales force can do. So I don\u2019t quite trust the guidance that I am hearing from them. So therefore I am not able to give December guidance on it yet.","Chris Danley","So can tell us if it was in the June quarter, the revenues for Micrel?","Steve Sanghi","Well I think the June quarter really wasn\u2019t announced because the acquisition closed and I am not sure I am in a position to say that.","Chris Danley","Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thanks.","Operator","We'll move next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Steve I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate further on the China weakness. Specifically, which segments or which verticals are you seeing the weakness in, I know there's been -- when you talked about China being weak back in October, you had mentioned the industrial vertical, wondering if that has spread to other verticals within China and any color there would be helpful?","Steve Sanghi","I think China is weak across the board exactly what it was in October, I don\u2019t remember Microchip has been having industrial and I said we believe that another industry correction has begun. This correction will be seen broadly across the industry in the near future and the verbiage led by China, so I\u2019m not sure whether it could be more industrial, but not only industrial. It\u2019s really not that much different than it was back then. China is weak across the Board.","Rajvindra Gill","And if you could talk about the competitive landscape in the microcontroller market, you have obviously a big pending merger that will be closing in Q4. That merger the combine entity will become one of the largest microcontroller suppliers in the world both from the 8 bit and 32 bit side and a huge player in the automotive market. So I want to get a sense from you how you\u2019re viewing the competitive landscape going forward given these changes in the market share and M&A that\u2019s occurring?","Steve Sanghi","I think if you scan our history of 25 years we began with nothing and competing with some of the largest microcontroller manufacturers in U.S., Europe, Asia and Japan. When we were $100 million microcontroller business we competed with people who had billion, Freescale and NXP and Renesas and others. So I am not sure scale is necessarily a total advantage. We have won that through our disciplined approach to developing products, to running a very responsible P&L, having a high margin business.","We go to market totally different than other people do other people try to seek very large chunks of business that very-very large OEMs which are offering at lower margin and not sticky and our model is at a 100,000 customers, no single customer is larger than 1.5% of our business. So, it\u2019s not necessary that our business is always in the same places. And Renesas hasn\u2019t been able to stop us in years, Freescale hasn\u2019t been able to stop us and they were 100 times larger and them merging with NXP doesn\u2019t really change in IoT for us. I don\u2019t go -- the data deal closes I don\u2019t go to work any different than I did the day before.","Rajvindra Gill","And just last question on IoT. Wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that market in terms of your competitive position and assembling the building blocks to address the market. And any color in terms of how the intensity of the activity of IoT at your customer base, is that really picking up or is it going to take some time to take off? Thanks.","Steve Sanghi","Everybody say that and people don\u2019t kind of wake up a numbers nor do we and everybody is putting different stuff into IoT, so it\u2019s kind of very hard to compare it\u2019s wild west. But all make the claim that we have the strongest IoT franchise. You need intelligent microcontrollers, you need RF building blocks, you need Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Light, RF, Zigbi. We have all of them.","You need various ecosystems with software and stacks and middleware and all that. We have all that. And we have significant number of cloud partners where you have to ping off to often connect with equipment or whatever. We have the strongest building blocks of anybody. We\u2019re seeing companies that will take all of their microcontroller business combine it with sensors of something and petition that as an IoT business while you could do that. But if a PC is connected to a printer and then microcontroller in that chain, it\u2019s not really IoT.","But it\u2019s connected and you can call it IoT, and so I think we gave you a little summary last quarter remember.","Eric Bjornholt","I think we said our IoT business was about $275 million annualized growing at a 35% compounded annual growth rate and really to more narrowly define it to be where there is both smart and connected application.","Rajvindra Gill","So this is a microcontroller attached with some sort of connectivity to it, is that how you\u2019re going to [Multiple Speakers].","Steve Sanghi","[Multiple Speakers] IoT, so it\u2019s really where you truly making an RF connection using it as a Wi-Fi or a Bluetooth or a Zigbi --.","Eric Bjornholt","Or could be Ethernet to it if it\u2019s wired, so its microcontrollers, it\u2019s analog, its memory and its connectivity, all those solutions put together with the software frame work that Steve talked about with security built into it and an ecosystem of third parties that allow the connection to the cloud. So it is an important market, it is one in which we have -- historically had significantly strength because all the companies before you can connect have to have something that is smart. And if you want something that is smart microcontrollers and analog are at the heart of building smart devices.","Operator","That does conclude our question-answer-session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any final or additional comments.","Steve Sanghi","Well, thank you very much, we are going to couple of conferences this year and next conference would be?","Eric Bjornholt","We\u2019ll be at the Jefferies 101 conference in Chicago in late August and then the Citi conference in New York in I think September 8th or 9th.","Steve Sanghi","And by that time we may have more understanding of Micrel may be able to tell you more. So I'd love to see you at one of those conferences. Thank you.","Operator","And everyone that does conclude our conference call for today.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important Risk Factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.","In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.","I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.","I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share-based compensation and our acquisition activity. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $902.7 million, near the high end of our guidance and up 2.4% sequentially from net sales of $881.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.","On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.24% for the March quarter and significantly above the mid-point of our guidance, which was 58.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 23.66% of sales, significantly below the mid-point of our guidance range of 24.5%. And non-GAAP operating income was an outstanding 35.6%, well above the mid-point of our guidance of 33.7%, and very close to reaching our prior long-term operating model goal of 36%, which we had just established this past quarter.","Non-GAAP net income was a record $276.9 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.16, which was $0.10 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.06, up 12.6% on a sequential basis and up 64.7% as compared to the same quarter last year.","For fiscal 2017, on a non-GAAP basis net sales were a record $3.502 billion and up 58.2% year-over-year. Gross margins were 57.6%, operating expenses were 25.9% of sales and operating income was 31.6% of sales. Net income was $937.1 million and non-GAAP EPS was a record $3.99 per diluted share.","On a GAAP basis, net sales in the March 2017 quarter were $902.7 million, GAAP gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 59% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.2 million of share-based compensation and a benefit of $1.4 million from a settlement with a vendor associated with a fab excursion in a previous year.","Total operating expenses were $378.7 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $94.3 million, share-based compensation of $18.8 million, $6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $46.1 million, consisting primarily of charges associated with our acquisition integration activities, including a $33 million charge associated with the lease facility in San Jose which we inherited in the Atmel acquisition. We have vacated the San Jose lease building and are finding the environment for subleasing the facility to be quite challenging.","With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $136.9 million or $0.57 per diluted share. For fiscal year 2017, GAAP net sales were a record $3.408 billion, gross margins were 51.6%, operating expenses were 43.5% of sales and operating income was 8.1% of sales. Net income from continuing operations was $170.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter and 8.5% for fiscal year 2017. The GAAP tax rate was negative 91% in the March quarter and negative 90% for fiscal year 2017. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. And the large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences and the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2017 was $417.2 million. Microchip had 103 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, down one day from that of the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 33 days and up two days from the December quarter. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $322.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.41 billion, of which about $500 million is domestic cash.","Due to our February 2017 refinancing activities, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit at the end of March. As part of the refinancing activities, we exchanged some of the 2.125% 2037 bonds issued in 2007 for newly issued 2.25% 2037 bonds. There is still $143.75 million of the 2.125% bonds outstanding, for which there is a call date in December 2017. Our current intention is to call any of these bonds that remain outstanding at the call date, and we have classified these bonds as short term on our balance sheet.","We continue to make good progress on our leverage, with our net debt to EBITDA ending the March quarter at 1.94; this is down from 2.47 at the end of the December quarter. I remind you that last year when we announced the acquisition of Atmel, we had projected our net debt to EBITDA to be about 3 at the end of the March 2017 quarter, wo we have made tremendous improvements in our business over the past year to get where we are today. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 1.65 by the end of June. Our net debt to EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt, as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20-year maturity date.","Capital spending was approximately $23 million in the March quarter. For fiscal year 2017, capital expenditures were $75.3 million, and well below our last communicated guidance of $90 million. We expect about $60 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $170 million. The capital expenditures in the June quarter are high due to rollover of some capital from fiscal 2017 that wasn't received until after year end, due to equipment lead time stretching out.","We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margins improvements to the business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factory. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.6 million.","I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with how our strategic product lines performed in the March quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue produce differential growth results.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller products performed strongly in the March quarter, with revenue being up 4.4% sequentially as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process.","We continue to experience broad-based growth in our business, as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines met or exceeded our expectations for the March quarter. Microcontrollers at over $2.3 billion in annualized revenue represented 64.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our overall 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller portfolio in the broad-based market.","Clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel heritage continue to gain confidence in Microchip's commitment to these products. As a result, we are seeing more designs that were in the pipeline which are going into production and ramping in volume, as well as continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.","Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2016. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number-one position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again gained market share in calendar 2016. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we continue to gain market share as we were the fastest-growing franchise among the top players and we remained in the number-five position. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we gained significant market share again and climbed from the eleventh to the sixth position. For microcontrollers overall, we climbed from the fourth position to the third position and continued our relentless march towards the number-one spot.","As the Gartner results demonstrate, we gained significant market share in calendar 2016 and we continue to gain market share in the first quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our March quarter result. And I believe we have the product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.","Now moving to our analog products. Our analog product revenue was up 1% sequentially in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and also set a new record in the process. At close to $925 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.","We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production.","We, in the meanwhile, continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products as we march relentlessly here, too, towards making analog a $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.","Moving to memory products. Our memory product revenue was sequentially down 2.3% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.","One last note as we consider our calendar year 2016 performance. Last month Semicast ranked Microchip as the eight-largest automotive semiconductor company, a significant move up from the mid-teens ranking we were at in 2015. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance. And as you will hear in Steve's remarks, these end markets have grown as a share of our overall revenue.","Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017 and total fiscal year 2017. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2018.","Our March quarter financial results were very strong. Our non-GAAP net sales were a record and near the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded well beyond the high end of our guidance.","In non-GAAP earnings per share, we blew the top off, with a record earnings per share and up $0.10 above the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 64.7% from the March quarter of a year ago, due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business, as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from various acquisitions worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 106th consecutive profitable quarter.","As I reflect on fiscal year 2017, we had outstanding financial results in every quarter. And closing out the fiscal year with record sales and earnings per share was a befitting tribute to the fiscal year in which we repeatedly hit the ball out of the ballpark.","Now let me decipher the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal fourth quarter. We achieved a new all-time high gross margin and operating margin percentage in our core Microchip business, excluding Atmel, substantially exceeding any prior records. On Atmel, the gross margin improved by another 235 basis points sequentially and Atmel's operating margin achieved another all-time record, exceeding 30% for the very first time.","We achieved an accretion from Atmel in the March quarter of $0.25 per share versus our guidance of $0.18 to $0.22 per share. The total accretion from Atmel for fiscal year 2017 was $0.69; this was compared to $0.25 accretion as our first estimate after we announced the acquisition and without any stock buyback.","By any measure, our March quarter and fiscal year 2017 results are stellar. We're also proud to have achieved 35.6% operating margin for the combined company, which is a stone's throw away from our long-term operating margin target of 36% that we just revised upward last quarter. I want to again thank the worldwide employees of Microchip, including acquired employees of all of our acquisitions, for delivering a stellar and record fiscal year 2017.","Now, investors and analysts have frequently asked us about our revenue breakdown by end market. We have not broken those numbers out in more than a decade, as we do not manage our business by end market. Our standard products sell in multiple vertical markets and have a broad appeal across these various markets. We occasionally see end market breakdown mentioned in some analyst reports. Our end market breakdown, though, has changed substantially in the last decade from our various acquisitions, as well as organic growth in several markets, especially industrial and automotive. Therefore, we have done a comprehensive analysis to prepare and update the end market revenue breakdown of our business for our investors and analysts.","Based on fiscal year 2017 results, our largest market is industrial, with 35% of our business in this market. The second-largest market is automotive, with 25% of our business. Then comes consumer, with 24% of our business, computing with 9%, communication with 5% and, finally defense and aerospace, with 2% of our business. Over the last several years, our fastest-growing markets have been industrial and automotive, which together account for 60% of our business now.","Additionally, our consumer exposure of 24% is not made up of mobile phone; it is made up of home appliances, security systems, thermostats, televisions, remote controls, power tools, drones, joysticks, headphones, furniture, consumer toys, et cetera. With a broad product line and large customer base, compiling our end market breakdown is quite time consuming. We are providing the color for investors to better understand the current complexion of our business by end markets. We do expect to provide this breakdown regularly, but will do so when there is a meaningful change to share.","Now, before I go into the guidance for June quarter, let me say a few words about the environment.","We are seeing a very strong business environment for our products worldwide. Our bookings rate is extremely strong. As you know, we have not broken out our book-to-bill ratio in a long time, since it is largely misunderstood. However, to make you aware of the strength of our bookings, we are providing this indicator for one time.","Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was approximately 1.10. Again, I caution you that bookings are aged out, so a 1.1 book-to-bill ratio does not mean 10% sequential revenue growth. We also take revenue based on sales out from distributors and book-to-bill ratio only measures bookings for sales into distributors. Therefore, the book-to-bill ratio does not represent or help you predict the growth in this quarter, but does give you a sense for the strength of the business environment for our products that we're managing through.","Other inventories at Microchip as well as at our distributors are towards the low-end of the normal range, therefore we are starting to see some lengthening of our lead times. We're starting to see challenges in fab, foundry, probe, assembly and test capacity. We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. Despite all this, we are seeing significant business that we're not able to support by the customer requested dates. These challenges are more acute with our Atmel-originated products, due to the inadequate capacity plan that we inherited. We are adding capacity to alleviate these challenges as quickly as practical.","We also posted a letter on our website on April 4, 2017 informing our customers regarding many of these points. Some of you have questioned our motives posting these letters in the past, suggesting that somehow we were trying to pull ahead backlog. Our bookings were very strong before we posted the letter, and the rate of bookings has not changed after we posted the letter. We believe that our 115,000-plus customers has the right to know about the challenges we face in the current business environment and to prepare for it accordingly. Posting it on the web is the best way to disseminate this information.","Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect total net sales to be up between 2% and 7% sequentially. I want to remind investors that in the past five years, we had two acquisitions that closed in the first week of April. Supertex closed on April 1, 2014 and Atmel closed on April 4, 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking average of last five years of sequential growth for the June quarter would give you a large error. Without acquisitions, our average of last five years of sequential growth in the fiscal first quarter was 3%. Therefore, our revenue guidance is substantially above seasonal. We're also not seeing any issues with our automotive business as some others in the industry have commented. We believe that the comments about subsidies in China on electric cars and other automotive comments were more company-specific. Our automotive business has very strong backlog and continues to grow well.","Regarding gross margin, as more and more savings from our fab consolidation and cost improvement efforts show up and Atmel gross margins continue to improve due to pricing as well as cost reductions, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 59.5% and 60% of sales, we expect overall operating expenses to be between 23% and 23.5% of sales and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 36% and 37% of sales and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27 per share.","I would like to remind investors that last quarter we conservatively revised our long-term financial model upwards to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 60%, operating expense of 24% and operating profit of 36%. We are now already guiding the June quarter to be at or above this long-term operating profit target, therefore we are revising our long-term operating margin target upwards again.","First, let me give you some background. We are seeing an enormous gross margin operating expense and operating profit leverage in our business. We are ramping all of our three fabrication facilities. The increasing utilization lowers the wafer cost. We're also ramping all three of our back-end plants. Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind that of Microchip's in terms of higher amount of parallel testing to achieve higher units per day out of a test system. In many cases, Microchip's units per day per system is 5x to 10x higher than that of Atmel.","We are converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's test technology that is substantially lowering the cost and improving the output. This continues for the next two years or so. The combined effect of lower wafer cost, more efficient assembly and test technology and stable to increasing prices is that we expect our long-term business model to exceed any prior expectations. Therefore, we are setting our new long-term gross margin target to be 62.5% of sales, we are setting our new long-term operating expense target to be 22.5% of sales and we are setting our new long-term operating profit target to be 40% of sales.","Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call.","With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","In order to accommodate as many callers as we can, we ask that you ask one question and one follow-up, you may then reenter the queue and we'll take as many questions as time permits. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the questions and congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Steve, can you help me understand a little bit relative to you increasing CapEx, increasing wafer starts, when do you think you'll be able to catch up with the demand curve here in the near term?","And I guess you said in the press release that there's a considerable amount of demand that you can't meet right now. Any way that you can help us quantify what you're leaving on the table in the near term?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So in terms of CapEx, the majority of CapEx that we're adding is in the back end. As I mentioned, Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind. And we're converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's assembly test technology. The challenge with that is that the easiest way to add quickly incremental capacity is to buy up more of what they have, more of what we have in Atmel, same test systems, same capacity.","But that is very, very inefficient. And if we buy more of that, we get stuck with it for five to seven years in a high-cost structure. So we're trying to buy more efficient capacity, Microchip type, which then requires the writing the test programs, converting them to Microchip's test technology, correlating and doing all that, which takes a little longer. So it's a very fine juggling exercise to reasonably able to satisfy the customers and not have lines down and yet keep a steady march towards converting those products to a very low-cost technology, which is giving gross margin improvements and all that.","So driven by all that, there is significant constraint. We are unable to dollarize the constraint for you today because it changes every day. We don't know where we will end up at the end of the quarter. We know the number where we ended up last quarter, but I think we're less comfortable in sharing it.","I did want to say one other thing, John. After our last earnings call, I saw in your report where you said we see Microchip entering uncharted levels of operational efficiencies and leverage, which should support long-term operating margin of 40%. You were right on.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I get lucky every once in a while.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","You're were, well, either good or lucky. Probably good. It seems that you were right on. You saw something that we saw too, but we were not ready to commit yet and not ready to guide to a 40% operating margin target yet. And we are now and we have guided as such.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, see, maybe that's good lead into my second question. Clearly the scale you've amassed is giving you leverage on the operating line. I'm curious as to what benefits you might be able to see on the top line from your scale, just given that the markets you've played in have been pretty diverse.","I guess are we seeing a trend where customers want to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more, and do you think that that's a long-term sort of advantage for you to perhaps gain share at a faster clip than you historically have?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I think I would say, in our commentary, we have been very careful to not describe the market environment to be anything other than for our products. If you re-listen to what I said, I used it twice, the market environment for our products. We didn't really make any commentary on general market environment. You could talk to everybody else. That's kind of your job to figure out the general market environment. We described it for our products.","So baked in in that environment is also tremendous leverage that we are getting attaching the vast portfolio of our analog products, memory products, to Wi-Fi products, to Bluetooth and others, along with various microcontroller and other products we have. Now, we have sort of 19 different product lines within Microchip today and we're getting enormous leverage in what you call attach in the past, and we have given it a new term at Microchip; we call it Total System Solutions.","So, if you look at the number of devices per board that we had, let's say, five years ago, it's dramatically increasing in terms of number of devices we have per customer board today. I can't give you the number. But that is accelerating and, therefore, somewhat we're creating our own environment. There is a tremendous organic growth we have seen in our business in the last year. And if you just recall a year ago, there were organic growth concerns.","And at the same time, we have added some acquisitions. So if you just look at the March quarter, we beat the earnings by $0.10. $0.05 came from higher Atmel accretion and other $0.05 came from core Microchip. So it's not one or the other. We are really just accelerating on both fronts.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys. And congratulations.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Steve, with John's successful run at 40 percentile, I'll promise not to raise the bar to 45% op margins. But if we can talk about just that attach rate as a follow-up, particularly for wireless connectivity, what you're seeing for MCU with wireless attach and the momentum in that market.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We have many, many embedded systems adding connectivity to them. Certainly, wireless is a big component of that, but we also have wired connectivity in many systems. And our portfolio of connectivity is extremely rich at this point between successive acquisitions that have added to our portfolio.","So embedded systems in general are becoming more valuable when they're attached. We're finding lots of opportunities for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, a number of other proprietary standards, to help these systems connect to whatever is appropriate in their environment. And it is a part of the growth that we're experiencing.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as my follow-up, can you talk about 32-bit, and I know you guys have the MIPS as well as the Atmel ARM core and I know there is more focus on the peripherals than the core. But just wanted to get a sense now that you're a year into Atmel, just some of the design win and product momentum that you're seeing in the marketplace for 32-bit ARM?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So we don't think of it as 32-bit ARM alone. We look at overall 32-bit business. The 32-bit product line has been growing faster than Microchip average growth that we've had. We have fully incorporated the products that came to us from Atmel, what we call the SAM products, and the products historical for Microchip, the PIC32, into our integrated roadmaps as we present it out into our customer base when we pursue new designs. And they're doing very well. And we see strengths in the portfolio that we inherited from Atmel that have taken us to new areas, not only in microcontrollers. We've also got microprocessors that were part of the portfolio.","And then we have some strengths from classic microchip that continue on their efforts. And the forward-going portfolio has a single roadmap. We've brought that all together. And we're very, very confident in the 32-bit product line and its growth under the Microchip cloud (35:30).","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Ganesh.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward, especially now that you've done better than you had anticipated on the leverage levels coming down. How should we think about the company's interest in engaging an additional M&A? And what are your thoughts around doing share repurchases?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So, I think it's quite simple. There are three uses of capital. There can be three different uses: using it in our own business in making investments, giving it as a dividend or using it as M&A, and you can call it maybe, fourth, stock buyback. We're getting extreme leverage on the operating expense side in our business. And it does not seem like we will have a need to go outside of our P&L model to make really a lot of OpEx or any kind of investments.","In terms of CapEx, even the number we guided for the year is really a small portion of the overall yearly revenue, even though the Q1 is high, a little bit front-end loaded, largely because of slip of capital from last quarter.","In terms of dividend, our dividend strategy does not change. The board is committed to continue with the dividend we have and a very, very small minuscule increase every quarter. There is no desire to really do anything different.","And as far as stock buyback is concerned, we do not regularly buy back stock. We've only bought it at extreme occasions. Last time we bought stock was when we had to issue some stock in the Micrel acquisition and we wanted it to be a cash transaction, so we bought the stock back.","So that really leaves M&A. Atmel acquisition now was about a year ago. It's largely consolidated. But as I mentioned, a lot of the back-end and other challenges still remain. We're still trying to convert their test technology, assembly technology, to ours, which will take some time. So if a reasonable acquisition falls in our plate, we're willing to execute it. But the valuations are fairly high right now and there is really nothing imminent that we have on our plate.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question I was just hoping you could help us understand what steps we should think about in terms of bridging from the company's margin levels today toward the targets. You talk a lot about the changes to Atmel's back-end operations and some potential additional leverage as you go forward. Are those the two things that get the company to its target margin ranges? Or are there other things that we should have in mind that the company would execute on to get to those levels?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, it's a little broader than that. We are seeing tremendous gains in reduction in wafer process essentially (38:51), both by increasing loadings in all of our three fabs as well as being able to cross-pollinate and use ours as well as Atmel technology for each of those products, whichever the best solution may be. They were good in certain things; we were good in certain things. Certain products will be cheaper here; certain products will be cheaper there. So we're getting a significant leverage out of fabs.","And then, as you mentioned, we're getting significant leverage out of assembly and test technology. And overall we're getting a lot of operating expense leverage, a lot of other manufacturing leverage also out of the same footprint in our facilities and all that just pumping a tremendous amount of output.","Recall that Atmel did no assembly themselves; they were zero percent assembly and they only did 10% of the tests themselves. Microchip, on the other hand, did nearly 90% of our tests ourselves and we did about 70% of our assembly ourselves. So two companies combined together now, both assembly and test percentages done in-house have dramatically gone down because of Atmel. And as we bring those things from subcontractors to inside and in the process also increase the utilization and increase the output by 5x to 10x per system per day, the results are tremendous. They're just beyond what we could have expected and beyond the leverage that we could reasonably describe.","And I must say that this detail level of due diligence was not available to us. Very poor due diligence was shared. It's because we were ahead on competitors and all that. So a lot of this area we have really done it on our own clock, identify the areas where we could bring significant cost reduction. And we are basically in the process of implementing the first high-volume products on microcontrollers and memories and a few other products are already flowing out of our manufacturing facility. So this is not a pipe dream. We have delivered the front-end of that already.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I would add pricing discipline as the other element that we're proud of (41:20) over the last year to help improve the overall gross margins.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Maybe one other thing to add is that there's still benefits from the shutdown of the Micrel fab that aren't seeing recognized in the P&L we've today. So still a lot of things we're working on together. The things that Steve is talking about Atmel, that's a couple year project. So we've got a lot of headroom and things to work on over the coming quarters.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. First question is just on the lead time extensions. I know you have several different products with several different lead times. But if you could, is there any way to quantify the amount of the lead time extensions? And then, Steve, when was the last time you saw this type of lead time extensions? And then do you think you'll be able to catch up the demand over the summer. Or do you think they can get worse?","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It's not getting worse. Unlike what some of the people on the Street think, the letter has not accelerated the bookings in any way. It didn't accelerate the bookings last time. It didn't accelerate the bookings this time. The letter was posted on April 4, and we received these tremendous bookings in the March quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. And it did not change afterward.","Our customers are fairly trained on they expect that \u2013 we written this letter about 10 times probably in the last 20 years or so. It's results were less than optimal one time a couple of years ago, which, soon after that, the China market fell apart. And, as a result, we had a miss. And many times, the Street just remembers what happened last time.","So these letters have been very effective in informing our large 115,000-plus customers regarding what is happening and then working with them to understand the requirements, being able to build the product in a better mix to understand people's drop-dead requirements so people don't go lines down.","So I can't give you one number across the range of our products, 100,000-plus SKUs. People kind of like to look at one number what the lead time is, and there's no such number. On a given product, lead time could be eight weeks today, and you get one large order and the lead time goes to 12 weeks because the parts which were after the eight weeks are now booked. On the other hand, there are plenty of products available on the shelf. So the lead time can be anywhere from in-stock to 16 weeks, I would say. All over the place.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","And we're working hard to try to get the delinquencies all down by the September quarter timeframe. It all depends on what happens in terms of the bookings on a continuing basis. But that's what all the firepower in the company is aimed towards.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. You mean, Steve, just going to sit in the office and call 115,000 customers and tell them that the lead times are extending?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","That's what the letter's for.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So my next question is just some clarifications on the margins. In terms of the new targets, is that like half from Atmel and half from the legacy Microchip? And then just in terms of the all this accretion and upside you've seen on Atmel's operating margins, can you break out how much is COGS versus your operating expenditures?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, Atmel's both gross and operating margins still remain well behind Microchip's. And as I mentioned, Atmel's operating margin, we got it over 30% and gross margin was up another 235 points. Despite those numbers, they're still substantially behind Microchip's. And we've always said, based on the large amount of mix they've taken before, we never expect that to make 40% operating margin, which really means core goes above and Atmel is below and we bracket an average to about 40%.","So the improvement will really come from both. As we are ramping our fabs, it's lowering wafer cost and helping both gross margin. As we are bringing Atmel's assembly test technology to Microchip's level, the help of that transition to our technology is helping Atmel gross margin, but it's bringing much more output into our factories from outside, which then is also increasing core gross margins.","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Spreading the overhead over a larger base.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Spreading the overhead over a larger base, allowing us to buy more volume of lead frames to packages to molding compounds to everything else in a larger supply with better economics and all that.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congrats as well. I'd like to ask about the characterization of this cycle, Steve, as you've done in the past. Clearly, we're heading into a time of a bit of tightness, a bit of this imbalance between supply and demand. How much of what you're seeing is more related to lack of capacity in the Atmel product versus accelerating demand? And do you anticipate we'll continue to see improving year-over-year growth beyond the June timeframe, which is I think the sort of consensus view at least among sell-side analysts?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Again, I will refrain from making any general remarks about the industry and largely focusing on how I see the business environment for our products. A significant impact of what we are seeing is really driven by the success of our own products in the market and the total (47:51) that I earlier talked about. Number one, there was a significant reluctance on the part of the customers during the year that Atmel was up for sale, regarding what would happen to those products, what would be supported and would not be supported. And if you, as a customer, have a concern, then you kind of always have a back-up plan in case those products were not to be available.","When it became clear that Microchip would buy Atmel, customers were more even disheartened originally thinking that Microchip being a staunch competitor may discontinue AVR and ARM-based products and others. What we did was just the opposite.","And as Ganesh mentioned in his commentary, the result of all that has been a tremendous amount of customer confidence that we have gained in our strategy, in what we are doing. And we're getting unfair share of the design wins and customers' ear. and then analog and Wi-Fi and memory and other attach to boot. So a large portion is really driven by that. There are always small numbers that can really drive a significant change.","Beyond that, we're also seeing general strength in the economy, especially happened post-election in U.S. The whole world seems to be positive. You can talk to distributors and they are seeing strong bookings and a strong environment. Lead time for equipment is lengthening, lead time for packages, all sorts of things is lengthening. So those are some of the signs of what's happening generally in the economy. But I think what we are seeing has really also a significant company-specific element on the top of that.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I can. Eric, I think more your area of expertise. I think there is a FASB pronouncement that's going to require you to transition to a sell-in rev rec. Can you confirm that that's correct and, if so, the timing and anticipated impact on your reported financials?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Yeah, so that change will be effective for Microchip April 1, 2018, so the beginning of our next fiscal year. We are going through the planning process associated with that. I guess what should be important from an investor standpoint is we are not going to change in any way our go-to-market strategy with our distributors, the way that we price our products, the way that we interact with them.","But the reporting will have to be on a sell-in basis, where essentially you're making an estimation of what the net sales price of the product that you're shipping in is going to be. So our accounting team is working through that and will be effective for us next year.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. And congrats again.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congratulations on the solid results execution and the outlook. As we think about growth and as it relates to Atmel's design win pipeline, I know you guys recently refreshed Atmel's AVR 8-bit product line. I think you guys even embedded some of your own IP into this particular product line. I know you guys do a good job of keeping track of design win rates. So, wondering if you've seen a step-up in design wins or feedback from customers for the new AVR 8-bit products?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","It just depends on what timeframe you compare against. So, we have been at it for a year since we bought the company. And the funnel size is enormous. We're seeing substantial growth and the total funnel size on Microchip across 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, Wi-Fi, our networking business, our automotive business, infotainment, MOST business, that the funnel size across Microchip is just enormous. I think we are incredibly and beautifully set up to really deliver what we are telling you.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the analog side, you guys are basically within striking distance of $1 billion in annualized sales. I think last I asked this question, about 50% of these products are tied to your MCU programs and the other 50% is sold kind of standalone on their own performance merits. Is that still the right mix? Or are you getting more attraction on a standalone basis? And then maybe any updates on your analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, we don't really look at the analog business to be either attaching to our microcontrollers or standalone. We want to succeed in both. If we had a very high attach rate but never won anything standalone, that, to us, would be negative because that really means we can only win when it's our microcontroller. That's not the case.","Even if we don't win the microcontroller, and it's a microcontroller from Freescale, Renesas, NXP, or anybody, or maybe the socket doesn't have a microcontroller, it is driven off a microprocessor or a FPGA or some sort of SoC, we still want to be able to win analog in those sockets, rather it's a \u2013 for power management or convertors or have some Wi-Fi on it or have some supervisory op amps or some other things.","So right now I think as we look across, we have victory in every area. We are winning around our microcontroller, we're winning around Atmel's microcontroller and we're winning around other people's microcontrollers, SoC, FPGA, processors, et cetera, and there is no specific focus to be one way or the other. We actually have identified a built-in large opportunity to attach analog around Atmel's microcontrollers because those were the sockets we were purposely kept out. Any of the reference designs that Atmel produced before, by design they would put anybody else in it but Microchip. In the last one year, all those reference designs, tools, development tools, et cetera, they've all been refurbished to replace anybody's analog and Wi-Fi with Microchip's. So there you have incremental additive analog that we should be able to attach. And we are.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the insight, Steve.","Operator","For our next question, we'll go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Rajvindra. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. You broke out the revenue breakdown by end market. You had about 25% in the automotive end market and you mentioned that this was around the eighth largest semi supplier. Do you have any visibility towards what areas of automotive you're seeing your products go into, if there's strength in infotainment versus ADAS or power management? Or any granularity there would be great. Thank you.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","We are in a broad range of applications, but we have some specific ones we have a larger exposure to \u2013 so you mentioned infotainment. But I'd broaden that to networking inside the car as one area. We are in many access control applications in the car. We are in touch control for a range of both touch screen and touch buttons and things. We're in many USB connectivity inside the car. We're in all the garage door openers inside the car. So it's a pretty broad set of applications and with some specific areas in which we have a much higher penetration than even normal.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think we have 51 chips in a Mercedes S-Class car, 55 in a Hyundai Genesis. It's everywhere, up and down the car. So, it's much more broader than anybody can describe.","Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in terms of I guess products going from the high end S-class to Hyundai Genesis and going more mid-market, are you seeing that be a trend that's taking off now or still a quarter or so out?","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, those trends don't happen in a quarter. If you look at the keyless entry, where you don't need the mechanical key anymore, began nearly 20 years ago from General Motor (sic) [General Motors] cars. I think we put the first keyless entry where you don't have to use a mechanical key to open the car.","We did the first hotel room door lock years ago. Before that, there used to be mechanical keys that even opened the hotel room door lock. And as you have seen over the years, people don't even know there's a mechanical key exists for hotel rooms or cars and stuff like that. So these changes are a lot slower, happen over time. These are not one quarter phenomena.","There are 400 different car models that have the HomeLink on it, all-exclusive product of Microchip. There are many hundreds of models that have our MOST bus. There are a large number of models that have our touch in it, and so on and so forth. They all start at the high level and, every year in the following model year, the company will take it down to the middle-range models. And a few years from now, it could get to the lower-end models. Feature-by-feature they migrate down, but the trend doesn't change as much quarter-to-quarter.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I think the way to think about it is we have a high presence in all car segments; it's not just at the high end that we are present. That was just an example to show you in a rich environment of electronics, we have a pretty high percentage. But if you look at the lower-end cars, we have just as high a percentage in many of those cars.","Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, guys. This is Liz Pate in for Chris Rolland. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a quick one on the pricing environment. Maybe you can talk about how that is currently industry-wide, and specifically on the Atmel products. Do you still have some ability to raise prices on those products? And thanks.","Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So we've been talking about it for multiple quarters. It's taken us time to implement the price changes across a broad range of customers. Some of them have been phased-in over time so that they don't all come together in one quarter. But I would say, at this point in time, a substantial portion of the price increases that we've began last June or so are in place. And as we go in \u2013 going forward, it's really no programmed increases in prices.","What we have done is also put in a significant discipline on new designs, because what we were doing with the price increases was correcting past issues where pricing was done poorly. And those new designs are all being done using a more disciplined process to make sure that we don't have to come back and change the pricing out in time.","But pricing for our market tends to be something that it happens at the point of a design-in, and so that's when the competition for what the best performance price-value equation is. And then that happens a year or two before designs usually go into production and there isn't as much pricing discussion that takes place once the designs have been completed and production is getting started.","Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","I want to add, though, that to extend what Ganesh said, that as all the new quotes we are making, really in the last year, have all substantially better disciplined pricing than the average pricing we are having on Atmel parts today, as these designs are going to production, it has been about a year now. So designs are starting to go to production on those things that we quoted on our clock. There will be a steady stream of wind on the back where every quarter the mix gets richer and richer with higher and higher percentage of pricing to be better disciplined pricing coming from Microchip and smaller and smaller percentage of older devices on which we raised the price, but we couldn't raise it all the way to where the new prices are. So this would be a long-term tailwind that will continue to blow in the back.","Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Perfect. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go now to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on your execution. The first question is a gross margin question maybe most appropriate for Eric. I believe the company was expecting to see the benefit of the Micrel San Jose fab shutdown in the first part of the calendar quarter. Is that in fact happening? And, if so, is it more in the calendar first quarter, calendar second quarter or more evenly distributed?","J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.","So I would say the benefits from the Micrel shutdown have been coming over time. We still probably have a couple of quarters to go as we sell through all the older inventory and all the 8-inch inventory starts to be realized in the cost of sales. So we have got benefits from that the last two quarters, but expect that to continue on in the June and September quarters also.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Eric. And then the follow-up question is for Steve. And, Steve, it goes back to a comment that I think you made a few calls ago, when you indicated that, if industry were to grow, I think the number was high-single digits or 10%, I don't recall specifically, that that would favor vertically integrated manufacturers.","So my question is this. With demand strong, with the global economy showing signs of improvement and with what appears to have been a five-year period of fairly disappointing analog CapEx, are you seeing signs in your business where the environment is favoring a vertically integrated manufacturer, like Microchip? And, if not, do you think that will occur later this year, or is that something that would be further into the future? Thank you.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, I think it is happening already. You are seeing it on our results and you will see it in our results in the coming quarters also. If Atmel was a standalone company today, they wouldn't be able to take advantage of these tremendous improvements we're making on assembly test technology inside capacity being able to bring large volumes on our test technology already running in our Thailand facility producing 5x higher output per system.","Subcontractors have no incentive to give you that kind of output. They get paid by the hour on the test system. So if you dramatically improve output and output goes up 5x and now you only have to pay them for 20% of the hours, they're not happy. So there the incentives are not aligned properly. You're seeing tremendous benefit of our vertical manufacturing, both from fab, probe, assembly and tests already and you will continue to see it as we go forward.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any final remarks.","Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.","Well, thank you, everybody. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter and an outstanding fiscal year. And watch us grow, hopefully we can deliver another one. And we'll see some of you at the conferences we will go to later this quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
