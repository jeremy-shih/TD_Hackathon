At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Kristine. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Our speakers for today will be Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling & Projects.","Our cautionary statement is shown on page 2 of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refer to estimates or plans. And of course, actual results could differ due to the factors that are described on this slide as well as in our periodic SEC filings. We'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today, and that's for purposes of facilitating comparisons across periods and with our peers. Reconciliations to non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and again also on our website.","During this morning's Q&A, we're going to try to limit questions to one and that's so we can get to all of our callers. If you have additional questions, obviously, please feel free to jump back into the queue.","And now I'm going to turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning. I'll start on slide 4. We've gotten off to a good start this year by demonstrating another quarter of strong execution. Starting on the left side of the chart with strategy, we again delivered on all our strategic priorities. We increased the quarterly dividend by 7.5%. We paid down $2.7 billion of debt, bringing our total debt to $17 billion at the end of the first quarter.","As you know, at our AIM Meeting in November, we set out a target to reduce debt to $15 billion before the end of 2019. Given the improved outlook for the business and our current cash balances, we intend to accelerate our debt reduction by additional $3 billion this year, thus achieving our leverage target a year early. This is consistent with our priorities, and we believe it sends another strong signal about our commitment to discipline.","With respect to buybacks, we repurchased $500 million of shares this quarter, and we're on track for a total buyback of $2 billion in 2018. This is another return of capital to shareholders that was increased during the quarter, this time by 33% from the target announced in November. Since our buyback program began in late 2016, we've repurchased about 75 million shares or 6% of our share count at an average price of about $48 a share.","One of our stated priorities is to return 20% to 30% of operating cash flow to shareholders. This quarter, we again exceeded that, returning 34% of CFO to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So, strategically, we continue to hit on all priorities. We're maintaining our discipline and following our game plan.","Moving to our financial performance in the middle column. Adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion for the quarter or $0.96 a share. We generated $2.5 billion of cash from operations, excluding working capital, and that exceeded our capital spending by $1 billion. Free cash flow more than funded the dividend and share repurchases for the quarter. Finally, we ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash on hand.","Moving to our operational results on the right. We've also had a strong start to the year. Production for the quarter, excluding Libya, was over 1.2 million BOE a day. Adjusting for dispositions, our underlying production grew 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, and was up 26% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We announced the acquisitions of unconventional acreage in the Louisiana Austin Chalk Play and the liquids-rich Montney as well as the bolt-on acquisition of Anadarko's position in the western North Slope of Alaska. We also completed an active and successful exploration program in Alaska.","So to recap, this quarter's performance again reinforces our commitment to keeping our discipline while delivering our plan. If you turned to slide 5, I'll walk through the first quarter financial results. With WTI averaging about $63 a barrel and Henry Hub about $3 in MMBTU, our average realized price was around $50 a BOE.","As you can see in the bar graph on the left, compared to the prior quarter, adjusted earnings improved almost $600 million due to higher commodity prices, lower depreciation expense and reduced operating costs. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted earnings improved by over $1.3 billion, driven by a 40% improvement in realizations and about a 30% reduction in depreciation expense. The table on the bottom right shows a comparison of year-over-year adjusted earnings by segment for the first quarter.","I would draw your attention to the Lower 48 where only two years ago we had an earnings breakeven above $70 a barrel. We're seeing the earnings power of our unconventional engine driving the bottom line results, with our Lower 48 earnings breakeven now at less than $45 a barrel.","If you turn to slide 6, I'll put the significant improvement in our earnings and cash flow expansion into perspective. The chart on the left illustrates the product mix shift in our portfolio since the first quarter of 2017. Through strategic dispositions and targeted investments in high-margin production, we've increased our exposure to higher-value products such as crude oil and international gas, including LNG. At the same time, we've significantly reduced our exposure to lower-value products such as Canadian and U.S. natural gas and bitumen.","The chart on the right shows that our improved earnings and cash flow are not driven by price increases alone. Here, we show the improvement in realizations compared to the first quarter of 2017 from about $36 to $50 a BOE. The green boxes indicate how much of that realization gain came from product mix improvements and how much came from price increases. Over 40% came from mix improvement. Our product slate is now capturing over 75% of the Brent price, a further indication of how leveraged we are to rising Brent prices.","If you turn to slide 7, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash sources and uses during the quarter. First, looking at the sources of cash shown in green, the combination of cash from operations and dispositions was $2.7 billion. In red, we used $2.9 billion to retire debt, and we spent $1.5 billion of capital, which includes about $120 million for the Montney acreage acquisition in Canada.","We paid $300 million of dividends and repurchased $500 million of shares, returning 34% of cash from operations back to shareholders in the first quarter. In the red box labeled Other, we included our bolt-on transaction in Alaska for $400 million, which will be moved to capital once we receive final regulatory approval.","As I said before and it is worth emphasizing, this was all done while generating $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which more than funded our dividend and repurchases. Again, a strong financial start to the year.","Now I'll hand the call over to Al to cover operations.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter operating highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year, so please turn to slide 9. Overall, as Don mentioned, production, excluding Libya, averaged 1,224,000 barrels oil equivalent per day, beating the top end of our quarterly production guidance range.","Now as you'll remember, our prior guidance reflected an assumption of a full quarter shut-in of KBB export production in Malaysia due to a third-party pipeline outage. Our production improvements were driven by the power of our diverse portfolio, with contributions from the UK, Alaska and Indonesia, but the majority came from improved performance and completions timing in our Eagle Ford asset.","We had a strong operational quarter in our Big 3 unconventional assets. Production for the Eagle Ford was 163,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken produced 68,000 barrels per day; and the Delaware produced 19,000 barrels per day. That adds to 250,000 barrels per day for the Big 3, representing a 20% increase in production year-on-year.","In addition to the ongoing development operations in the Lower 48, during the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of early lifecycle unconventional acreage in the Austin Chalk of central Louisiana. We're currently in the process of permitting exploration wells and expect to begin drilling in the position later this year.","In Canada, we took steps to mitigate the impacts of the weak WCS differential in the first quarter by piloting the use of condensate as an alternate to synthetic crude diluent at Surmont. We're encouraged by the result so far and believe this unique capability will improve netbacks and provide us a valuable diluent flexibility going forward. Also in Canada, as Don mentioned, we announced our bolt-on in the liquids-rich Montney of 35,000 net acres where we're currently appraising our position.","During the quarter, we also made good progress on many conventional projects in Alaska, Asia-Pacific and Europe. I'll talk about those further on the next slide. In Alaska, we completed our exploration and appraisal drilling program after announcing the acquisition of Anadarko's acreage interest earlier in the quarter. We drilled six wells. Increased drilling efficiency allowed us to add an additional appraisal well to the original five-well exploration scope. This was our largest exploration program in Alaska since 2002 and a successful one.","So far, we've tested four of the Willow discovery and appraisal wells, and the results are in line with our expectations. We confirm that Willow has a recoverable resource potential of more than 300 million barrels. We also drilled three exploration wells, West Willow, Putu and Stony Hill, all of which were new discoveries, confirming that we have additional running room on the western North Slope.","Now I'll discuss the operations outlook as we move into the second quarter on slide 10. Our $5.5 billion capital guidance is unchanged. As you know, this excludes the capital for the previously announced Alaska bolt-on and the Montney acreage acquisitions. We continue to execute the $5.5 billion scope we outlined last November, and we're working to mitigate the pressures on our program from inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and increased partner-operated activity.","For full year, we're increasing our production guidance to 1,200,000 to 1,240,000 barrels per day to reflect our strong performance in the first quarter and adjusting for disposition assumptions. This increase comes despite now assuming that the KBB export volumes will be down for the entire year. In other words, we're confident that due to the strong performance we've seen around the world and especially in the U.S., our diverse portfolio will more than offset the expected roughly 20,000 barrel a day production loss from KBB.","So, based on guidance, we expect to deliver 5% production growth, 7% production growth per share and about 14% production growth per debt-adjusted share. Although that latter number is based on ending the year at $17 billion of debt, based on the $15 billion year-end debt number that Don mentioned earlier, our production growth per debt-adjusted share would increase to about 16%.","Our second quarter production guidance is 1,170,000 to 1,210,000 barrels per day. This assumes our typical 2Q, 3Q turnaround season in APME, Europe and Alaska. In the Lower 48, we'll continue to deliver high-margin production growth in the Big 3 throughout the remainder of the year. We're confident in our Big 3 growth plan. And as I said in the last call, growth may be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but we expect to exit the year at above 300,000 barrels equivalent per day from the Big 3. So, we're executing well on our Big 3 unconventional programs, but we're also executing strongly in the conventional business as well.","Before the end of 2018, we expect to achieve first production from several projects, including Bohai Phase 3 in China, Clair Ridge in the UK, Aasta Hansteen in Norway, GMT1 in Alaska and the final phase of Bayu-Undan development drilling, which will continue feeding the Darwin LNG plant in Australia. We'll be continuing our appraisal work in the Montney and beginning our central Louisiana Austin Chalk appraisal program. We'll also continue to gear up for our 2019 Alaska winter exploration and appraisal program.","So, we had a strong operational quarter, which translated to a strong financial quarter where we executed our plans with capital discipline while generating $1 billion of free cash flow.","Now, I'll turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Al, I wonder if I could start on your CapEx comments that you just alluded to there, I guess. Obviously, inflation pressures have been talked about 5% followers (16:39), but I think the increase in third-party activity I wonder if you could just give it a little bit more color as to what you're seeing there.","And is this really more of a question of it's probably too early still to revisit the spending program. Is just more something you'll likely revisit, let's say, midyear. And if I can risk a third piece to that question, you're lining up a lot of opportunities longer term. So, how do you see, since the Analyst Day, your opportunity set and apart from the CapEx outlook that you guided toward back in November? And I've got a quick follow-up in buybacks, please.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay. Let's see, which...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a CapEx question.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. CapEx, okay. Well, I think as I mentioned, we're still at our $5.5 billion CapEx guidance. We do see pressure, as I mentioned, in three different areas, inflation, forex and OBO. You asked specifically about the partner-operated side. We are seeing considerably above what we had expected ballots from our partners in various areas, dominated in Lower 48.","And so, of course, that will bring volumes with it as well, although a lot of those volumes won't come until next year. But for us, the choice when we received those ballots is, it looks like economic work, which it typically does, we either have to elect in and spend that money or we get into a penalty situation or we lose the rights to those reserves.","So, as that comes in, we're going to elect to do those and that does put some upward pressure on the CapEx. But we're continuing to work to offset those upward pressures with increased efficiencies we're seeing, significant increased efficiencies in our work. And so, it's really too early to tell how all that's going to add up at the end of the day.","With respect to scope going forward, we're still on the plan that we talked about in November at the analyst meeting where we expect to average around this $5.5 billion over that three-year period that we laid out 2018, 2019 and 2020. I mean, there are some things on the horizon that potentially could be incremental opportunities for us down the road. You've heard us talk about the cutter expansion. We're in the running for that and hoping to be able to win a piece of that business. That was not in our plan that we showed you in November. So, obviously, that would be upside. But if we're able to win that, that's something that investors are going to want us to invest in.","You've also seen the exploration success in Alaska. That's another area where that wasn't reflected in our November plans that could be upside. But these are not things that are going to affect 2018 and 2019 CapEx in a big way. It's sort of 2020 and out beyond that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate you indulging the question, Al. And thanks for not cutting him off. My follow-up is really a quick one. The buybacks, we all know what the cash flow outlook is, but you still got your Synovis shares. And now you've got this interesting situation last night that you're now installed (20:04) in PDVSA. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate as to maybe on the PDVSA piece specifically, what are your options there. Is that something that could ultimately result in another kind of step change in buybacks similar to the CDE shareholding that you still have? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, Doug, this is Don. On the PDVSA question, of course, that's a nice award from the ICC tribunal as a result of our arbitration. We have another one coming later this year, probably from exit as well so we'll see what the total of all that is. But that's not something we're going to be able to book a receivable on any time soon. So, I don't think that that's going to require some enforcement action on our part. And we intend to be aggressive and persistent in that, but it's something that's going to take time to recover the value that we lost when they expropriated our assets there. So, I think it's a little too early to start thinking about that in terms of uses of cash.","And then you mentioned Synovis as well. Of course, yeah, we've got somewhere around $2 billion worth of Synovis equity. And really, the story hasn't changed there. We're not a strategic investor, don't intend to be there for the long-term, but we're also not an anxious seller as well. So, we'll wait until we think that the value is right. Right now, we think the company is undervalued. So, someday, we'll be able to liquidate that and put that money to work elsewhere.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for indulging my questions guys. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning. First question just on, you talked about the balance sheet a bit with where prices are now, and it sounds like capital spending is going to \u2013 you're looking to try to offset the inflation and maintain the capital spending budget. So, how do you think about the excess uses of cash, Don? Is there any chance you might put a bit more on the balance sheet just for a rainy day, or even \u2013 obviously, you've done a great job of buying the stock back at what now looks like great prices, but how do you think about that issue on a go forward?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good questions, Phil. With our plan to accelerate the debt reduction and reach our target sometime this year, $15 billion, and then as you say, we're going to continue to constrain capital and work hard to live within our budget there. We've pretty much eliminated two pretty key uses of cash. So, the options are getting narrower. So, what we've said is, I mean, we just increased our buybacks what, two months ago, from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We increased our dividends a couple months ago, 7.5%. So, I can't steer you one way or the other today on that. But we've said that our distributions to the shareholders will continue to grow as our cash flow grows.","What was the second part of your question again, Phil? Oh, on the stock price and the buybacks.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, exactly.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, I tell you what, some of the key factors that we take a look at obviously, the CAGR's on our production growth on a debt-adjusted share basis. And if you look at our cash flow cash margin expansions in this sort of environment, then we think our stock is well undervalued and has a lot of upside to it.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. The first question I had was around APLNG. Am I right to say in the first quarter in the cash flow that there was no dividend recorded from APLNG that came in, in April? And if so, can you quantify what was the cash flow associated with that dividend was?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yes, Neil. That's correct. We did not receive a dividend in the first quarter from APLNG so that's not reflected in the cash flows for the quarter. A dividend was declared in the first quarter, but it was paid in April, this month. So, we did receive a dividend from APLNG and the amount was $105 million to ConocoPhillips.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. And the follow-up question is just the Big 3 production profile for the balance of the year. Can you just talk about where do you see it going from here and a little bit by basin as well? Thank you.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Okay. Yeah, I talked earlier in the prepared remarks about the Big 3 hitting 250,000 barrels per day, so that was up 6% quarter-to-quarter and 20% year-over-year first quarter of 2018 versus first quarter of 2017. And I frankly don't expect you to be too impressed by that 20% number. We said in November, we were going to grow the Big 3 22%, and we keep improving all the time. And the latest well results we've seen have been very impressive. So, I certainly expect our operating teams to beat that 22%. So, I'm not expecting you to be impressed with 20%, and I expect it to be better as we go forward in the year.","I think that it will be lumpy as I said. And some of the lumpiness smoothed out a little bit. We had some Eagle Ford completions that we thought we wouldn't get until the second quarter that sneaked their way into the first quarter. But I think you will see strong numbers as we go through the year.","And just to put a finer point on that, if I can say it without Ellen kicking me under the table maybe, but last call, you may remember I said I thought we would exit \u2013 we'd have an exit rate that would be above 300,000 barrels per day for the Big 3. I think if you look at the latest well performance and how things are going for us, it's clear to me now that, that 300,000 barrels per day that I was kind of calling an exit rate at the last call is going to happen quite a bit earlier in the year.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Congrats on the good quarter guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Hi. Just some quick upstream ones for Al. With Alaska, given the success that you've had, what kind of cycle time should we expect in terms of you actually bringing on incremental production on the North Slope? And then also with the Austin Chalk, when will you start talking about that? Will that be third quarter or fourth quarter?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So, on Alaska, of course, we have a pretty nice pipeline of projects, midsize sort of projects we're bringing on. GMT1 is the one we expect to start up by the end of this year and then GMT2 will be next. We hope to take FID on next year, that would start up in sort of the 2021 timeframe. We've got production still coming up at CD5 and at 1H NEWS. So, a lot of different projects that are in the pipeline there. In terms of the new discoveries, I think is what you're really asking about, Willow, yeah, and also Putu and Stony Hill.","What I said about a year ago on this call when we first announced the Willow discovery, was that in the best case scenario where we got all our approvals, particularly the federal approvals that have been difficult to get in the past timely, the earliest we could start up would be 2023. I think that's still the case, but that's a bit of a theoretical timing that would require more rapid federal permitting than we've experienced in the past, but it is possible within the rules. So, you should sort of think of that as an earliest timeframe, I think, for Willow.","And as one of the questions we've had is, is Willow going to be a tieback or is it going to justify a standalone facility? And so that's part of what we're after in this appraisal program is making sure we understand the subsurface well enough to make the right decision for what's the highest value. And I think we can see from the appraisal work in Willow that it's looking more and more like it'll be able to justify a standalone facility. And then you can have things like West Willow, which is our new discovery further out to the west tying back to that. So that's not a decision we've taken yet, but certainly the appraisal program strength points us in that direction.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. And then what about talking about the Chalk, when will you...?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So, on the Austin Chalk position, so we're up to, I think it's about 211,000 acres now across a pretty wide area. And we're in the process of permitting the first exploration wells, which we'll be able to spud depending on the permit timing later this year, might be late third quarter, early fourth quarter somewhere in that timeframe. So, I expect it'll be into 2019 by the time we actually have results from that program or be able to start to characterize what we think we have there.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay, great. Thanks, Al.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning everybody, and congratulations on your strong results.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good morning, Doug.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah. And, during the quarter, your like-for-like production grew by 4% year-over-year, even with the outage that you guys talked about in Malaysia. So, I want to see, could you comment on the driver of the gains and also the resiliency that you're seeing in the portfolio outside of the Big 3, meaning in areas such as Alaska or Indonesia or really any of the other areas that seem to be exceeding expectations because it certainly appears to be fairly resilient in many areas.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay, sure. I think it's a particularly good question because a lot of the outperformance we're seeing in the first quarter is part of what's given us the confidence to increase our full-year number. We were 24,000 barrels a day above the midpoint of the range we had given in the first quarter. And that was, you're correct, about 4% growth versus that quarter in the prior year. Of course, that's with the loss of 2% from KBB. So, it would have been 6% if we had that. But if you look at where that plus 24,000 comes from, about 11,000 of it was from the Lower 48 as you've kind of alluded to, but we did have strength in a number of other areas.","We continue to outperform with the base in Europe and in both the UK and Norway as we were about a plus 7,000 to expectation from better uptime and better base performance in Europe. As you've heard me talk about before in Alaska, our project and our well performance has been strong there. We got about three more than we expected. In Indonesia, we had higher demand for our gas because of some third-party coal-fired power plants that had unplanned downtime. We picked up a plus 3,000 there. We also had better uptime in cutter and got about plus 3,000 there. The only real negative we had in the quarter was at Surmont. We were about 2,000 short of where we had expected at Surmont, really due to diluent supply shortages and other market factors. So, you add all that up that's plus 24,000 in total.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then also for Don on Venezuela, your point's taken on recoverability from PDVSA given the circumstances. But all around this topic, I want to see if you could give us somewhat of a status update there, damages you're seeking and the next steps for the ICSID proceeding, which I think you alluded to, is going to have a next step later in the year. So, if you could just kind of remind us where we are with that proceeding.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Maybe just to give you a brief recap as well because it is kind of complex because we have multiple proceedings going on there. Of course, one concluded yesterday with ICC. The important thing about the ICC award that was about $2 billion, of course, it doesn't come anywhere close to compensating us for our full losses of value in Venezuela, but it never was expected to. And so, I tried to explain that a little bit. That was a contractual matter between ourselves and PDVSA, and had to do with indemnity that they provided to us for discriminatory actions that the Venezuelans took when they expropriated our assets. And so, the limitation on that indemnity was spelled out in the contract in a formula basically. And that formula had caps on it. So, we knew that that award was always going to be capped and really only would represent a partial compensation for our total losses.","Now we move to the other claim that we have, which is not against PDVSA but against the government of Venezuela, and that's the one that's being heard at exit. And that process \u2013 there is no cap involved in there, and we expect that that result, which we hope to receive notice of an award later this year, that that will represent a full compensation for our value loss.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","All right. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","For Don, a quick \u2013 two one. First is for Don, a quick one. For the APLNG, the $105 million that you're going to receive in the first quarter, does that represent a full cash flow in excess of the internal usage such as the project financing and also the payback (35:34) of the project financing and also the CapEx or that you actually even with that you're already building cash?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","You did mention first quarter. That was received actually in the second quarter, Paul. So, I just wanted to correct that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I understand. I'm just saying that if we're looking at a $67 Brent, does that means that the APLNG, if you assume that you already feel comfortable for the joint venture correspondence going forward, is that $105 million a reasonable estimate or that that should actually be a higher number?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","I have a hard time saying whether that's a reasonable estimate. It all depends on what the price is and what the net cash flow within the joint venture is. I mean, we can just say that it was $105 million in April. Now I can't tell you that...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Let me ask it another way, Don. If you take out $105 million from the cash balance by the end of the first quarter, is that balance higher than year-end within the joint venture?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","That was the available cash \u2013 that was the cash that represents the cash that was available to be distributed.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Maybe I will take it offline. The second one, Al, for the Surmont. Any takeaway issue that, because of the problem over there, that lead you to change the way how you operate?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, I mean, we don't have a takeaway issue per se in terms of being able to move our barrels. The takeaway issue is really the constraints that have been in place for a number of months now that have widened out the WCS differential and really hurt our netbacks. Our netbacks were doing pretty well. We had some pretty decent cash margins at Surmont in the second half of last year. And then as there were a few operational issues that other folks had on pipelines, it did create some backup. And so, one of the things I also mentioned that we've been using synthetic crude oil as our diluent, that's how the plant was set up and there've been some supply issues there, a number of repeating supply issues over the past year, year-and-a-half.","And so, we're moving forward to make what are really some minor, fairly minor facilities changes there that will allow us, by the third quarter of 2019, to be able to run any mix of condensate or synthetic crude oil that we want to as diluent. We can create a Dilbit by running all condensate. We can create a Synbit by running all synthetic crude oil or we can create a Syn\/Dilbit by running a mix. And we're in a process of piloting those sorts of things now. And as we look back at the volatility of the various factors involved here in the market. We think having the flexibility to go back and forth is going to be a really valuable and unique attribute to the Surmont plant.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, do you guys have any committed pipeline warning at the existing pipeline from Alberta down to the Gulf Coast? Or that you are selling all those in the local market?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Let me tell you what our current situation there on the marketing side is, Paul. We're currently, on a blend basis, we're at like 150,000 barrels a day of Surmont blend that we're moving to market. And so, probably on a rough cut basis, the best way to think about that is we have probably around 100,000 barrels a day of that 150,000 barrels a day is going into the local Edmonton trade market. And then we've got about 25,000 barrels a day going to the U.S. by rail. So that would be into Cushing and some into the Gulf Coast as well. And then we have the balance of that 25,000 barrels a day is on pipe being exported into the U.S. into the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. And a nice quarter there. Just, Al, you've been talking and bragging about the 250,000 barrels a day, which certainly is good. We did hear a lot about weather in the quarter as restricting some of the production. So, I was just curious, was your 250,000 barrels a day affected by that somewhat, which means your sort of higher growth rate is more achievable as the year goes along, or are we looking at that as a pretty clean number?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. We were impacted by weather, we don't like to whine about weather. But we were hit about 14,000 barrels a day back in January in a number of our different areas. So, divide by three to get a sort of four or five-ish impact on the quarter, not too big. But we were able to more than offset that with our performance. And so, you don't really need it (41:11) in the math.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I appreciate that. Just trying to get a feel for the exit rate versus maybe the average there. And then...","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Look for the timing on that 300. That's going to be the interesting thing.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate that. We will be watching it. And then my second question, as you look at the decision to make the acquisitions, both in the Montney and Louisiana, you're talking about the CapEx pressures elsewhere. Kind of help us to understand maybe what the kind of the return thought process is there of moving into, I don't want to call them, frontier-ish but I mean, certainly not frontline opportunities for production growth and cash flow. So, like you got the share repo, you've got your other undeveloped reserves and then you're making some additional acquisitions. I was curious how that all kind of flow together.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Well, you could think about it from a number of different perspectives. I mean, for one thing, the money that we spend on some of these bolt-on type opportunities, including in the Western North Slope, really was funded by \u2013 we got our Ecuador legal settlement, $327 million of cash that came in plus in the last few quarters, we've had about $250 million of cash come in from the smaller asset sales we've been doing. And so that $600 million or so has largely funded some of the smaller bolt-on kind of things we've been doing.","Course, the bolt-on in Alaska is \u2013 once we get the regulatory approval, that's immediate. These other things you're asking about, remember, these are sort of $1,000 an acre or less kind of longer term things that are for the 2020s. They're not going to bring us volumes this decade, but they're not costing us much money right now. They fit within. They're a part of our natural exploration budget. So, they'll displace other things in the exploration budget that we had already laid out that was part of our math during the analyst meeting in November. And they are an opportunity to be very competitive, total cycle, full cycle cost of supply with the other things that are in our resource base. That's why we like them.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then if I could sneak one in just to follow Paul on the APLNG on his dividend question. The run rate that generated that was based on kind of what crude price and then how should we think about the fact crude prices moved up certainly from Q4, Q1 to now, how that flows through and maybe the expectation for dividend payments?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, the $105 million was based on the crude prices that they recognized during the first quarter, but also the beginning cash balances as they entered into the year. They had been building some cash up, not a great amount, during the fourth quarter. And I think one thing you have to factor if you're trying to forecast this precisely is that there is, on the LNG sales into Asia, there's always the three-month lag so you've got to lag your prices.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","I think another factor may be that maybe causes some difficulty here is the lumpiness of the loan payments. We don't have a loan payment every quarter.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Twice a year.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","It's twice a year. And so, we build up cash to make the next loan payment, so it's maybe not as ratable as people are thinking.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks, good morning. Don, I was hoping to go back to Phil's question on uses of cash flow. I just wanted to kind of confirm, is the $15 billion debt target subject to being revisited or is that pretty much a hard number? And we can just think once that's accomplished, the rest is just going to simply be distributed.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","That's a hard number.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. The second piece, Al, you kind of talked quite a bit about the Canadian, I guess, discounts and takeaway capacity, et cetera. I'm also curious, obviously, this past quarter, we've seen a lot of discounts in the Permian crude differentials. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what kind of takeaway capacity you have there, how exposed are you to the actual Midland pricing as opposed to getting that down to the coast and realizing something more like LLS?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Maybe I can talk about that a little bit. Right now, we don't have any significant export capacity out of the basin in the Permian. So, we're fully exposed to the Midland\/Cushing differential. Course, in the first quarter, the realizations in the Permian were actually quite high. I think we got around 98% of WTI, but we're going to see the impacts of that, it looks like, in the second quarter. Now looking longer term, a number of the midstream companies are entertaining open seasons on long-haul transport into the Gulf Coast. And we are active in that. But that sort of shipping capacity wouldn't be available until the second half of 2019 at the earliest.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Maybe can I ask a specific one in the Eagle Ford? I mean, you've talked around the issue on how your performance seems to be exceeding expectations there. Can you give any additional color on what you're seeing today in the Eagle Ford versus your original expectations? Is it better per well productivity, drilling efficiencies? Any thoughts on costs there? And then I've got one as a related follow-up.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, it's yes, yes, and yes. By the way, you win the prize for best title this morning on your note. I think in the Eagle Ford, we are seeing better per well performance, our latest generation of completion design. And we have a new generation that we're getting ready to test next that may give us yet even better results. You can go into the public databases and just look at the last four years and look at the different vintages of wells, and you'll see the pretty dramatic improvements that we've had.","We also are continuing to drive down our costs. We're hitting quicker drilling times per well, lower well costs and also continuing to optimize our completion costs. Data analytics is a very powerful course in the Eagle Ford. That was really the first place in the company where we built a comprehensive data warehouse. And that has \u2013 I think in the last few years, we've doubled the number of wells that can be handled by each multi-skilled operator out in the field because of all the tools that we've given them. And we've been able to drive our lifting costs there down well below $2 a barrel. It's very efficient.","So we get great margins out of the Eagle Ford. It's not just a matter of the volumes. We've had improving margins. And while everyone else has been banging away in the Permian, a lot of people left the Eagle Ford to do that, and there's just been less competition for goods and services in the Eagle Ford and better netbacks because there've been less people trying to jam their barrels down the same takeaway capacity. So, everything about the Eagle Ford is really hitting on all cylinders for us. I think that continues to be a real bright spot for us and I think will. So, it's not just \u2013 I think we are going to see really good volumes out of the Eagle Ford this year but there's a lot more to the story than that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe on Darwin LNG, I think you're, based on your partner's comments, you've a recent peak in terms of LNG production there. It seems like there is moving closer to a potential FID at the Barossa backfill options. Any thoughts on what you see the potential timeline there, general thoughts on the asset going forward and maybe insights on potential LNG contracting there?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Sure. The Darwin LNG plant is a great asset. It's a jewel for us that has performed great. We've been able to increase the capacity of that plant significantly over the years since we built, and it's really performed well. We want to keep it full. So, I've seen some things in the press where they've said that ConocoPhillips has been accelerating Barossa or moving faster. That's really not the case. We've been on the same schedule for several years. It's been apparent to us when Bayu-Undan is going to run out of gas and it coincides with when the PSC expires as well and also when our current LNG sales contracts expire. All that happens in 2023.","So we've known for a long time, we've got to have something else ready to flow gas to Darwin in 2023. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we just spud a few weeks ago. We're in the last phase of development drilling at Bayu-Undan. So this will be the last handful of wells that allow us to drain all the gas from Bayu-Undan by 2023.","And then Barossa has been on a steady schedule. I said in the last call that I thought by this call, we'd be at or near entering feed, and that did happen as you saw on the news earlier this week. So we're right on schedule there.","And we expect to take FID in late 2019 if everything continues to move down the tracks. We've already gotten our regulatory approval from, which was \u2013 that's a difficult thing to get. We've got that in hand. We had unanimous vote from the partners this week to move forward into feed on all the different pieces. So, I think everything is working well there. We are very, very focused on this project on capital efficiency. Everything we're doing in the way the feed is set up, including design competition for the FPSO is all designed to really drive forward capital efficiency on that project.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons and Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to go back to cash flow, but in light of the fact that you guys did not receive a dividend from APLNG, the cash generation this quarter seemed especially strong relative to the sensitivities. So, I'm wondering if your simplified cash flow sensitivities actually are conservative now because of some of the margin enhancements you all have highlighted, and because we're now north of $65 a barrel Brent, which was the upper end of the band of the sensitivities, I think, that you provided. And just as one example, it seems that your Lower 48 realizations in particular are really strong relative to TI and Brent and have improved quite a bit perhaps due to Eagle Ford, as you mentioned. But anything more specific you would call out on those Lower 48 realizations or in the Eagle Ford specifically?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","No. I think, Guy, just overall, since we introduced those cash flow sensitivities back in, I think it was November 2016, we've been tracking what, seven or eight quarters six or seven quarters maybe and they've really done well. I mean, they've been very precise in their predictive capacity, I would say. And even in the first quarter, they also came pretty close to what our actual cash flow ex-working capital was. But maybe for some of the wrong reasons because we had the low realizations in Canada but then we had stronger realizations in the Lower 48.","So, I think you're right. The cash flow generating ability of the company may be understated somewhat by the sensitivities that we updated just this past November. So, we are looking at it. And as you say, we are at the upper end of the range pricewise of what we've said those sensitivities are good for. We did take a look at it here in the last couple of weeks and we think it's still okay, but we're going to continue monitoring it. And if we feel like it's no longer has its predictive capability, then we will provide new guidance.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks very much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Hall of Heikkinen. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Hi, good morning.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I guess, first, I wanted to just ask on the KBB pipe you get into a little more detail on what exactly is creating the delays on bringing that back on. Are there any issues with the metallurgy there? What sort of costs might be associated with repair and\/or replacement of the pipe? And is that all factored into CapEx at the moment?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So, the KBB pipe, there's no issue around metallurgy. We have no ownership in the pipe and so there's no impact on cost to us. It's just strictly a third-party arrangement. And so really what the cost is not a factor for us. They had a weld failure that was really caused by a mudslide. So this is a remote area with some pretty difficult terrain and heavy rains and sort of the earth moved and caused excess strain on the pipe. So, the problem is, it's a very difficult area for them to get to, and there's a number of these potential mudslide areas. And so they have a lot of very comprehensive plan of repair for the pipeline and we expect we don't really know when the pipeline's going to be up, and we're not really in the middle of it because we have no ownership. And so, we're assuming at this point, it will be down for the whole year. We don't really know that for sure.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Appreciate clearing that up. And then just curious as a follow-up on the Permian. You noted obviously things are looking tough on the differentials on the forward. Things get bad enough in the Permian from a price realization standpoint starts to weigh on valuations in the basin. Is that an area you guys would consider being opportunistic and on a longer databases or is that not really in the agenda?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, I mean, we never say never. We're always looking at everything but that's not \u2013 I don't really see that. You look at the pricing on recent things that have happened. And on a full cycle basis, we struggle to see how that would compete in our existing portfolio that we've showed you the cost of supply of our existing portfolio and you just do the math on the prices being paid and it's hard to see how that works. But things could change, you never know.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one more question about the Permian from a gas perspective. Obviously, a lot of conversation about constraints in gas takeaway capacity and the possibility of flaring later this year or next year, are you experiencing any pressure to that sort in terms of your gas volumes in the Delaware?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","No, we really not and we don't expect to either. ConocoPhillips is one of the largest gas marketers in the United States. And the U.S. Southwest, including the Permian area all the way out to the SoCal border is an area that we're very large and very active. So, we transport a lot of third-party gas out of that basin and across the U.S. And so, we have plenty of capacity available for our equity gas. And if we ever got in a bind, we can back out third-party gas.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications, for closing remarks.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, everybody.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP Investor Relations and Communications, ConocoPhillips.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Christine, and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Our speakers this morning are Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, and Matt Fox, our EVP of E&P.","Let me take care of a couple of quick administrative matters. First of all, I wanted to make sure that all of you saw the note in this morning's earnings release that we plan to announce our 2016 capital budget on December 10th. We also plan to host a conference call in conjunction with that release and the reason is to provide some additional details about our operating and financial plans that will include some specifics on our CapEx, our operating costs, our volumes and also a brief region and program overview. That's a bit of a departure for us but we think a very good and early opportunity to share our plans for next year, particularly given the ongoing market uncertainty. We will provide the details for that call very shortly.","Now if you turn to Page 2 you will see our Safe Harbor language. We will make some forward-looking statements this morning, and the risks and uncertainties in our future performance are described on this slide and also with our periodic filings with the SEC. And then finally once again during Q&A we'll limit questions to one plus a follow-up, that way we can hope to get everybody through the queue within our planned hour.","And now I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sheets","Thank you, Ellen, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Before reviewing the quarter, I will make a few brief comments about how we're addressing the current low commodity prices environment, which is clearly impacting financial performance across the sector. This down-cycle poses significant challenges and we're taking aggressive actions across our business to position for low and more volatile oil prices in the future.","These actions plus our unique portfolio characteristics are the key to delivering on our value proposition through the cycles. Over the past few years we've high graded the portfolio, organically grown a world-class position in North American unconventional plays and are nearing completion on several major projects. We are increasing our capital flexibility, lowering the underlying cost structure of the business and continuing to reduce exposures to assets that won't compete for capital in our portfolio including deepwater exploration and North American natural gas.","As we go through the call today, you should be listening for a few key messages. The underlying operational performance of the business is very strong, we continue to exercise capital flexibility and are further reducing our planned 2015 CapEx spending. We are accelerating reductions in our operating costs and we're on track to exceed our cost reduction target in half the time we expected. We're in strong shape financially and finally we're closing the gap on cash flow neutrality. These actions set us up well for 2016 and beyond. As Ellen mentioned we look forward to providing more details about our 2016 operating plans in December.","So while the current environment continues to test the sector, we are focused on the things we can control and moving decisively to position ourselves for a market with greater price uncertainty.","So with that said let's dive into the quarterly results starting on Slide 4. The key theme for the quarter is the underlying business continues to perform very well. We produced 1.554 million BOE per day, which is 4% growth year over year.","Matt will cover operations in more detail but let me hit the high points.We achieved first oil from our Surmont 2 megaproject, which should continue ramping up through 2017. We also brought on our Drill Site 2S and CD5 projects online in Alaska during October. We brought six major projects online so far this year and we expect to deliver cargoes from the seventh, our APLNG, project before year-end.","Clearly, earnings were challenged given weak commodity prices. Our adjusted loss of $0.38 per share was in line with consensus. Cash flow from operations is $1.3 billion. This looks low and it excludes impacts of working capital changes; when you adjust for special items, including the rig termination, restructuring costs and pension settlement expense in the quarter, that $1.3 billion is more like $1.6 billion. So about what you'd expect in this price environment given the impact of higher cost and lower production related to turn-around activity this quarter in our Alaska, UK and Malaysia business units.","These three business units had 40,000 barrels per day of lower production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. These turnarounds are now complete and the high-margin oil weighted production from these business units will return in the fourth quarter. Operating costs were down 18% when adjusted for special items and we'll talk about that more in a minute. And we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash.","On the strategic front we modestly increased our quarterly dividend in July. This was an important signal to the market that our dividend continues to be a top priority. We also announced our plan to further reduce deepwater exploration spending and began implementing a phased exit. As previously announced, we booked the rig termination fee this quarter. Finally, we are progressing several non-core asset dispositions across the portfolio that provide additional sources of cash. We'll provide an update on these activities in December.","So now let's look at our financial performance on Slide 5. The story for earnings is weak commodity prices. Realized prices were down 16% sequentially and 49% on a year-over-year basis. As a result we reported an adjusted loss of 466 million or the $0.38 share. The lower commodity prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating cost after adjusting for special items. Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown on the lower right side of this slide. Segment adjusted earnings are roughly in line with our sensitivities. And the financial details for each segment can be found in the supplemental data on our Web site. So it was a tough quarter financially. But the underlying business performance remains strong.","Moving to Slide 6 I'll cover our production results. Our third quarter production from continuing operations excluding Libya averaged 1.554 million BOE per day compared to 1.473 per day in the same quarter last year. Adjusting out 25,000 BOE per day due to lower third quarter downtime and dispositions we achieved growth of 4% or 56,000 BOE per day. Our growth continues to come primarily from North American liquids and APLNG ramp gas which will soon become liquids priced LNG. On a price normalized basis this should help drive margins and returns.","Now if you will turn to the next slide I will cover our year-to-date cash flow waterfall. This chart summarizes our year-to-date sources and uses of cash. Starting at the left we began the year with 5.1 billion of cash. Through September we generated 5.8 billion from operating activities excluding working capital. Working capital over this period was a $600 million use of cash. Through three quarters we received 600 million in disposition proceeds. As we mentioned we previously -- we currently have several assets on the market. We expect several of them to close this year and we'll provide an update in December. As we said before you should expect us to generate $1 billion to $2 billion per year as part of our routine high grading process. We increased debt by 2.4 billion during the second quarter but added no debt in the third quarter. Through the third quarter we've spent 7.9 billion in capital, paid our dividend and ended with 2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","We believe we're in strong shape financially. Between cash on hand, debt capacity within a single A credit rating and expected asset sales proceeds we have the means to manage through the current period of low prices. That was a pretty quick recap of the financial results for the quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt who will go through the operational performance and close with a 2015 guidance update. What you're going to hear is we're driving positive momentum in the business. All things equal these steps we're taking should drive improved 2016 earnings and cash flow. So I will turn it over to Matt.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned we performed very well this quarter operationally. We successfully completed several major turnarounds, continue to bring major projects online and exceeded our production targets. I will now quickly run through the segment results and then we will move on to your questions. So let's start with Slide 9.","In the lower 48 third quarter production averaged 551,000 BOE per day. That's a 1% increase from the same period last year and a 1% decrease sequentially. Importantly, though this represents a 12% increase in our crude oil year-over-year. We're currently running 13 rigs in the lower 48, six in the Eagle Ford, four in the Permian, four in the Bakken and three in the Permian, one of which is in the unconventionals. And we're delivering more for less across our programs. In fact, we have seen 20% to 30% lower drilling and completion costs compared to a year ago. About half of that\u2019s driven by program efficiencies and about half is from deflation capture. Production from these three unconventional plays was 249,000 BOE per day this quarter. That's an increase of 28,000 barrels versus the third quarter last year but a decrease of 6,000 barrels a day sequentially.","As we forecasted, given our current level of rig activity from production from these plays plateaued in the third quarter and we'd expect to see a modest decline in the fourth quarter. Clearly 2016 production will depend on the level of capital flexibility we choose to exercise. However, you should not expect us to increase capital in these plays at current prices. Despite our stated plans to reduce deepwater exploration spending over time we're continuing to fund activity based on existing commitments while we also progress possible monetization options. This is important for protecting the value we've created from our existing program. In the Gulf of Mexico we had encouraging results from the recent Shenandoah appraisal well. We're currently drilling the Vernaccia and Gibson exploration wells and we expect to spud the Melmar prospect this quarter.","In Canada we produced 315,000 BOE per day, a 14% increase year-over-year. This growth came mostly from strong well performance, ramp up at Foster Creek Phase F and lower planned downtime. We achieved a major milestone during the quarter with first oil at our Surmont 2 oil sands project. This project will continue ramping up through 2017 and at full production we expect to increase Surmont's total gross capacity to 150,000 BOE per day. We spudded the Cheshire exploration well offshore Nova Scotia this month. And that's the first of two exploration well commitments.","Next let's review our Alaska and Europe segments on Slide 10. Alaska's average production was 160,000 BOE per day, an increase of 3% compared to last year's third quarter due to lower planned downtime. We successfully completed several major project turnarounds during the quarter at Prudhoe and Kuparuk. We recently achieved two keep project milestones with first oil from CD5 and Drill Site 2S in October. At peak production, we expect these projects to contribute about 15,000 barrels a day of crude. So we're seeing the benefits of project activity that will help to keep our Alaska production relatively flat for the next several years.","We completed our six cargo export program from Kenai in 2015 with the last cargo delivered in October. And we applied for a license from the DOE to continue our export program in 2016. Moving to Europe, third-quarter production averaged 192,000 BOE per day. We had several major turnarounds across the UK that were all completed successfully. And we're continuing development drilling at Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II in Norway.","Now I'll cover the Asia-Pacific and Middle East and other international segments on Slide 11. In the AP&ME segment we produced 332,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. This is a 10% increase from the same period last year driven by Gumusut and increased ramp gas from APLNG. In Malaysia, Gumusut underwent its first major turnaround, which was completed ahead of schedule. In Australia, we expect APLNG Train 1 to deliver its first cargo in the fourth quarter. On the downstream project, all the mechanical runs are complete. And on the upstream project 14 of the 15 gas processing facilities are now fully commissioned.","In other international, the Athena rig from Angola has arrived in Senegal where we expect to conduct a six well exploration and appraisal program starting now and extending into next year. And in Libya, production remains shut-in as a result of the ongoing regional instability.","So let me close on the next slide by giving you some updated guidance for 2015, and summarizing the key takeaways from our call. The title of this slide says it all. We're reducing our 2015 CapEx, reducing our 2015 operating cost and delivering strong underlying business performance. Like Jeff mentioned, this will help drive solid momentum into 2016. On the production front, we now expect to exceed our full year 2015 production guidance. That's in large part due to delivering our seven major project startups this year.","We expect to achieve fourth quarter production of 1.585 million to 1.625 million BOE per day. And that puts our full year 2015 guidance range at 1.585 million to 1.595 million BOE per day. And as the chart shows, this represents 3% to 4% growth from continuing operations, excluding Libya, up from the 2% to 3% we expected at the start of the year.","The table captures several other key guidance items and shows the progress we've made since 2014 and through 2015. The far right column is our current 2015 guidance and all of these numbers exclude special items. We now expect our 2015 capital spending to come in at $10.2 billion. That's a 40% decrease from 2014, an 11% decrease from our initial outlook for 2015. About half of the reduction was related to market factors like FX and deflation and about half is due to discretionary deferrals and program efficiencies.","On operating costs, we're now guiding to $8.2 billion for 2015. And that's a 15% reduction compared to 2014. You remember in April, we set a target to reduce operating costs in 2016 by $1 billion compared to 2014. And what our revised 2015 operating cost guidance represents is an acceleration of this effort. In fact, we've now exceeded our $1 billion target in half the time.","About half of these savings came from market factors like deflation and FX impacts but the rest came from steps we've taken to lower the cost structure of the business through G&A reductions, new operating philosophies and supply chain efficiencies. And we're not done yet.","We're also changing our full year corporate segment guidance to a net expense of $800 million and that's a 20% reduction from initial 2015 guidance. I'll close by repeating the key messages you should take from this call. The underlying operational performance of the business is very strong. We continue to exercise capital flexibility and we're further reducing our planned 2015 capital spending. We're accelerating reductions in our operating costs and are on track to exceed our cost reduction target in half the time we expected. And finally, we're in very strong shape financially.","So we're all focused on safely and successfully executing our operations while positioning the Company to be more flexible and resilient to deliver on our long-term commitments to shareholders. We look forward to providing more details of our operating plan for 2016 in December. So now I will turn the call over to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody. In U.S. unconventional in that arena industry productivity gains were pretty significant in recent years but more recent data indicates that we have had a slowdown even though company seem to be drilling their best resources and using optimal technology and personnel too. So while this could be a blip in the data it could also be that technological limits are being reached by some and that science might play a greater role in recovery rate capture in the future. So I just wanted to get your insights into this paradigm or maybe into this transition that\u2019s underway, that is if you think that there is one. And also based on your experience and with your credentials where do you think we are in understanding the shale resource overall?","Matt Fox","So Doug I think from our perspective the sweet spots really matter, so you're going to get the best performance out of the sweet spots. And you're probably right that people are focusing, they are just now with a limited number of rigs running. But I wouldn't say that our perspective is that we've reached any sort of technological limit. We're continuing to see encouraging results from our pilot tests on different well spacings. We're continuing to run our stimulated rock volume pilot in the Eagle Ford and learning a lot that's going to allow us to optimize well spacing and completions in the future. And even in the Bakken we're moving from open hole slide and sleeve completions to cemented liner and plug-n-perf. We're seeing improvements there from our pilot tests. So from our perspective we're not seeing ourselves in any technology limit yet.","Doug Terreson","Okay, Matt. So I don't disagree with that but it seems like the industry may be slowing down somewhat. So I recognize it's hard for you to maybe attribute that to other factors because it's not your company but do you have any insight as to what may be those drivers?","Matt Fox","We see that in other people's individual well performance. But I'm not quite sure what to attribute that to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin","Yes, hi. I know you're going to announce your CapEx budget for next year on the 10th of December but from a portfolio management perspective is it safe to say that you're focusing more on short and intermediate term time projects or and deferring kind of a longer-term type business?","Matt Fox","Really what's going to happen for us John is as we move from \u201815 into \u201816 we're seeing about $2 billion of major project spend roll-off as we complete in particular Surmont and APLNG. So we have a choice as to what to do with that and the additional capital flexibility that's appearing and we could redirect it to shorter cycle or we could just hold on and hold onto those opportunities for another time. And that's exactly the sort of detail we're going to provide in the December call.","John Herrlin","Okay. Next one for me is a quickie. Ducks you're hearing a lot of companies now say the concept du jour is to accumulate uncompleted wells. Is that part of your MO?","Matt Fox","No, it's not. Our view is that if you don't want to complete the well don't drill them. So we don't have a strategy to drill wells and then intentionally not complete them. We are reducing the number of uncompleted wells as we've gone through this year. We started the year with about 135 wells that were uncompleted and we'll end the year with about 95 wells but that's just the sort of natural course of executing our program. It's not a deliberate choice to drill wells and not complete them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I've got a couple of questions also if I may. First of all, on I guess there was a curious statement in the release about disposals, Matt. And just kind of thinking out loud about headcount reduction, large capital projects coming online, you've got a very large tail of non-operated relatively small assets, particularly in light of a potential exit in the Gulf of Mexico. So I'm just wondering order of magnitude you've got 80,000 barrels a day of gas equivalent in the U.S. that my understanding is you're marketing. What do you think the scale of the non-core disposals if you want to call it that stands at once you get those big projects online and what's the likely timeline to see some movement on the asset sales?","Matt Fox","Doug, I mean it's no secret that we've got several non-core assets on the market including the North American gas assets. But we're not ready to give details of those at this time. We are going to give some more detail in December. But what you should expect is something of the order of $1 to $2 billion annually. But we are going to give you more detail in December, but it's not appropriate for us to go into detail just now.","Doug Leggate","Annually means a number of years on it, Matt. What are we talking about one year or five years or what?","Matt Fox","I would say that on average over any period of time we should be cleaning the portfolio and that could be $1 billion to $2 billion a year. So annually, yes.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up is on Jeff maybe on cash flow. It looks like cash flow was operating cash flow was a little weak this quarter and I'm trying to decipher what was going on at the affiliate level. And thinking about your $60 cash breakeven by 2017 and obviously the cost reductions announced today, so can you just help reconcile what was going on with the cash flow this quarter and where do you think that cash breakeven now stands after your latest round of cost reductions? And I will leave it there, thanks.","Jeff Sheets","On the affiliate level, we really have three major equity affiliates. You have the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands joint venture, the APLNG project in Australia and the QG3 project in Qatar. Of those three, two of them are still in a fairly heavy investment phase. So for the APLNG, we don't get any cash distributions out of there. It's all retained to cover capital.","In FCCL this year it's the same kind of story, all the cash flow is being retained to fund capital there and we do get some distributions out of QG3.","As we move forward in 2016 and 2017 with a startup of APLNG and as additional phases and we would assume some price recovery happens for Foster Creek and Christina Lake, we expect that we would see distributions coming out of all three of those joint ventures. And as we've talked previously that's a pretty significant source of cash flow to bring us closer to cash flow neutrality.","As we've also talked before, as we think about cash flow neutrality in 2017, we have increasing levels of capital flexibility, increasing production levels to where we feel like we're going to be able to get there at a pretty broad range of commodity prices. So there's not really just kind of one commodity price number that we point out as what it takes for us to get to cash flow neutrality in 2017.","Doug Leggate","So nothing specific this quarter that's caused the cash flow to lag?","Jeff Sheets","Well, I mean we had a unique effect this quarter if you look at the $1.3 billion in cash from operations before working capital and $1.9 billion after working capital. $1.9 billion of after working we had $600 million of working capital impact. We had the rig termination fee, which we took against earnings but didn't hit cash, but ended up hitting cash before working capital because it caused a shift in working capital. A similar effect happened on our restructuring costs, so when we made the comment in the slide -- as we went through the slides you should think about that $1.3 billion being more like $1.6 billion. It's taking account of the impact of just those special items.","And as we also pointed out this is, the third quarter always is a weak cash flow quarter for us because it tends to be the quarter where we have the most turnaround activity. In this quarter, we lost about 40,000 barrels a day roughly in our Malaysia, our UK and our Alaska business units because they are the ones who went through turnaround. And that is pretty heavily weighted to oil production. And when you think about what happens in a turnaround, you're losing the revenue but you are still keeping all your normal costs and then you're having the costs associated with the turnaround itself. So the net margin you're losing when you have a turnaround is pretty high on those barrels.","Doug Leggate","That's helpful, thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Just a couple of questions for me as well, little more specific on some of the unconventional U.S. resource plays, you know the Eagle Ford and Bakken it sounds like at the current activity levels the expectations is production is starting to slide a little bit. Is that true if we remained in this somewhat $45, $50 environment and more direct what price would allocate more capital to those areas?","Matt Fox","If we stay at our current level of rigs in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, we would expect to see some modest decline. So for example if we go from this year into next year and we don't increase rigs we'll see 3% to 5% decline on our production in the unconventionals. We're going through the process of setting our operating plan and budget for 2016 and we'll give you a little more detail on what we actually decide to do with that rig count at that time. But just as a sort of reference if we stay at the current rig rate it will be 3% to 5% decline in our unconventional production.","Scott Hanold","Okay, I appreciate that. Good color. And one other thing on I guess the sales goals, Jeff rather than try to be too specific as far as what you're selling and timing on it but just specifically can you give us a broad sense of what really are the goals of these asset sales? Is it cleaning up the portfolio, is it help bridging a cash flow deficit to keep a strong dividend? And I guess my point is if commodity prices do eventually improve does that become less important to Conoco?","Jeff Sheets","It's a combination of those factors. These are predominantly going to be asset sales that we would be doing regardless of a commodity price environment. If you think about it a portfolio of our size we're always going to be in the process of trying to find the assets someone else wouldn't value more highly than we do. So as we've talked about its things like some parts of our North American natural gas portfolio might fit in that category. The other thing that we think about in terms of asset sales are what assets are just not going to make the cut for us to fund capital for them. Someone who might be more willing to fund that capital would they have a different value perspective on those? So it's always a bit of a combination. But predominantly these are assets that are going to be part of any of a rationalization process in most commodity price environments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber","Good afternoon everybody. I wanted to dive into the production the little bit, but hoping you could just address the major project performance, how those projects a ramping up relative to expectations? And specifically if you could just remind us of the incremental production from those projects latest view in 2016 and 2017? Just trying to understand that base level of growth that's coming on as the CapEx begins to decline.","Matt Fox","Yes, so the major projects are ramping up. And Gumusut is coming in. The expectations we've had the turnaround there that I mentioned which has allowed us to get the gas injection established. And so it's ramping up and getting close to full capacity. APLNG is ramping up gas in anticipation of having the LNG plant full for the first train. Surmont has really just literally just started producing oil in September. And that's going to gradually ramp up over the next 12 to 15 months. So if you just looked at those three projects alone in aggregate by 2017 we're probably looking at 150,000 or so barrels a day of incremental production from those three projects, maybe 120 because Gumusut is already there.","Guy Baber","And then I wanted to dive into thoughts around capital allocation and the deepwater portfolio a little bit more, specifically on development capital towards deepwater and offshore. But do you have flexibility to slow your offshore development CapEx next year, the year after and is that something that you would consider in this environment at this point in time?","Matt Fox","We have announced that we're going to be exiting deepwater exploration, although we do have quite a significant program that we're executing next year. Development of the discoveries that we have in deepwater is quite some way off and we may choose to stay with those developments but we may choose to exit before development happens there. So really what we're in just now is a ramping down of exploration commitments and continuing appraisal on the existing discoveries. We're not at a development stage yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Good afternoon. First question is just on the equity affiliates again. In the oil sands your partner on FCCL noted that they are contemplating restarting some of the project phases in 2016 that could add up to another 500 million in CapEx on the base level of spend. So as this happens the equity affiliate source of cash for you guys would be lower and I assume that's not what you're contemplating at this stage. But maybe you could just talk about where oil sands projects rank in terms of your relative priorities of cash post Surmont to the extent your partner wants to move forward on this?","Matt Fox","Yes, so we obviously engage in the budgeting process with our partner there and that's a pretty collaborative process. Historically what we've done here is we've funded the additional growth in FCCL from within the joint venture from cash that's generated within the joint venture rather than taking distributions out. And those are good projects at Foster and Christina, so we'll have a good discussion at the management committee on what the right pace is to develop those. But it won't influence distributions per se because we really haven't been taking distributions out of FCCL. We've been intending to reinvest in the sort of gradual increase in production as we add more phases there.","Phil Gresh","Okay yes. I was referring more to just the expectation moving forward that you will be taking distributions. But I didn't know if more growth would hinder that. Jeff, I don't know if you have a comment on that.","Jeff Sheets","Well, at the same time that they are talking about these investments you have to also keep in mind that production levels from both Foster Creek and Christina Lake continue to increase. And we've been at a period where we've had low commodity prices and pretty wide differentials. So the net result has been some pretty weak realizations. So there's quite a bit of leverage to increases in prices that can happen there as well. So you've got what is probably price increases happening both on the differential and the flat price side and increased production that's going to provide more capability to fund increased investment as well.","Phil Gresh","And my follow-up is just on the production, the increase in the production target for this year.","Would you say that's more of a pull forward on just executing on major capital projects faster or is it something that would indicate a sustainably higher growth rate that we should be thinking about for 2016?","Matt Fox","It's not really associated with major project acceleration. It's more an indication of the performance of our base and the managing our base decline and the performance we're getting from our new development wells across the portfolio as a whole.","Phil Gresh","Sure, okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","You've done a tremendous amount this year as shown on the slides, but when we look at it let's say $50 oil this year you've made about -- it looks like a run rate of about $8 billion cash flow. I guess that's obviously not a fair number. Can you guide us towards what the real run rate will be given what you've achieved? And secondly perhaps update us given all the movements on the sensitivities of cash flows or earnings to dollar changes in the oil price. I'm assuming they've gone up. Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","The sensitivities that we've provided are still pretty close. We'll give you some updated sensitivities to that in December that will reflect the latest view. But they're not going to be largely different than what you've seen currently. We're also -- in December we'll be giving you a better picture of what 2016 will be looking like in terms of how to think about cost relative to this year and how to think about capital costs relative to this year.","But just overall the picture like we said when we look at the balance of cash flow and the proceeds that we're likely to get from asset sales when we compare that to what we think capital is going to be, and the dividend, we see a picture that is very manageable for us from a balance sheet perspective in order to get to the point where we get to cash flow neutrality balance still within the 2017 time frame within the capacity that we have on our balance sheet.","Paul Sankey","Yes, I guess what I'm driving at is it feels like that price, the price of oil required for that has come down over the course of the last year, since your last update. I will go with a follow-up which is kind of related but you said here that you're in a phased exit of deepwater exploration. I assume that means that you'll be selling out of positions and that will form part of the disposal program that you've talked about which is very significant, I think $1 billion to $2 billion a year.","I would assume that that's a phased exit which will sort of be a one-way street. Once you've left you'll be gone and I would also anticipate that would involve selling leases. I know you've got a major position for example in the Gulf of Mexico. Am I heading in the right direction here in terms of how you're looking at this? Thanks.","Matt Fox","Yes, that's right, Paul.","Paul Sankey","Can you just remind us how big your position is in the Gulf of Mexico? Because I know it's top three.","Matt Fox","In the Gulf we've got about 2.2 million acres in the Gulf and three existing discoveries and our intention is to not be doing deepwater exploration by 2017. And those acreage positions that we hold that we don't intend to drill, we will be marketing those positions.","Paul Sankey","Yes, understood. And that becomes then as I said and you sort of agreed, I hope I didn't trap you, that that becomes a one-way street. I mean effectively over time you're simply leaving the deepwater and won't come back.","Matt Fox","That's right. This is a strategic decision to leave -- to exit deepwater exploration. That's exactly right.","Paul Sankey","Great, that's very clear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Just I think maybe several months ago that you and Matt talking about to sustain your operation is about $8 billion which was down from $9 billion say maybe from last year. So are we still talking about $8 billion given that you have actually accelerated your cost reduction and everything or that this number is now $7 billion or $7.5 billion?","Jeff Sheets","It's hard to talk about that number without some context around what kind of environment we think we're in. If we had a continuation of the type of environment we've seen today, we do think we'd be talking about a number that was smaller than $8 billion. But it's in that same kind of range.","Paul Cheng","And maybe this is for Matt. You are currently running about 13 rigs and you're saying that the third quarter production -- the fourth quarter production will be modestly down. So my guess is that, what is the number of rigs that you think you need in order to hold the production flat? And what kind of CapEx requires that you have that kind of program?","Matt Fox","So to keep Eagle Ford production flat probably requires between seven and eight rigs. Currently we're running six. The Bakken requires about closer to five rigs. We're currently running four. So you'd be looking at maybe three additional rigs to maintain production flat. And if you look at all-in cost, drill complete hook-up and so on you can use an order of magnitude of $150 million.","Paul Cheng","An additional 150 million?","Matt Fox","No, per rig line per year. So maybe $400 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","I guess come back around on the Gulf of Mexico or just deepwater in general you mentioned earlier on the call you had a further appraisal in Shenandoah. Should we think of the exit of exploration also including the exit of not yet developed but partially explored?","Matt Fox","Possibly but only if we get full value for it. We're willing to stay in our discoveries if that's what maximizes the value. So we haven't made a commitment to exit deepwater per se but it's the deepwater exploration but if we saw full value for those assets then we'd certainly consider that.","Roger Read","Okay. And can you give us an idea of what the capital flexibility is once you're away from deepwater exploration or any other type of exploration you're not planning to do by \u201817? And then if I understood correctly it doesn't sound like the oil sands necessarily gets incremental CapEx and we can presume that there is not another LNG project. So as we look at the total CapEx number sort of as I guess a starting point for when you talk about it in December kind of where we can see that CapEx flexibility that could come back in to the shale plays in future years?","Matt Fox","Well I guess to give you a bit of a preview of the 2016 budget we expect to spend about $800 million in 2016 in the deepwater exploration and appraisal space. And so that's the order of magnitude on the capital side that we wouldn't be spending if we weren't doing deepwater exploration and appraisal for one year. And then there's G&G and G&A associated with that as well.","Jeff Sheets","And that number Matt noted is a fairly consistent number with what we're spending there in 2015 as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Bob Brackett","Hi, I've got kind of a high level, more philosophic question on the 2016 capital plan ahead of getting the details. One is simple, what sort of price stick would you be looking at in terms of thinking about your cash flow from operations next year?","Jeff Sheets","We don't have one price stick that we use. As we talk about we are preparing the company to deal with low and volatile prices, so we're going to be ready to handle whether we get a continuation of current prices, whether we get some recovery that's not really going to be a determining factor in exactly where we set our capital program.","Bob Brackett","Okay. And then how do you prioritize the sources of cash for that program and the sort of sinks or the uses of cash? What's the pecking order?","Jeff Sheets","So we're going to use cash flow from operations to fund the capital and the dividend. We're going to have some amount of asset sales proceeds that come in from things that we're currently marketing and other things that we might market. We're going to, we will first use the cash that's on our balance sheet and then to the extent that cash from operations and asset sales don't fully fund capital in the dividend we'll be looking to increase debt. I mean that it's just a mechanic of what's going to end up happening for us. And as we said as we look at the amount of debt that we might need to raise even in some continuations of some pretty tough price environments we feel comfortable that that capacity exists on our balance sheet. And it really exists within a single A credit rating as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Good morning. I had two questions but if I could first just kind of confirm Ellen, the December 10th capital update, is that in lieu of the typical Analyst Day we would have in April?","Ellen DeSanctis","We're still thinking about all that but our big concern here is not asking the market to wait until April to see the details of what our current year plan is. So at this point you can count on December being a pretty big update on the company's plans and programs for the year.","Blake Fernandez","In the past I believe you've provided some kind of rate of return or breakeven levels for the major projects including Surmont and APLNG and seeing how those are two kind of major contributors near-term I'm just wondering could you provide us with an update as far as what you think a breakeven price is for oil, whether those are actually accretive to net income or earnings per share?","Jef f Sheets","I don't have that off the top of my head.","Blake Fernandez","That's fine. That's fine. Maybe I can follow up with\u2026","Jef f Sheets","Yes, we can come back to you on that","Blake Fernandez","Not a problem. I will get back with side on that. The last one is just kind of more of a broader picture question I guess. I'm just curious if the Board ever has a discussion about the shareholder payout. I know you're very committed to the dividend and you're trying to maintain that shareholder base. But when you look at the stock trading from the call it mid-80s down into the 50s, is there any consideration whatsoever to maybe shift that ratio towards maybe a buyback program or even toward capturing M&A opportunities instead of pure dividend payout?","Jeff Sheets","We've been pretty consistent. Since we started ConocoPhillips as an independent E&P, we thought the way to create value in the business, was a combination of moderate growth and strong payouts back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend. We think of a dividend as something that really should only go one direction and there can be some variability in the rate at which dividend increases. But the key to a dividend is to have it be consistent and to grow it over time.","So we haven't really had significant discussion to talk about trying to adjust the dividend. It's an important part of our value proposition. It puts a lot of discipline into the system to have that dividend. So you've heard us talk about it pretty consistently. You're going to continue to hear us talk about that as a key component of our value proposition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","So I want to start off on the LNG market, been a lot of debate and discussion around that. We've got APLNG coming in here in the next couple of weeks, so any thoughts on the LNG markets broadly? And then there has been some investor concern around Sinopec and the APLNG contracts. Just any updated thoughts there and anything you can say that can help investors get comfort around that risk?","Matt Fox","Clearly, the short-term LNG market is pretty weak. Whether you're tied to oil prices or you're in the spot market it's a pretty weak price that we're getting for LNG going forward. And there's not a lot that we can do about that. But with respect to the Sinopec contract at APLNG, so that's a take-or-pay contract. Sinopec have the right to divert cargoes within China. We've also given them the right to divert cargoes outside China but as a take-or-pay contract and with a price formula that's tied to oil.","Then we have got no reason to believe that there is any issue with that contract. Sinopec in fact is a 25% shareholder in APLNG on the upstream project. So we don't have any concerns if that's what you're indicating about the sanctity of that contract.","Neil Mehta","And then Jeff, on the operating and CapEx reductions that were announced relative to the July guidance, can you just help bridge the gap from what are the drivers that get you from $8.9 billion to $8.2 billion and then on the CapEx side from $11 billion to $10.2 billion where are all the cats and dogs there?","Jeff Sheets","We just put it in kind of broad categories. Like we talked about before it's really the same things that have brought it down the first increment. It's a mix of what we'd call macro factors, just continued deflation out there in the industry and also continued strength of the U.S. dollar, lowering both our capital and operating costs in Canada, Norway and Australia. But it's also it's about half that and it's about half things that we're doing, efficiencies that we're forcing through the system, changes that we're making in to how we run the Company, lower employee headcount numbers. It's really more of the same compared to the reductions that took the first increment of our guidance down.","Neil Mehta","That's great. And one last question from me. You guys have the advantage of seeing the world when it comes to oil production. Curious on your views and when we're going to see non-OPEC ex-U.S. production really start to fall off and the decline rates start to materialize, which is going to be central to rebalancing these markets.","Matt Fox","I'm not sure when we're going to see it, but it's going to come Neil. And the people are adjusting their capital programs where they have the flexibility to do that. So that will be things like infill drilling where they have rig contract flexibility. People are exercising operating cost flexibility, too, which means less work-overs, less spinning spheres and so on. So over time that's going to materialize in the non-OPEC non-U.S. production, but exactly when and what magnitude is hard to tell, that is coming.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Couple of quick ones, disposals $1 billion to $2 billion, probably there was some disposals in your prior plan to get to 1.7 million barrels a day. But can you just give us a sort of maybe an endpoint kind of impact that it might make as you reshape the outlook?","Matt Fox","The 1.7 million barrels a day in 2017 that we talked about in April there was no assumption of dispositions in that. We would make an adjustment there from when we know exactly what assets are moving out of the portfolio. And we're not ready to give you a number yet because we don't know exactly which of the mix of assets that we have on the market are actually going to achieve an acceptable price. We will give you some more indication of where that's heading hopefully in December but it's too early for us to do that now. And that's one of the reasons we really don't talk about the dispositions until they close. Because you can't know exactly which of the assets that are being considered for sale are actually achieving the price that they need to make it acceptable for us to sell them.","Edward Westlake","Okay and then so I can see how the production and cash flow moving parts move around with these sort of long-lived assets coming in which lower decline rates, plus obviously some short cycle production which you can attack both in conventional and also in Shale. But obviously reserve replacement is also something that people focus. I don't know if you've done any long range work as to if you're spending $8 billion at the low end as the CapEx drops out what reserve replacement looks like say 2017 onwards or what are the big sources that you can actually replace reserves at that point?","Matt Fox","We have this 44 billion barrel resource base that we've described in some length in April. The 18 billion of that has less than a $60 cost of supply, so there is lots of sources to continue to convert that resource base and the reserves as we go through the next few years. Is that the question you were getting at, Ed? So the point is that converting that resource base over time as we execute our capital programs is what's going to result in growth in the reserve base.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Maybe if I could talk a little bit about CapEx, the run rate in the third quarter of $2.2 billion, so annualized at an $8.8 billion run rate. How should we think about, maybe this is too much preview, but how should we think about moving pieces into 2016? Is that I mean it's meaningfully down from the first half of the year. Is that a reasonable run rate going forward? Is there still meaningful long cycle roll-off out of that number that will be cycled into short cycle or is much of that rolling off by this point? Anything on kind of the puts and takes as we look forward to the 3Q run rate?","Matt Fox","We still have capital going into major projects that will reduce significantly as we go into next year. So I think the easiest way to think about it Ryan is the $2 billion sort of number that we've been talking about in terms of the average capital going into major projects this year that's rolling off next year. So I wouldn't get too hung up on the run rate in the third quarter but more think about it as that sort of amount of major project capital rolling off from \u201815 to \u201816.","Ryan Todd","And then I guess a follow-up on a couple of questions ago in terms of the operating cost reductions. You've been well ahead of schedule with the $1 billion over two years turning into $1.5 billion effectively in one year. How much of that I mean if you think of that $1.5 billion, I mean how much of that is kind of structural versus cyclical? And as you look forward into 2016 I guess on the cyclical portion, do you have any thoughts on which way it cycles and is there more downside to that number going forward?","Jeff Sheets","Well, the cyclical part of it is driven primarily by foreign exchange and just deflation that we've seen in the industry. So to answer your question you've got to answer that in the context of our price level. So if we continue to have weak prices that's not going to cycle up in a period of weak prices. We probably have a period of weak prices, it may also mean that we continue to have a fairly strong U.S. dollar. So I don't know where you'd draw the line between cyclical and structural but if you're thinking about near-term if you think in terms of a continued weak price environment we don't really expect those to cycle back. But just in the overall general context like we've talked before we see about half of what's happened is kind of macro factors like deflation and FX and generally half has things that we're doing within the way we operate the business which are kind of more structural in nature.","Ryan Todd","And do you think there is more I guess on the non-cyclical side is there do you view there as being more to go still in 2016? Or have you pulled forward the line share of what you thought you'd be able to achieve?","Matt Fox","We've pulled forward a lot of it but there's still more to come. And we're going to give you the details in December on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the top of the hour. It's a philosophical question more on total returns. And I know you guys have made significant CapEx cuts outpacing deflation. Yet combined with asset sales do you view a risk or how do you balance a risk to a negative medium or longer term production growth, so that I mean I guess the risk is that dividend yield merges with total shareholder return type of metric in the future?","Jeff Sheets","I'm not sure if I followed your question Evan. If you think about in the near term we are going to benefit from capital that we've been investing over the last several years so that we are going to continue to have production growth from these major projects that will provide cash flow growth as well. If you do think about a longer-term lower price environment then you're in the realm of trying to anticipate what might happen with overall operating costs in the industry.","Matt Fox","And then from the asset sales perspective, we're not intending to sell assets that have growing production and cash flow.","Evan Calio","I guess the question and I will leave it there, so it relates to you're making significant cuts and the cuts are driven partially with the commitment to the dividend and at what point are you cutting muscle? I know you run a lot of different scenarios and I believe the security of the dividend at most prices but what's the cost as it relates to those sales in regard to the longer term outlook of either growth or asset value? I'll leave it at that.","Jeff Sheets","I think it gets back to a comment that we had earlier about what motivates a lot of the asset sales. A lot of the asset sales are driven by normal portfolio rationalization. Of course, we generate asset sales proceeds from that but if you look back, if you look at what we're selling now, if you look back at what we've historically sold I think you can understand why we would think of those nonstrategic assets which we got better value for by selling them than we would have had by keeping them inside the portfolio and that's the main driver for asset sales.","As you think about things like the deepwater decision, that's driven as much by the opportunity that we see in the rest of our portfolio as it is by thinking about just deepwater on its own. The resource base that we feel like we have and what are we going to want to prioritize in terms of funding capital is what's been a big driver for that decision.","Evan Calio","Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Jeff Sheets","We don't feel like we're doing things in this environment, which are going to not be beneficial to the long term ability to grow production and grow cash flows and grow the dividend.","Evan Calio","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks again for sneaking me in, just a quick one here, obviously going back to APLNG I see that the ramp gas is coming up nicely. I also notice that the equity gas realizations in Asia-Pacific are dropping. I'm assuming that's because the ramp gas is getting sold at domestic gas prices. Can you quantify at all if possible and you could just maybe use a Q3 constant pricing for this, but what the uplift would be if that ramp gas is being sold as LNG under your contracts?","Matt Fox","I don't have that off the top of my head, James. You're right the ramp gas as we're building up to fill Train 1 is getting sold at domestic prices essentially. And then the netback once we get to LNG will clearly be a function of what the oil price is really at that time because these are linked to JCC. But I don't have that number at the top of my head.","Jeff Sheets","But generally you can think that the price we're receiving for Australian gas in the domestic gas market is not any stronger than what we get for what we sell into the North American gas market. So there's a pretty significant uplift even in the current market, in the current oil price market to move that to LNG.","James Sullivan","Because I guess it was just trying to see whether it was a lot lower or if there was a contractually lower rate or anything like that. But it sounds like it's maybe just about what you'd expect for domestic, one just quick last one there. Obviously, I saw that you guys got the go ahead up in Alaska for some of the NPR drilling. Can you guys give a little update there? I know Greater Mooses Tooth some of these are longer dated projects, but what the timeframe and potential impact for some of those projects are? And I will take it off-line after that.","Matt Fox","Yes so we announced that the first production from the NPR-A from the CD5 project started just a week or so ago, less than a week ago. We did get approval from the government for the permits that we need to develop the GMT1 prospect, so the first prospect inside the Greater Mooses Tooth unit. And we're working through the process of deciding the sanction of that project but that sanction decision hasn't been made yet.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to the company for closing comments.","Matt Fox","Okay, I'd just like to make a couple of closing comments. Because we all know this is a difficult time for the industry but we at ConocoPhillips we're focused on what we can control and that's our production, our capital and our operating cost. As we outlined today we're moving all those quickly in the right direction. But we're really not just focused on the short-term. When we look at what it's going to take to win in a more cyclical and volatile future we think it's a diverse low decline production base that gives us stable source of funding to sustain the dividend and we have that. We think you want a large low cost supply resource base that provides a balance of flexible short cycle investment options, so you can scale your growth to higher or lower prices but also has a lower risk long-term projects that can add to the low decline base and we have that in our portfolio. We also think you need a sustainable low cost structure to make sure your margins are resilient to lower prices and you saw today we're taking a lot of action to get there. We think you need a strong balance sheet so that you can withstand the low phases of the cycle and we have that. And then we think that you need to prioritize return of capital to the shareholders to get them a real return and to install capital discipline. And that's what we are doing. So I think that we have the portfolio, the strategy and the commitment to deliver all of the things that are required for a company in our industry to win in this more cyclical and volatile future. So thanks for your interest and your questions.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, everybody. And feel free to call back if you have any follow-up. Thank you.

My name is Paulette, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paulette, and thanks to our listeners for joining us today. Our speakers will be Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Matt Fox, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Ryan will deliver some brief remarks, and then today we're going to go straight to Q&A to make time for your questions.","Our cautionary statements is shown on page 2 of today's presentation materials. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refer to future estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this page and in our periodic SEC filings. And then finally, we'll refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today, and that's to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. We provided reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure in our press release this morning, and also on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Ellen, and welcome everyone to today's call. In a moment, I will recap our 2018 highlights, but before I do, I'll first want to put those results, and in fact our results of 2017 in context. We're on a path to manage this company for the business we're in, one that's mature, capital intensive and cyclical. We've embraced this view of the business with a value proposition that we believe should be the new order for E&P companies. ","Now what do we mean by the new order? We mean a value proposition that repeats our returns and doesn't change cycles up or down. The market has clearly spoken that it expects behaviors in this business to change and we've led the E&P industry in an approach that can, and we believe, will attract investors back to the sector. Our value proposition now more than two years old, is fundamentally structured to offer this. Over this period, we've driven our sustaining price lower and made our balance sheet stronger. We've simultaneously grown our resource base, while lowering its overall cost of supply. ","We've achieved competitive per share growth, not chasing absolutely growth and we returned a distinctive payout of cash flows to shareholders, kept our costs in check and generated among the most competitive financing returns in the business. We're encouraged that our value proposition is clearly resonating with the margin. For us the value proposition is a mindset and a commitment that began in late '16, worked in 2017 and worked again in 2018.","So with that, let me summarize our 2018 results on slide 4. Starting with the strategy column on the left, we held firm on our priorities. During this year, Brent prices touched $80, but also $50 a barrel. But our priorities didn't change and this consistent approach allowed us to generate a return on capital employed of 12.6%, that's nearly a 20% improvement over our ROCE, when Brent was $109 per barrel just a few years ago. We increased our dividend, we accelerated our debt reduction to achieve our $15 billion target 18 months ahead of plan, and we repurchased $3 billion of shares.","We've executed just over $6 billion of buyback since our program began in late 2016, with about $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Including our dividends and buybacks, we returned about 35% of our CFO to our owners. All this was funded organically from free cash flow. We have $5.3 billion of adjusted earnings, $12.3 billion of cash from operations and $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.","To review cash is an effective means to ensure that we can, can execute our consistent programs of our buybacks and CapEx through the cycles. Our financial position is very strong and we execute, exited 2018 A rated by all three major credit rating agencies. And we achieved a settlement agreement in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA to fully recover an arbitration award of about $2 billion, of which we recognized over $400 million in 2018. Operationally, I'm proud of the way our organization performed. We safely executed our capital program and achieved underlying production growth of 18% on a per-debt adjusted share basis. We got help and strong performance on our Lower 48 business and from project start-ups across our regions.","Finally, we made great progress on our continuing efforts to add to our low cost of supply resource base and optimize our asset portfolio. We completed the high- value asset acquisitions and achieved significant exploration success in Alaska. We progressed our Montney appraisal program in Canada and began exploring on our new Louisiana Austin Chalk play. Our portfolio high grading continued in 2018. We generated about $1.1 billion of disposition proceeds and we grew preliminary year-end reserves to $5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The total reserve replacement rate was 147% and our organic reserve replacement rate was 109%.","Our year-end resource base now contains roughly 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent with an average cost of supply of less than $30 a barrel. This is the fuel for our continued success in our approach to the business. So in summary 2018 was another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips . But again, 2018 is behind us. What matters now is what's next. And that's a great segue into 2019. So in December, we laid out an operating plan that we believe can and will sustain our success. It's a plan that's resilient to lower prices, while offering investors virtually uncapped upsides to higher prices. This is an intentional and sometimes overlooked aspect of how we've positioned ConocoPhillips. We play both ends of the field, offense and defense.","Our 2019 operating plan is summarized on the next slide. You'll see in the upper right that we're sticking with the core elements on our value proposition; discipline, our focus on free cash flow generation, investing to grow cash flows and distinctive returns to shareholders. We've already announced the 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, plant production growth of 5% to 10% on a per-debt adjusted share basis and buybacks $3 billion for the third year in a row. This is consistent with our dollar-cost average approach to repurchases. Our 2019 capital plans had good activity and some potentially impactful operating milestones, several of which are shown on this page.","I'll make a quick tour of the items starting with Alaska. In 2019, we will advance construction at GMT-2 and conduct another season of exploration and appraisal drilling. In December, even before our ice road campaign began, we drilled two exploration wells from existing pads. Our Montney 14-well pad program is in full swing in Canada. And in the Lower 48 Big 3, we expect to grow production by about 19%. We're focusing our activities in the early part of the year on testing potential resource enhancing programs such as multi-well pilots of our Vintage 5 completion techniques, EOR pilots and refracs.","Given these activities, we expect volumes in the Big 3 to be relatively flat in the first half and ramped in the second half of the year. In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we've already started our four-well exploration program and I expect to have results later this year. And we expect to advance discussions and decisions on a few major projects in Asia, including Bohai Phase IV in China and the North Field expansion in Qatar and Barrosa in Australia. Guidance on this page represent opportunities to have low cost to supply resource, strength in our portfolio and create optionality for the future. ","Importantly, as we see results from these opportunities, we will retain flexibility on how and when we invest in most of these projects. You should expect us to prioritize and phase these investments in a way that it's aligned with our value proposition. As the year plays out, we will update you on our results across each of these fronts, and we anticipate providing a comprehensive, multi-year update to the market in November. We're excited to get another year out of the way. We believe our 2019 operating plan reflects what you've come to expect from us. It's consistent with our priorities focused on growing long-term value and underpinned by our commitment to strong execution. This is our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycles, and for many years. It's a formula we believe works and we're sticking to it.","So with that, let me turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hi guys, good morning. ","Ryan Lance","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Ryan, just curious that it seems like that you still have running room in Eagle Ford and probably, I knew it would less than in Bakken I presume. Based on what you see today on the business, I don't know whether, you can actually, you are saying that, oh, this is what I planned. Is the plateau one way going to be on those two basins? And once you get there and how fast you can get there, and once you get there, what kind of rig program you need to sustain in and how long that you can sustain at that peak production? And second question is real short one whether you receive any payment from APLNG?","Ryan Lance","Yes, let me, I think Matt could probably a little bit of color. Paul and Don can cover the APLNG question as well. But I would just say at a high level, we continue to find new technologies and new approaches. We talked a little bit about testing our Vintage 5 completions in the Eagle Ford. And what we see is continuing lowering cost of supply and opportunities to continue to grow that opportunity. And in fact Bakken had an outstanding year into 2018. We reached some plateau and suggested that to the marketplace and we outperformed in 2018 and we see some similar opportunities there as we go forward. Matt can maybe provide a little bit extra color for you there.","Matt Fox","Yes. Paul, we were running six rigs in the Eagle Ford just now. We actually dropped a rig at the beginning of the year in Eagle Ford to optimize the ratio of our rigs to completion crews. And we're running three in the Bakken and two in the Permian. They, those are sort of rig levels we would be at continuing to grow in the Eagle Ford. But if we run those rigs continuously, we'd ultimately reach a plateau and we'd be able to hold that plateau for well over a decade, maybe two decades. In the Bakken we, as Ryan said, we thought we were at plateau, but we've had some improved results from our drilling and completions there and we had more partner-operated activity. And so, we're now at higher rate than we anticipated and that can probably be sustained close to that rate for a decade and more. And then of course, in the Permian, we're very early in the life cycle there, so that's several years of growth ahead of it before it reaches a plateau.","Paul Cheng","Matt, do you have a number you might add on in Eagle Ford that where is the plateau maybe for you guys? And also that if you guys don't mind give me the production number for the Big 3 in the quarter?","Matt Fox","Yes, we, no, we don't have a number that we're ready to share on the plateau rig because as a function, the number of rigs that we run over the long term. So that will be, what we are trying to do, of course in all of these place is optimize the rig count, so that we optimize the infrastructure costs. And this is all of them maximizing the NPV as we learn more about, of our new completion designs. For example in Eagle Ford that may change how we view that. So it's premature to go there. In terms of the rates for the Big 3 in the fourth quarter, yes, I can give you the list, we, I don't have them off top my head here just now, we can get those for you.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Paul, I'll come back to in a moment. Ryan want to answer the...?","Ryan Lance","Yes. Paul, with respect to APLNG payments, I'm sure you're referring to the distribution. So in 2018, we had total of $480 million of distributions from APLNG and you'll recall, we had $200 million in the first half. I believe that I had probably guided that the second half would look similar to the first half and we ended up with a larger dividend distribution payment in the fourth quarter of $280 million, and that's really a reflection of a number of things, but probably mostly the high realizations, the LNG prices on a three months lag. So fourth quarter LNG pricing or realizations really reflect third quarter oil prices.","So really good revenues at APLNG and of course, they've made good progress on reducing costs, both on the operating side and on refinancing opportunities on the project financing. While I'm here, I know that you'll be curious about expectations for 2019 looking forward, and I would say that you've got to pick a price point because it is going to be very much influenced by actual realizations during the year, of course. But if they around say $65 a Brent then I'd probably expect distributions to be in the $500 million to $550 million range.","Matt Fox","And Paul, I have the fourth quarter average rates for the Big 3. It was 200 and the Eagle Ford, 101 in the Bakken and 34 in the Permian.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","Hi, everybody. Congratulations on your results.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Doug.","Matt Fox","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Terreson","I have a financial, and a strategic question today. First, return on capital appears to be rising even after normalizing for changes in oil and gas prices, especially in the U.S. business. And on this point, I want to see if you guys could provide some color on the drivers of this dynamic, meaning, is it gains and capital efficiency, the technology, is it costs or is it something else driving these improvements? So just some color on this improvement in this area.","Don Wallette","Well, Doug, this is Don. I would say yes, it's all of the above. If you look at the transformation that we've undergone in the last two to three years, certainly more capital efficient, more disciplined, a greater focus on returns and less of the priority now, of course. And so, you can go back to a lot of the portfolio changes that we've done to lower our cost of supply and our sustaining price. I think all of these things, reducing the debt and our operating costs, I think we're from like $10 billion to $6 billion, taking capital down from $17 billion I believe, in 2014 down to the current level around $6 billion. It's just efficiency on all fronts.","Doug Terreson","Okay. And then also strategically, Ryan, you reiterated your pledge to your new order value proposition, which has obviously served shareholders and that COP has been the best stock in S&P Energy since you've implemented the plan two years ago. Simultaneously, companies with past success in this industry often mission drift and that often results in strategic activity. So while most E&P acquisitions were done at about half of a quarter or capital cost over the past couple of years and were therefore doing pretty negatively in the market, valuations have fallen further and I wanted to see how you guys were thinking about strategic activity these days and if there are areas of interest, why and what are they?","Ryan Lance","Yes, Doug, we do get quite a lot of questions. I appreciate, it gives us a chance sort of articulate our views a little bit about the M&A side. Really for us, it's about strategic portfolio of choices and we've been pretty deliberate in that space over the last couple of years and since the spin of the company, it's also been on the disposition side with $30 billion and I would also remind everybody half of that went to the shareholders and half went to reduce the debt on the balance sheet. But we have been involved in some more strategic and smaller-scale acquisitions like adding acreage opportunities in the Montney and the Austin Chalk and where we think we have a clear competitive advantage like the asset deals we did last year up in Alaska. ","So when we think about that, we consider our asset quality diversity, resource debt and operating cost. So we think about do we add in, and adding those four categories around the portfolio, but our portfolio is in pretty good shape, 16 billion barrels of low cost high resource base that's Brent weighted. It's diverse, it's deep, it's material. So we are not feeling any pressure to do anything. It just has to be value-adding and substitutive in the portfolio. That's kind of where we stand out in the company.","Now broadly within the sector, consolidation should result in more disciplined capital allocation, slower growth and ultimately strengthening oil prices and help investors back into our sectors. When you consider, I think that on a sector basis, you have to consider things like the value that you pointed out, synergies, the timing, the market reaction to it. And what we find it's tough on a valuation perspective. If you are going to implement a disciplined capital allocation program like we have in place, you really need to slow down the growth rate for any acquisition target that you look at, but that growth rate is built into their valuation and then you usually have to pay us a premium on top of it. That makes it extremely difficult.","Synergies, tough to realize with some of the pure plays than the private equity companies that are out there. They just, unless you have adjacent acreage and infrastructure, there's just typically not many synergies. Timing is tough at the low point of the cycle, Board rooms are reluctant to sell and obviously tough to issue shares, to go to do something. And then you touched on as well, what's the market reaction? It has not been good. So people have been punished because they seem to be overpaid. So, we pay attention to it, in which we, we looked at it, we watch it, we see all the opportunities, got to be competitive in the portfolio. We understand what we like and what might fit, but it takes a real special deal to where we feel like it's a good use of a shareholder capital.","Doug Terreson","Thanks for the comprehensive answer, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Hi. Good morning. First question, I guess would be for Don. You're at your $15 billion gross debt target, but you have over $6 billion of cash, so your net debt is now below $9 billion. Wondering how you're thinking about that today in terms of willingness to take the gross debt down more or, obviously, it provides you a lot of flexibility in a downside price case, but in an upside price case, you'd be building even more cash. So how are you thinking about what you want to do with that?","Don Wallette","Yes. I think Phil, we're still at the same place we were as far as capital structure of the company and as far as gross debt. So, we're really not contemplating anything to further reduce the balance sheet debt. I think this is more of a cash utilization-type question and the reasons why we would maintain levels of cash, high levels of cash in a positive price environment, and that's going to speak to a number of things. But obviously, being able to withstand volatile price cycles and being able to run the steady programs and keep our strategy on pace on all fronts as far as buybacks, as far as the base capital program and so forth, gives us the opportunity to take advantage of strategic opportunities, investments that come around that are kind of one-time deals and maybe the potential Qatar expansion is part of that. So it can help kind of refund some of those potential opportunities going forward.","Ryan Lance","Yes, I'd say, so Phil, it's not burning a hole in our pocket and remind everybody less than a month ago, people were panicking with $40 crude prices. So we're not doing that, we're staying with our program as Don said, with, that allows the consistency through the cycles on both the buybacks and the capital invested and follow our priorities.","Phil Gresh","Yes. That makes lot of sense. And I guess, the follow-up is to your, to your last comment there, Don. I feel like one of the most frequently asked questions, I've been getting about ConocoPhillips is the level of capital spending there might be moving forward. You could include Qatar in there, you could include Barossa or a well or so. How do you guys think about the levels of capital spending that might be needed moving forward? I realize you're not going to have an Analyst Day for a while, but any color you might be able to give I think it would be helpful.","Ryan Lance","Yes, Phil. Let me, let take that one on. I know we've gotten a fair number of questions about them. I appreciate you asking about it. Yes, we're probably not going to provide the clarity that you may want in terms of absolute numbers going forward, we will update the market if some of this resolves, but I think we've been pretty transparent about the opportunities you mentioned in the new field, in the North Field expansion in Qatar. So we tried to show those beyond your base programs. I just reviewed in my prepared remarks some of the higher impact activities we have under way in 2019. ","Now we expect to resolve a lot of the uncertainties and most of it, if not all of those projects as we go through the course of the year. Then we'll take stock of what and when and how we might invest in those opportunities. But I'd tell you I think from our past activity and reputation, we've been intentional about retaining flexibility in many of the projects and we really have the discussion to face the capital investments over time. I think we've also had a pretty successful track record of disbursing assets that don't compete in the portfolio, they are high graded. And that provides another means of flexibility as well.","So our goal really is to create the highest returns to our shareholders, while preserving our higher proposition that we're committed to including a focus on free cash flow. So that means we'll be setting and be thoughtful about setting our future plans according to those kinds of premises. So, and then again, we'll lay that out in a lot more detail are you later in November. We're not going to lose our way by ourselves.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Q - Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Ryan, you guys have set the bar pretty high for the industry in terms of capital discipline. So I think questions that are on the longer-term CapEx are obviously relevant, but I think in the confines of how you've allocated capital, I am curious however, if you see a kind of upside limit on the level of reinvestment as a percentage of cash flow to kind of put it simplistically. I realize you might talk about this a bit more in November, but when you look at the list of opportunities, if you did get Qatar or Barossa or Bohai sanction this year, would your aim be to hold the CapEx within a range or this is the upside versus the longer-term CapEx?","Ryan Lance","Well, again as I was trying to say we'll see where the commodity price for the market is at. I think first and foremost, we're committed to giving a high percentage of our cash flow back to the shareholders. So we start by as you've all sort of noticed that 30% is kind of our forward. We're committed to giving 30% of the cash back to the shareholders. So we will fund the company and will allocate capital to the programs with the remaining amount of cash that we have in the business. But we're going to look at it annually and make sure that we still continue to deliver free cash flow from the business. ","And as we think about the opportunities that you mentioned, the North Field expansion, Barossa, and somehow we will manage that. We've got control over pace, we've got control over timing, we've got control over what our interest level is, and we've got other ways to control the capital program, and we'll do that. And we'll take that into account as we did. We've got a rich set of opportunities coming our way, and we've got capacity and we've got cash on the balance sheet, but we also know any given year, we're committed to our value proposition and we're going to stay the course.","Q - Doug Leggate","Perhaps just a quick follow-up to that, Ryan. There has been some speculation in the press that you were pursuing our North Sea sale and that sale may have, not be going forward. Now I wonder if you could offer any color on, on just that specific issue, but also the general portfolio management in terms of non-core assets as they stand today, because I'm guessing that would also factor into the flywheel for your ability to return cash and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Ryan Lance","Yes, you bet Doug. I think Matt's been kind of managing that, the UK process for us. I'll let him kind of provide a little bit of color on that for you.","Matt Fox","Yes, Doug, we, our process to market with UK assets continues. But we are no longer on an exclusive arrangement to do that. So we've brought in the process to include several parties and that really has very strong interest in properties. I don't want to comment any further on that, unless there's a material change to report, then we'll turn the line. But we are actively marketing those assets. And in terms of other assets that we might market, we've expressed consistently, and consistently executed on the fact that we will look at the lower end of the portfolio and dispose of assets as they, as the, from the timing is right. We did $1.1 billion this year. And so you should expect to see is continue to work on the assets now.","We'd say that the major portfolio restructuring is essentially behind us. But that's not to say that there aren't other changes that we've made to the portfolio. And just to be clear, I think you maybe said the North Sea assets. The assets that we are marketing are the UK assets. So I think that's the best way to describe what the state of players are on the disposition front.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin","Hi, I've got a question on reserve replacement in the U.S.. You had asset sales this year, you've changed the way you allocate capital, reserves declined. What should we think about in terms of your reserve replacement in the U.S. on kind of a going-forward basis, just low nominal growth?","Matt Fox","Yes. So, we'll start by explaining what happens to their overall reserve base there. There's a slide in the appendix that we had, that we posted I think in slide 9, that describes the overall sources of reserve replacement. So we started the year with $5.38 billion and ended with $5.263 billion, that's a lot of decimal places. We produced 483 million barrels. We added 474 million through extensions and discoveries and another 52 million and, through revisions and improved recovery.","So that's where we get to the 109% organic reserve replacement ratio that Ryan mentioned. And then if you look at the acquisitions and dispositions, the net effect of that was 182 million barrels. We added close to 300 million in Alaska through the acquisitions and that was offset by $38 million reduction in the clear disposition and $68 million from Lower 48. So we feel all that together the net effect is we get 147 million, 147% total reserves replacement.","John Herrlin","No, I got to the Lower 48, Matt.","Matt Fox","Yes, the Lower 48, I think the best way to think of that is to think about in the context of the resource base the, because the Lower 48, obviously the booking schedule there is based on SEC rules, is limited to what you're anticipating in your five-year drilling schedule. So when we look at the Eagle Ford, for example, we booked about 500 million barrels of the 2.5 billion barrels of central resource base. And if you look at the other place, we're about 50% booked in the Bakken, 20% in the Eagle Ford, less than 15% booked in the Permian and less than 1% booked in the Montney. So there's a long period ahead of us of continuing to add SEC reserves as we work through this resource base.","So the that we, what we tend to focus on frankly rather than the reserves is that resource base and then if you look at, if you look at that from, for this year, we went from 15 billion barrels last year with the cost of supply of less than $50 to 16 billion barrels this year with the cost of supply less than $40. So because we produced about 0.5 billion barrels, that's a resource replacement ratio of 300% and the, and that's what we are, that's what we are really focused on. And I think both from a reserves and a resource perspective, we're in really good shape and specifically to your question, we're in really good shape in the Lower 48 because of the way those reserves will be booked over time.","John Herrlin","Great, thanks Matt. My next one is regarding some of the larger projects that could be approved for FID, and I guess, this is more towards Ryan. Are you at all worried about E&C capacity in terms of delivery? I mean obviously, the industry doesn't have the frenzied activity that it did in past cycles, but are you at all concerned about the industry being able to deliver as you commit to these kinds of projects?","Ryan Lance","Not necessarily, John. I think when you look at the location you look at Barossa where, out for competitive bid on FPSOs and the market is pretty light right now in Asia-Pacific. So the opportunity itself is out there. Not too worried about that. The subsea equipment associated with that is highly competitive and not real stressed out in the system today. Qatar is going through, a large expansion in Qatar Ras Laffan. That will probably have its challenges. But I think they've managed it well in the past, and we'll expect them to manage it well going forward. So while it's always a risk, I think we've got the team in place, we've got the capability as a large company like we are and the functional excellence around managing these projects. We haven't lost that as a company. So we'll bring all that excellence to bear on all of these major projects going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","Ryan Lance","Good morning, Roger.","Don Wallette","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","Could you just maybe come back around one of the, and, Don, you talked about it a little bit, the decline in OpEx, the company has been able to achieve kind of broader productivity and efficiencies. Wrapping what you can do going forward on that front and maybe if you would, or if you can disclose the underlying decline rate, just kind of want to understand, maybe some of the more, I guess I'd describe as increasing challenges on being able to deliver continued improvement just from internal things as opposed to maybe some of these future projects that everybody has been more focused on, on the call?","Matt Fox","And maybe I'll take that one, Roger, this is Matt. If you look at our OpEx, we're still completely committed to the discipline and their OpEx. If you look at what's happening from last year to this year, for example, last year, operating costs, was $5.8 billion, but if you put on a pro forma basis and reflecting the acquisitions and dispositions most notably, they compare it and clear transactions, their OpEx would have been of $6 billion on a pro forma basis. This year we're moving to $6.1 billion, but when you look at the underlying production growth, our OpEx per barrel is going from $12.6, it is $12.6 rather and that's $0.20 less than last year. So the absolute numbers are a bit higher than 2018, but the unit cost is lower and that's pretty impressive when you consider that the acquisition in Alaska are relatively high cost barrels. Of course, they are very high value barrel because it's all oil in the sales of Brent.","And so the fact that we, that they, that we added those higher cost barrels and still see a reduction in operating cost per barrel, I mean it's the same that we've, we're certainly not, haven't lost the discipline on the cost front and we can see that, that focus is going to remain in the company from, over the next several years and we're going to continue to make sure that we're driving our unit costs down over time.","Roger Read","Yes. Thanks for that. That's actually very helpful. And anything on the underlying decline rate, I can't remember if you've talked about that or not, just wanted to ask.","Ryan Lance","The underlying decline rate on aggregate is about 10% [indiscernible]. Yes, that's unmitigated \u2013 without -- that takes all the wells that were online at the end of last year, and what would they be producing at the end of the next year. So of course, because we have the and production in LNG and oil sands, which is essentially zero decline, and a very large conventional base that has a modest decline, when we put together that with our unconventionals which of course, decline more quickly, the aggregate effect is about 10% decline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, good morning, and thanks again for the question, letting us ask question here. The first one for you is just on Venezuela. Obviously very fluid situation out there and just your thoughts on the ability to collect the capital that's owed to the company and just some thoughts on the ground of how that plays out from here.","Don Wallette","Yes, Neil, this is Don. I'll address that question. With respect to the recent events in Venezuela, we, a couple of things. I guess one on the Venezuela side and one on, with respect to the U.S. sanctions, the new U.S. sanctions. I mean as far as PDVSA, today they have fully complied with the settlement agreement that we entered into late last summer as far as making cash payments and providing the inventories that, what we were entitled to. We are in very regular contact with the officials at PDVSA and they continue to assure us that their intention is to continue to comply with the obligations under the settlement agreement. And I think that their actions over the past seven months or eight months have indicated that ConocoPhillips is currently high on their priority list of creditors.","So we expect that they will continue to comply. Of course, we don't know, nobody knows how things are going to change in the Venezuela and what that may entail. Their next, they're now on a quarterly payment schedule for the recovery of the ICC settlement and the next quarterly installment is due next month. And we expect to receive it and it appears that they're making plans to satisfy that obligation.","The other part of it is the, on the U.S. side, related to the U.S. government's recent actions and we are operating under a license from OFAC the Office of Foreign Assets Control that we obtained before we entered into the settlement agreement. We have been in contact with OFAC officials as recently as earlier this week and they have assured us that our license is valid, that we have, we are strictly complying with that license and they've given us very good guidance on how to go forward. They don't anticipate any issues related to our settlement agreement and so we don't see any complications on that front.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Don and then the follow-up question is, is just on Qatar LNG. The timing of that sounds like it's going to be mid 2019. We expect to get a decision about the project partners. How do you see ConocoPhillips position for potential project win there, any thoughts on the latest in terms of returns? And I guess one of the market concerns around Qatar LNG has been around financing the capital spend. It strikes us that you guys have a substantial amount of free cash flow coming up over the next couple of years that shall lame market concerns, even after the dividend and the buyback. But any comments about how you think about financing that capital outlay if the project materializes would be great.","Matt Fox","Yes, Neil. I'll take that one. The timeline is just as you laid out. We expect decisions to be made by the middle of this year. And the underlying process to achieve that is sort of under way. We think we're very well positioned competitively to participate in the project. And in terms of financing it, we have cash available to finance it, we have a very high free cash flows, I mean, we're recognizing even this year, we generate free cash flow, any price above $40 a barrel WTI. And so we're not concerned about our ability to finance that. So we are bring, we're fully engaged in the process with Qatar Petroleum and we'll see how that plays out as we go through the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Good morning folks. Matt, on that last point, could you just remind me when if you did go forward with Qatar, when we could expect first production roughly?","Matt Fox","I think the timeline would be first production between 2024 and 2025, it is when the expectations are. Engineering design is already under way and it is not being slowed down for they are waiting for the final participants to be agreed. So it will be the, sometime late '24 or early '25 is when we expect that to come to market.","Blake Fernandez","That's great. Thank you. The second question, I suspect you guys aren't as exposed to this. But the feedback we're getting from our E&P team that's covering some of the smaller companies in the space and maybe some of the privates, we're looking at CapEx budgets being ratcheted back and rig count potentially coming down and all of a sudden now we are hearing commentary regarding potential cost deflation in the Lower 48. I know it's early days in the '19 but I just didn't know if you're beginning to witness anything or if you think there's potentially some downward pressure on spending based on kind of peers cutting, cutting activity levels.","Matt Fox","Yes, I think last year we saw about $100 million of escalation in the Lower 48 and, but we are seeing some, we had some deflationary pressures. For example, the, in the frac fleet, activity in the low 40s than about 10% just in the last couple of months. So our view is that the frac fleet is about 65% utilization just now. And if you put that together with the big reductions in sand prices because of new main sites opening, we are actually seeing quite a healthy reduction on our completion costs from '18 to '19 and we've built that into our budget. Those were contracts that we renewed toward the end of the year. So yes, we are seeing some cost reductions on completions. On the high spec rig, on the rig side of it, we're, higher utilization, about 92% on rigs. And we have options on our rigs through the end of 2019. So I think that, yes, there could be some deflation going to show open in 2019 and we already saw some of that showing up toward the end of '18.","Blake Fernandez","That's great, I appreciate the color, Matt. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. I had a couple of quick ones. First, you all have somewhere around $7 billion of cash right now, and obviously positioned well to generate more free cash flow. But considering the opportunities that you have in front of you that was discussed quite a bit today, and obviously, our buyback program that's in force right now as well, is there an optimal amount of cash you guys would like to have as a cushion? And so where I'm going with this is, if a number of these large projects do come to fruition, is there a chance you guys can look at saying adding debt to the portfolio to help fund those projects or is that where you come back and say, that's where you look at monetization opportunities and other things?","Matt Fox","Scott, yes, I think we've been pretty clear that we're not looking to either raise or lower debt from its current level and I don't know if there's an optimal, there is not an optimal point of cash balance that we're aiming for on the balance sheet. There, it's a pretty wide range given the volatile business that we're in and the host of opportunities that we hope to have that are investable in the future. So, now there's really not, there's not an optimal level of cash.","Don Wallette","I think I would add them Scott, that you again follow our priorities. We feel comfortable with the capital that we're investing right now. We'll grow the company, grow margins, grow cash flows for the company we, at the kind of level that we're funding today. Given where the portfolio stands, we're going to fully fund our $3 billion of share repurchases. And above that, to the extent we have additional cash there, we're okay putting it on the balance sheet for now, because we see opportunities that might present themselves in a down market. And also we ask ourselves what the future holds for us, what our commodity price is going to do and that gives us a level of comfort when we have that cash on the balance sheet to know that we can fund the opportunities that we have and we can stand the downturns in receivables.","Scott Hanold","Okay appreciate, understood. And as a follow-up. Touching based on sort of the Big 3 unconventionals in the Lower 48, is there an appetite to look at some point to put those more on, hey, we've hit the plateau and they're going to be more on maintenance more. Are we near that point for those say, the Eagle Ford and Bakken or are you still kind of building up to that? And then as you look at the Permian Basin, with your position in the Delaware, what do you see as sort of the optimal kind of pace that you guys can develop that at?","Matt Fox","So I would say Scott, in the Bakken, we were essentially at plateau. I mean [indiscernible]. That is not our ambition to grow Bakken further. We can sustain level around where we are just now for a long time. But we don't, we're used in running two or three rigs and we're comfortable with that in the Bakken. In the Eagle Ford, we're still growing. This year, we're running six rigs and we'll continue to see growth from that and we are, as Ryan said, testing some new technology in the completion designs there, what we called Vintage 5. Once we understand how those new completion design works, we might revisit what the right piece and moderate plateau we have and so on, but there's a few more years of growth for sure left in the Eagle Ford before we get to plateau.","And then the Permian is a long way from plateau. We're running two rigs. just, maybe you remember last year, but we took a rig out of the Permian as the differentials blew out. I suspect something over the next year or two, we'll put that, the third rig back to work again there. And but the, and that will continue to grow for several years before we reach its plateau. You are asking the good fundamental question here for the industry as a whole is, is how do we, how does the industry think about where the optimum plateau is. ","And the optimum plateau is certainly not just a year or two, you know you're overbuilding infrastructure if you go there and then the optimum plateau isn\u2019t several years because your time, value or money. Certainly, we think of this very carefully as we consider the rig, the pace of rig activity and the piece of infrastructure build and the pace of technology change. So I think we have a good handle on how we should be managing these assets to optimize the value from a plateau perspective and rig count perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey LeBlanc from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey LeBlanc","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one's on the upsides for the Lower 48. I was just hoping you could talk a bit more about Vintage 5 testing that you've mentioned a few times now that's going on in the Eagle Ford in terms of both variables that you may be tweaking and then also just a timeline for when we may see some data around at all. And then in the Permian, specifically was hoping you could talk a bit about capital allocation within an asset for you all, just toward getting a sense of operational objectives there in the near term?","Matt Fox","Yes, I mean the Vintage 5, basically what they are, we have the sayings to intensify the stimulative drop volume to improve recovery factor, that's the essence behind the Vintage 5, it's the same. We haven't really disclosed that, it's the same, but that's the underlying parameter that we're trying to improve as the recovery factor and improving the intensity and regularity of the stimulative drop volume. So we completed the single well pilot last year and we got really encouraging results there. So what we're doing now is we're going to do three multi-well pilots at different locations and at different spacings within Eagle Ford in 2019. And then two more we have planned for 2020.","So we'll get initial results from that late this year and then more results into 2020. We are also advancing the multi-well pilot Vintage 5 test in the Delaware too, that will be later this year. So results there won't come until 2020. So the, and it's a very interesting technology angle to be pursuing here and we're looking forward to seeing those results. In terms of the Permian capital allocation specifically, really it is driven, of course, by the rig count and two this year and then sometime over the next year or two growing to, growing to three rigs.","Jeffrey LeBlanc","Great and then my second one is on acquisitions and maybe this is a bit nuance and maybe impossibly rounding air, but you saw in the disclosure with earnings today $0.6 billion for acquisitions for the year last year, which compares $0.5 billion for Q3 earnings. I know that as a bolt-on, the Alaskan Montney has been listed pretty consistently throughout the year. So just wondering if there is any color you can give there on the nature of that incremental $100 million or so that might be implied just for Q4's activity?","Matt Fox","Yes. So the acquisition in the Western North Slope is $400 million and Montney acquisition was $120 million. The balance of that is really some additional smaller acquisitions to core up in places like the Louisiana Austin Chalk. So it is, this way, I can't point to one big one that makes up the difference there. It's several smaller-scale acquisitions and the portfolio that takes us to the $600 million.","Jeffrey LeBlanc","I appreciate it.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks. Paulette, we're getting close to the top of the hour. So we'll take our last question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Appreciate the time. And I guess you kind of alluded to one in the last question, but I was curious, in the context of, of kind of the Vintage 5 completions in the Eagle Ford. I mean if you look at your prior disclosures, you had pretty big step changes along the way as you've moved up the Vintage cycle, I guess. Do you still see that sort of potential rate of change, I guess, as you move from Vintage 4 to Vintage 5 to or is this something that's more on the margin. And then, where would you say you're at in terms of Vintaging in the other place like the Willow has done in Permian?","Matt Fox","So Vintage 5 really isn't focused on trying to improve IP. It's really focused on trying to improve recovery factor. So they, the big increases in commercial production that we've disclosed from Vintage 1 through Vintage 4 is really not what we are targeting here. This is a more fundamental improvement in the EUR across any given dropped volume. So that's what Vintage 5 is about. That's why it's going to take several months after these wells were brought online to truly understand how the type curve is evolving and how interference with other wells is behaving. And so, it will have a different characteristic of improvement than Vintage 1 through Vintage 4. So far across the rest of our plays, Bakken, Permian and Montney, we're really implementing completion techniques similar to Vintage 4. Just now we're testing Vintage 5 in the Eagle Ford and a civil test in the Permian also. And we'll then, we're pretty good at transferring these learnings across the organization quickly, so we don't have to pilot test everything everywhere before we can put it to work in other plays.","Michael Hall","Great, that's super helpful. And I guess last one on my end would just be, just curious if you'd be willing to possibly provide exit rate thoughts for the Big 3 in aggregate or individually for 2019?","Matt Fox","Well, I mean I gave the exit rates earlier for the Big 3 individually for the, really for the fourth quarter average rates, which is really in my view, the best way to think about the above the exit rate because of the movement here. But what we, what we've said we're going to do in the, in 2019 is we're going to produce $350,000 on average through 2019. So that's about 20% growth from '18 and that's going to come through over the first quarter.","So, and I think Ryan mentioned this in his prepared remarks, the first half is going to be relatively flat. We had really great exceptional outperformance in 2018 as we went through the year. In particular toward the end of the year, we had, you know, how these programs work. You have, you are drilling multi-well pads, so you get lumpiness within each of the individual plays. Towards the end 2018 we had multi-well pads coming on essentially simultaneously across the Big 3. So we saw a big jump there and, so now we'll be moving toward more of a momentum and we will be experimenting with these, the Vintage 5 completions, which take a little bit longer to pump. So that's why we expect them to be flat through the first half of the year and then we'll jump up in the second half of the year as we increase the number of completions.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks. I think that's going to wrap it up to the day everybody. We really appreciate your interest, by all means call us back if you have any other follow ups. And thanks again for joining us. Paulette, that.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","C. C. Reasor","Great. Good morning. Welcome to ConocoPhillips' fourth quarter earnings conference call. We appreciate your interest in our company. I'm joined today by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President of Finance and our CFO. This morning, we'll provide a summary of our key financial and operating results for the fourth quarter, as well as our outlook for 2012. As in the past, you can find our presentation material on the Investor Relations section of ConocoPhillips' website. Please take a look at the Safe Harbor statement that we have on the bottom of this slide. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. And actual results may be materially different from what's presented today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. ","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Sheets to take you through our fourth quarter results. Jeff?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Thanks, Clayton. I'll start with an overview of our fourth quarter, which is on Slide 2. During the quarter, our earnings adjusted for special items were $2.7 billion or $2.02 a share. That's up from $1.9 billion or $1.32 a share in the fourth quarter of last year. Our annualized return on capital employed was 13%. We generated cash from operations of $5.8 billion, which is $4.39 per share. ","In E&P, our production of 1.6 million BOE per day was higher than the prior quarter and slightly above our expectations. In R&M, our global refining capacity utilization rate was 94%. We made significant progress on our asset disposition program with the sale of the Colonial, Seaway Crude and Seaway Products pipelines for $2.4 billion in proceeds during the quarter. Our repurchase of 46 million shares is quite a represented 3% of our shares outstanding, and we ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. ","So I'll turn to Slide 3 and talk about those earnings in more detail. Reported earnings for the quarter were $3.4 billion, which included $723 million of special items. Special items included $1.5 billion in net gains from asset sales, largely resulting from the pipeline dispositions I just mentioned. We also had $649 million of impairments. The large impairments included $395 million related to our investment in the Naryanmarneftegaz joint venture in Russia and $190 million for certain conventional and natural gas properties in Canada. Other special items in Q4 included $101 million in settlement and other costs related to the Bohai Bay incident and $25 million related to our repositioning efforts. So taking these special items into account, adjusted earnings were $2.7 billion, which is about $750 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Our E&P segment improved by around $500 million, primarily due to stronger crude oil and LNG prices, offset by higher taxes. R&M's fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million were basically unchanged from a year ago. And combined, our other segments contributed about $250 million to the increase in earnings this quarter, and we'll go through more detail on that on some subsequent slides. ","So let's go to Slide 4 and look at our 2011 full year earnings. So full year 2011 adjusted earnings were $12 billion, which were more than $3 billion improved from 2010. All of our business segments generated better financial results in 2011 than in 2010. So excluding the LUKOIL segment, for which we stopped recording equity earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 and which had $1.25 billion of earnings in Q4 '10, our adjusted earnings increased by $4.6 billion from 2010 to 2011. ","So next, we'll go through some detail on our segment earnings and we'll start with the production levels in our Upstream business which are highlighted on Slide 5. Fourth quarter production was 1.6 million BOE per day. That's down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. If you exclude the impact of dispositions and the suspension of our operations in China and Libya, production was down 1% over this time period. Asset dispositions reduced production by about 30,000 BOE per day. 14 or so of that was from North America natural gas production. In Libya, production was down 43,000 BOE per day compared to the same period last year. Production in Libya started again in late November and continues to ramp up and current production levels are around 20,000 BOE per day. In Russia, we continue to have difficulties with the reservoir in the YK field, and our production was down 23,000 BOE per day in that area. In Bohai Bay, our production was 38,000 BOE per day, lower than a year ago. ConocoPhillips continued the depressurization plan for the field and continues to work with our co-venture and regulatory agencies related to Bohai Bay. So excluding these items I just discussed, increases in production from exploitation drilling, well performance and production from major projects offset decreases associated with decline and downtime. ","So some things going to -- compared to the same period of last year, fourth quarter production highlights included a 44,000 BOE per day increase in production from our Lower 48 liquids-rich shale plays, the Eagle Ford and the Barnett; 32,000 BOE per day increase from Qatargas 3 project; and a 13,000 BOE per day increase associated with new wells at our SCCL joint venture from the Christina Lake Phase C ramp-up. ","So we'll see similar drivers when we look at our full year production numbers on Slide 6. For the full year 2011, production was 1.62 million BOE per day, which was down 8% from 2010. Excluding the impacts of dispositions in Libya and China, production was down 2% or about 30,000 BOE per day. Asset dispositions for the year reduced production by 48,000 BOE per day, 17,000 of which was North America natural gas of production. Libya production was down 39,000 BOE per day and production out of Russia was down 23,000 BOE per day, compared to the same period last year. And the full year impact of reduced production at Bohai Bay was 15,000 BOE per day. Like the fourth quarter numbers, 2011 project and drilling performance highlights included significant increases at QG3 and in our North American unconventional plays. And these increases largely offset declines in the rest of our portfolio. ","So now I'll turn to E&P earnings, which is on Slide 7. Adjusted E&P earnings for the quarter were $2.3 billion. This is 27% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher crude and NGL prices and these prices drove both our U.S. and our international adjusted earnings higher. Our earnings in the fourth quarter reflected a $3.50 Henry Hub natural gas price. In addition to price impact, lower DD&A and favorable FX impacts increased earnings this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings were negatively impacted this quarter versus a year ago by lower sales volumes and higher costs. Costs were higher primarily due to the U.K. tax law change and the fact that the QG3 project was fully online. ","So next, I'll move to Slide 8 and talk about some of our E&P unit metrics. Our cash and income per BOE metrics were better than a year ago and better than the third quarter. For the year, income per BOE was $15.72, which has improved over $10.56 in 2010. Full year cash margins increased from $23.22 to $27.46 in 2011. Now this improvement largely reflects the increase in commodity prices, but there's also a small margin enhancement related to changes in our production mix, and we'll continue to focus on improving margins by shifting our portfolio to a higher margin production as we go forward. ","So next, let's look at R&M earnings on Slide 9. R&M adjusted earnings of $200 million were basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So R&M are offsetting impacts earnings this quarter. Refining margins were lower and that was offset by lower cost and higher volumes and higher marketing margins. And with the exception of the Mid-Continent area, the Refining & Marketing environment in the  fourth quarter was generally worse than the refining market we saw in the fourth quarter 2010. This quarter, our refining margins benefited by approximately $180 million, related to the impact of liquidating inventory associated with the portfolio changes we made during 2011. As compared to the fourth quarter 2010, our volumes were benefit to earnings as global utilization rates were 94%. And costs related to turnarounds were $90 million pretax during the fourth quarter, which is $117 million less than the same period a year earlier and utility costs were also lower primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices. ","So if you look at the full year 2011, R&M generated $2.6 billion in adjusted earnings and $4.1 billion in operating cash flow. ","So we look at the R&M unit metrics on Slide 10, the per barrel metrics for Refining & Marketing were similar to a year ago and down significantly from the third quarter this year. The fourth quarter income per BOE was $0.70 and the cash contribution was $1.50. For the year, income margins of $2.29 per BOE were improved over 2011 margins of $1.10 per BOE. We continue to look for ways to improve our margins through processing more advantaged crudes and increasing our clean product yield. An example of this is the Wood River refinery, where at current market prices, we expect about a $4 per barrel uplift in Wood River's margins as a result of the CORE project startup in November of this year. ","We'll take a look at the results of our other operating segments on Slide 11. Adjusted earnings increased in both our Chemicals and our Midstream segments. Chemicals earnings of $156 million improved primarily as a result of higher volumes from international projects. 2011 earnings in this segment were $745 million, up from $498 million in 2010. Midstream earnings increased $27 million up to $118 million in 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting improvements in NGL prices. 2011 Midstream earnings for the year were $458 million, up from $306 million in 2010. Adjusted Corporate expenses were $154 million this quarter. This was lower than what we expected due to favorable foreign exchange impacts, higher capitalized interest and lower interest expense. ","So now, we'll -- let's talk about cash flow on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, we generated $5.8 billion in cash from operations, which includes $1 billion decrease -- $1 billion due to a decrease in working capital. Also, during the quarter, we closed several asset dispositions resulting in proceeds of $2.7 billion. During the fourth quarter, we funded a $4 billion capital program, $3.5 billion of which was directed towards E&P. We also paid $4 billion in shareholder distributions, split between $3.1 billion in share repurchases and $900 million in dividends. This quarter, we also reduced debt by $527 million through the retirement of some notes that matured. And we ended the year with $5.8 billion in cash and $600 million in short-term investments. So that's looking at our fourth quarter cash flow. ","What we'll do on Slide 13 is look at our full year sources and uses of cash. So if you look at all of 2011, we generated $24 billion between cash from operations, asset disposition and the sale of our LUKOIL shares, and we reduced our cash and short-term investment position by $4 billion. The cash from operations number of $19.6 billion in 2011 was $2.6 billion higher than the cash from operations in 2010. So the cash from operations funded a capital program of $14 billion, as well as our dividend of $3.6 billion. Our asset dispositions of $4.8 billion in 2011 included $1.2 billion from our -- sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. And these proceeds, along with cash from our previous asset sales largely funded the $11 billion share repurchase program. And during the year, we also reduced debt by $969 million. ","So we'll turn to Slide 14 and look at our capital structure. At the end of 2011, our equity was down $3 billion compared to the end of 2010, largely as a result of our share repurchase program. Our debt balance was $22.6 billion, which was down $1 billion from the end of 2010. So that left our debt-to-capital ratio at 26% for the year. ","So next, we'll move to Slide 15 and talk about some capital efficiency metrics. 2011, return on capital employed is 14%, which is up from the 2010 ROCE number of 10%, and our cash returned in 2011 was 23% versus 20% in 2010. The year-over-year improvements in ROCE were primarily driven by increased improved liquids prices and stronger refining margins, as well as lower capital employed as a result of our share repurchase program. So looking at ROCEs on a segment level, E&P ROCE improved from 12% to 16%, while R&M ROCE improved from 5% to 13%. The Chemicals segment had a 2011 ROCE of 29%, which is up from 22% last year, and Midstream was 57% in 2011, up from 34% in 2010. ","So that completes the review of our fourth quarter 2011 results, and I'd like to next move and talk about and give you an update on our 2010 through 2012 repositioning efforts. So in late 2009, we laid out plans to reposition ConocoPhillips. We've made significant progress on these initiatives and plan to largely finish those in 2012. We've made changes to our portfolio in the past 2 years with $10.7 billion in asset sales and $9.5 billion of proceeds from our sale of our 20% interest in LUKOIL. Additionally, we have reduced refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels per day since the end of 2009. And we expect to continue an asset sales program of $5 billion to $10 billion during 2012. We continue to progress our plans to create 2 leading energy companies, and we updated the Phillips 66 Form 10 in January, and the distribution of the Phillips 66 shares and the completion of that transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2012, possibly as early as May. ","Another key part of our 3-year plan is enhancing returns. As I just discussed, our returns improved significantly over this time period, and we continue to focus our capital on higher-margin production to help drive margins and returns higher. We've also focused on improving our financial flexibility and we reduced debt by $6 billion over the last 2 years. The company's in good financial position today with a debt to cap of 26% and cash and short-term investments of $6 billion. And we've grown shareholder distributions with $15 billion in share repurchases in 2010 and 2011, with an additional $5 billion to $10 billion plan for 2012 as we continue to execute the asset sales program. And we remain committed to maintaining a competitive dividend that increases annually. ","So we've outlined our plans, and you can turn to Slide 17 and see some of the impact that, that has on our per-share metrics. If you look at Slide 17, you see our reserves per share increased 12% from 2010 to 2011, went from 5.7 BOE per share in 2010 to 6.4 BOE per share in 2011. And our production per share, when you adjust for the impact of the events in Libya, increased 5% from 2010 to 2011. And we expect that, that will increase this year by another 3% to 5%. ","So I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before we open up the line to questions. Some guidance for 2012, starting with our R&M business. We expect turnaround activity to be about $450 million pretax, with about 40% of that activity occurring in the first quarter 2012, and global refining capacity utilization is expected to be in the low 90s in 2012. In E&P, we expect 2012 production to be about 1.6 million BOE per day, excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. And the guidance we would give around the impact of additional asset sales is that could reduce production by 50,000 to 100,000 BOE per day, and this production guidance assumes that we have some restoration of our production in Libya and Bohai Bay. ","As we announced earlier this week, we had 2011 organic reserve replacement of 120%. Of the organic reserves we added last year, less than 10% were from natural gas and Lower 48 in Canada. We'll report our F&D costs when we file our 10-K in late February, but we expect those to be in the $15 to $20 per BOE range. As we previously indicated, our capital budget for 2012 was $15.5 billion, and 90% of this will be directed towards E&P. We expect our 2012 exploration expense to be around $1.2 billion, and I'll make a few comments about our progress in developing our exploration portfolio in some core areas. ","First, in Australia, we have plans to commence a 5 to 7 well appraisal program around the Poseidon discovery later this quarter. In Angola, we've officially received our operating licenses for Blocks 36 and 37, and we've committed to a seismic program that's going to begin this quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, we've participated in the recent deepwater lease sale where ConocoPhillips was a successful bidder representing an expenditure of about $157 million net for 75 blocks in the pale Eugene play. And we continue to pursue high-quality liquids-rich unconventional opportunities. In 2011, we added 500,000 acres in North America shale plays in areas that include the Avalon, the Wolfcamp, the Niobrara and the Lower 48 and the Duvernay and the Canol in Canada. In the Caspian, we expect to spud the Nursultan well later this quarter. ","So now I'll shift to our progress in growing our liquids-rich shale business in North America. That's the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian and the Cardium plays. First, at Eagle Ford, we are currently running 16 rigs in the play. We expect to maintain a 16 rig count average and drill about 180 wells in 2012. Production in late December was around 50,000 BOE per day, and we continue to see some impacts from curtailments related to infrastructure constraints as a result of the higher well volumes and the increasing liquid content and just our ongoing development activity. We would anticipate that average production from the Eagle Ford should grow to around 100,000 BOE per day by the end of 2012. In the Permian, in the Bakken, we are running a total of 12 -- 10 rigs and expect to increase this by as much as 50% during 2012. The fourth quarter production at the Permian and Bakken averaged 50,000 BOE per day and 18,000 BOE per day, respectively. The Permian activities are focused around the Avalon, the Wolfberry and the Wolfcamp, and we're using both horizontal and vertical drilling techniques there. ","So in addition to our efforts on shale, we're progressing major projects globally. During the quarter, the APLNG joint venture announced 2 sales agreements that complete the marketing of APLNG's second train, with the sanctioning of this train construction expected during first quarter of 2012. In conjunction with this LNG sale to Sinopec, the joint venture partners also agreed to terms which will allow Sinopec to raise their equity interest in the project from 15% to 25%. ","In the North Sea, the development of our Jasmine field's under way, with startup expected later this year. We expect peak production rates of around 34,000 BOE per day in 2013 from that development. Our Ekofisk South and Eldfisk 2 projects continue to progress, and production from both these projects are expected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The Wood River CORE project started operations in mid-November, and it's resulting in a 5% increase in the clean product yield at that refinery. Our Chemicals joint venture plans to build a world scale 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene cracker and 2, 500,000 metric ton per year polyethylene units near its existing Cedar Bayou facility or near a site, near the CPChem Sweeny Area facility in Old Ocean, Texas. And the estimated project completion date for these will be 2017. And our Midstream joint venture has several growth projects underway. These include developments in Niobrara, Permian, Eagle Ford and the Granite Wash plays, along with logistic opportunities in the Mid-Continent area. ","And finally, a couple of items from the Corporate perspective. 2012 DD&A is estimated to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter this year, and Corporate expenses in 2012 are expected to be around $1 billion on an annual basis, excluding any onetime impacts related to the repositioning efforts. ","So that concludes the prepared remarks, so we're ready to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of domestic production questions. You've had a very good sequential growth in your Lower 48 liquids production. It looks like throughout this year 10,000 to 14,000 barrels a day quarter-on-quarter growth. Jeff, you mentioned that some of that is working through the backlog, though there's still a little bit of a backlog. How can we think about these numbers over the course of 2012? You've got a big ramp-up in the Eagle Ford coming. You mentioned the Permian and the Bakken. Are these the types of sequential growth rates that are doable in your Lower 48 liquids business?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so maybe just talking about Eagle Ford, so as we mentioned, the Eagle Ford is going from, we think, 50,000 a day to around 100,000 at the end of 2012. We probably have around 10,000 BOE per day that's held back because of infrastructure constraints.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that number used to be like a 30 kind of number if I'm remembering correctly, in terms of backlog production?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It comes and goes. So as we've commented, as Eagle Ford continues to ramp up, we'll be probably working with infrastructure constraints on through this year and on into 2013. I think that once we get beyond the 2013, we feel like the infrastructure constraints will be largely behind us. So if you just looked at Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the Permian, maybe those, our fourth quarter production from those areas was around 116,000 BOE per day, and that was right at 50,000 out of Eagle Ford, about 18,000 out of the Permian, and -- about 18,000 out of Bakken and 50,000 out of the Permian. We see that over time that those are going to grow to where they get to be in the 2013 to 2015 time period of over 250,000 to maybe 275,000 BOE per day. And it's going to just increase just fairly steadily over that time period.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. Conversely, on the gas side, obviously, very low gas price, too.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about where your gas rig count was in 2011 or where it ended the year, whatever metric you have, where it's going in 2012? And then what you think that means in terms of what happens to your Lower 48 gas volumes in 2012?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think our Lower 48 gas volumes will continue to decline. I don't have a...","C. C. Reasor","We've got, I think we've got 1 rig running at Lobo, which is primarily gas...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","C. C. Reasor","And San Juan's got some liquids with it, but we've got 4 rigs running there. So of the 35 to 40 rigs in the Lower 48.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","C. C. Reasor","Less than 5 of them are really pointing toward gas.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","C. C. Reasor","And I don't think we've got much capital in 2012 allocated towards new gas drilling.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","If you look at gas drilling, it's in the few hundreds of millions of dollars of our capital program that is addressed towards gas drilling. And even that level of expenditure, given the more recent developments in natural gas pricing is something that we're looking pretty closely at.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So would a high single-digit decline rate be a fair number if you're spending essentially no capital on pure gas?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's probably a fair number, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I know Arjun just kind of covered natural gas, but I had to question that in the past, I know during weak gas pricing periods, we've seen Conoco shut in production. I was curious if we're going to hear something on that front this morning. Is that in the cards here near term?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. Let me talk about -- that's a good question. Let me talk about gas production. So our fourth quarter natural gas production in Canada and the Lower 48 was around 2.5 Bcf a day, so 400, and maybe a little -- 400, 410 MBOE per day. So if we -- as we look across that portfolio, there's probably 2\/3 of it, which where the economics are really driven by liquids production and not natural gas prices. So kind of off the top, there's a portion of our portfolio which is just not going to make sense to shut in. Then if you look at -- so maybe 1.5 out of that 2.5 Bcf of natural gas is really associated with liquids production. Looking at, say, the remaining Bcf a day, some of that we operate, some of that they don't operate, and we have partners on a lot of that production as well, and partners have different views about shut-ins. But most, I think our partners generally not wanting to shut in natural gas and lose the cash flow associated with that. So we are looking at the portion of our production that we can -- that we kind of control that decision entirely on, and think that we will have some shut-ins of natural gas going forward and it's going to be on the order of 100 million cubic feet a day, or something like 15,000 to 20,000 BOE per day going forward, and we'll continue to watch that as we -- as the year goes on and we see how the natural gas markets develop.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. Very helpful. And the last question I had for you: I was curious if you have any update on Venezuela. Obviously, one of your peers has had a -- I guess you could say less than favorable arbitration results recently, and I'm just curious if you have any comments you could make.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so you're referring to the Exxon -- really that got into their ICC arbitration. So we chose not to pursue ICC arbitration and then chose -- instead chose to pursue exit arbitration, which is the World Bank process. We've been through that hearing. We're waiting ruling on that, which we expect will occur, could occur any -- early this year even. But we can't really be certain of the timing of that. And we still feel very good about the case we have there. Again, like we said on previous calls with the initial ruling will be a battle, will probably not result in a number, but will result in kind of the parameters around -- which the number will be calculated and then we'll have a period where that will be done and there'll be a period where appeals can also happen. So we're still at least 2 or 3 years away from having something that we can collect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question. Going back to, you gave some numbers on the unconventional volumes in the U.S. In the Bakken, you said you did what, about 15,000 barrels a day right now, of equipment production?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","About 18,000.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","18,000, okay. And at Permian you're doing around...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","50,000.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","15,000, okay.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","50,000. 5,0. 50,000.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","5,0, okay. That makes sense. And then if you can just contrast the Bakken to the Eagle Ford for a second here, because in the Eagle Ford, you guys are running 16 rigs. You're doing 50,000 barrels a day, going to 100,000. In the Bakken, you're going from 10 to 15 rigs and you're only doing about 18,000. I mean is -- are the economics that much better in the Eagle Ford for you than in the Bakken? Or is there some sort of a ramp-up period or well backlog that we're waiting for in the Bakken to come online?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's both of those things, Faisel. The economics are better for us in the Eagle Ford than they are in the Bakken so that will have priority as we think about where we're allocating our capital. We hold our leases in the Bakken on a long-term basis and don't need to do drilling there in order to maintain our acreage position. So we're taking a very measured approach there. We don't want to get ahead of infrastructure in the Bakken. So you'll see us continue to ramp up our activities there. They're good strong return projects, but it's not as strong as what's -- what we have in the Eagle Ford.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just one question on the asset sale program, you announced the Colonial sale. You announced the Seaway sale. Is there -- are there other logistics assets that you guys are looking to divest of? Or are we still expected from here on out for most of the asset sales to be on the upstream side?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think the upstream sides and we are -- have a marketing process that's going on, on 2 refineries right now as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of things. I don't know if I missed this in your prepared remarks, Jeff, but what is the current status of Bohai Bay? Are you back on stream? Are you allowed to bring it back up and what is its production level if you can help us out, first of all?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So production levels were down about 30,000, I think we said 33,000 a day in the fourth quarter, from our previous levels which was our kind of our 45,000, 50,000 level.","C. C. Reasor","15,000 to 20,000 barrels a day.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","In the fourth quarter. So we are working through a process of getting a revised field operating and development plan approved. We're working that with the relevant agencies in China where we hope to proceed with that as soon as we can. But we can't really give you guidance on exactly when that's going to occur.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Clayton, the numbers are currently at about 15,000 to 20,000. Is that still a good run rate as we look forward for now?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Well, I think we could see that actually -- it'll vary during 2012. It could potentially be lower in the first quarter and then improve as the year goes out.","C. C. Reasor","Yes, it's as good as anything that we can give you right now.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. I hate to pound on the issue of shutting in gas production, but if I may just get some clarification there that -- so you're suggesting you could maybe shut in about $100 million a day. Is that operated or are there third-party production that you might have an interest in as well that might change out further? A little bit of clarity on that would be appreciated, Jeff, please.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So that's just looking at the things that we operate where we largely control the decision, I think...","C. C. Reasor","And that don't have any liquids production.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Because they don't have any significant liquid production or don't have any kind of operational concerns that you have to work through with shutting in. I think this will be a subject that gets discussed quite a bit between partners all throughout the industry as we go forward. And that could change if we have persistent low natural gas prices. But our kind of immediate guidance is that it looks like the numbers we said, something on the order of 15,000 to 20,000 BOE per day or around 100,000.","C. C. Reasor","Up to that amount, I guess, would be more...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Is what it looks like we'll be moving on soon.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my final one, if I can squeeze one more in is just a very quick update please on the infrastructure in the Eagle Ford. I mean clearly, the ramp-up has continued to go very, very strong. So are you managing to keep up with that? And I'll leave it at that.","C. C. Reasor","Yes, there are a couple of things that have happened in the fourth quarter. There's -- so takeaway capacity's increased significantly in the fourth quarter over the third. There's additional trucks. There's a new condensate pipeline station which came online in late September. As Jeff mentioned, we have some production curtailment due to infrastructure constraints as a result of well volumes, but we're going to work with several companies to increase offtake capacity in the near and long-term and get transportation commitments set up for condensate and also increase or invest in increasing gas gathering and processing capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Clayton, can we just talk about the splits? I know you've been fairly specific about this, but I just wanted to reconfirm the date for the intended split. And then I had a question which you may not frankly be able to answer. But if the cash from operations you talked about in 2011, I think it was $19.6 billion, could you separate the upstream and downstream components of that? And perhaps spin forward your latest thoughts on versus whether or not it's a 2011 cash flow, whatever else you assume that cycle cash flow would be, how the upstream and downstream companies in your latest thinking, will be spending money in growing. You mentioned a major Chemicals project in your prepared remarks, for example. Any further just updates on the split process would be great.","C. C. Reasor","Sure. I think Jeff mentioned that you see the split occurring in the second quarter as early as May. I still think that's probably where we want to stay.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so we're progressing well and kind of the things that you're seeing some Form 10s filed and the revisions of those filed. We're progressing well on our RS.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So no major hurdles essentially as far as you can tell?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, I think things are progressing well to get in the second quarter and it could happen as early as May.","C. C. Reasor","In terms of your 2011 cash flow question, we gave you net income for R&M...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. So I think, so we generated basically $20 billion of cash flow in 2011. Broadly speaking, 80% of that $16 billion or so came from upstream and 20%, $4 billion, came from downstream.","C. C. Reasor","Yes, I've got $3.75 billion in net income from R&M and $850 million in DD&A. So yes...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","From special items.","C. C. Reasor","It's got some special items in it that you have to pull out, but we disclose those. And then you've got also on the cash flow, you've got of course, the dividends that are coming out of the Chemicals and the Midstream business.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right. So I think upstream will be spending its money predominantly on organic growth, and we've talked a lot about that, what the projects are that are making that up and that we anticipate that we'll be seeing 3% to 4% production growth.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Around $15 billion a year for spending?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","$14 billion. So we've announced the $15.5 billion capital program for 2012, and that's basically $14 billion upstream and...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","$1.5 billion?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","$1.2 billion, $1.3 billion downstream and a few couple hundred million of other expenses, other expenditures. So upstream, we'll be executing that organic growth program and that's what -- the production increases, and as we've -- equally significant, the changes are in our portfolio, which are going to drive increases in cash margins for BOE are what is -- are the growth drivers for upstream. And then downstream, we'll be...","C. C. Reasor","For downstream, there's probably $1 billion or so of capital that goes into the R&M business as far as just keeping our refineries safe and making sure that we've got, doing the right things around our refining business. The excess cash flow coming out of Phillips 66, we're talking internally about where that goes right now, whether that's into Chemicals or Midstream ventures. Those are probably more likely candidates for the free cash flow that comes out of the business. But we'll be able to provide you with more of our thinking about that before the split.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Before May, you'll be coming back with a more specific set of go-forward assumptions?","C. C. Reasor","Yes, the plan -- we're not going to have an -- the typical Analyst Meeting that we have in March, we've decided not to have. But we do plan on meeting with you and with others in the financial community about what our plans are both at Phillips 66 and with ConocoPhillips. I think both Ryan and Greg will be available to the Street and we'll -- we haven't scheduled that. But think about a March or April timeframe when we'll be out there and be able to fill you in a bit more on what our thinking is.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one, I guess, the main issue in my mind, Clayton and Jeff is the buyback, and just can you remind us what happens with the buyback at once we've split, how that works going forward?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So we are -- we talked about asset sales of $5 billion to $10 billion, and that's pretty heavily weighted to the upstream side of the business, and going forward, when we said that share repurchases will generally kind of track along with that, which says that we are continuing to buy shares currently, not at the same rates that we were buying them last year. But we're going -- so you'll see first quarter that there'll be some buybacks that occur actually in the first quarter. Then the pace of buybacks will depend upon the pace of our asset sales program, and that really goes for ConocoPhillips both before and after the split of the downstream company. And the downstream company, as Clayton mentioned, they'll be out -- will be out before the split, talking more about how we're going to be allocating cash in that business.","C. C. Reasor","Yes, the thinking, at least right now, around use of cash in Phillips 66 post-split, I would say, we've prioritized the first couple of billion or so towards debt reduction versus share repurchase. But those decisions have yet to be made.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's great. I think you've given me enough pieces there to fit it again, together. Which is very finally, Clayton, on the asset sales, within Phillips 66, could you -- is there any update on, I think, it was Alliance and Trainer that were publicly known to be out there?","C. C. Reasor","Yes, I think we don't really have updates. I think data rooms are open I think we're -- indicative bids are -- the deadline's coming up and we'll take a look at what comes in and then make our decisions going forward. We don't have anything to add from what we already talked about earlier on Trainer or Alliance.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But news shortly?","C. C. Reasor","If -- maybe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things, if I could. Did the endeavor sale of the U.K. assets close in the fourth quarter?","C. C. Reasor","First quarter, was it...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, that's still yet to close.","C. C. Reasor","Right. Did not close.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, anything going on with respect to the Vietnam sale? There've been a lot of talk in the trades about bids that you've received, yet haven't heard much of anything in terms of discussions coming to a conclusion.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think we're going to give you the same answer we've been giving you on asset sales as we just are working through a lot of different processes, and we -- it's not helpful to us to try to have a lot of information out until we get kind of to a finishing point on those. So not -- I'm afraid there's not much we can update on you -- update you on there.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the Eagle Ford production numbers, Jeff and Clayton, that you talked about, still running about 70% liquids? And do you expect as the numbers build to maintain that kind of liquids ratio?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think we see more like 75% liquids, and yes, that is our expectation going forward.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","You think you'll hold it at that level?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay.","C. C. Reasor","And of course, Mark, I think the classification for the liquids there are -- is retrograde condensate is the term that's used internally to describe those liquids.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm not sure what you mean by that, Clayton.","C. C. Reasor","The volume just has [indiscernible].","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","As opposed to NGL, you mean?","C. C. Reasor","Well, no, this is -- I mean it is -- there's an NGL component but it's primarily condensate.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's a high-value liquid.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. All right. And in terms of the LIFO item, if I can call it that, in the fourth quarter, can I assume that's entirely U.S., that it's an after-tax figure and that it's included in your recorded and published refining margin?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, it is. Yes. It's all U.S. and all -- it is after-tax and it is included.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","And one final one for me. There's been a fair amount of talk -- this isn't actually asset sales-oriented, but I've seen a fair amount of talk that you may be seeking partners either for your Eagle Ford activities and\/or your Canadian oil sands outside of the partnerships with Synovus. Can you comment on the veracity of that?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So we intend to pursue Eagle Ford as 100% development going forward. So I hadn't heard that one, but we can tell you that there's nothing behind that. We are investigating options for our oil sands properties outside of the Foster Creek, Christina Lake joint venture. We think there's quite a bit of interest in properties like that. So we're going -- we'll do some things to find out how the market would value those and make our decisions going forward based on what we find out. But we would intend to maintain interest in the properties outside of FCCL. It's just a question whether we might -- would it be value to bringing in a partner to develop those.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","And Jeff, that would include Surmont?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, it would include Surmont.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, final one for me, excluding the WRB partnership, give me a rough idea of the WTI reference priced crude that you ran in the fourth quarter, taking the partnership out of the equation.","C. C. Reasor","This is fourth quarter WTI?","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","The fourth quarter WTI reference x WRB?","C. C. Reasor","X Borger and Wood River is going to be -- I think it's going to be around 200,000 barrels a day, but let us check our numbers. Including those 2, it's somewhere between 450,000 and 500,000. So I just have to back out what Borger and Wood River represent.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, well, that's pretty much 100% on those 2, isn't it? If WTI reference, if you include WCS is WTI reference crude?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, and we have half of Borger and half of Wood River so that's what? That's 350,000 or 250,000?","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, something like that.","C. C. Reasor","250,000.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I mean, the math seems to work.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's 200,000 to 250,000, something like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Several quick questions. Jeff, you say $180 million of the inventory gain pretax number. Should we just assume a 35% tax rate?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's probably a good assumption, yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. In the Bohai Bay, the press release talking about the settlement with the compensation fund. Is that settled or the lawsuit update or that there's other things that are still pending we should be aware?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So the settlement is for the fisheries that were potentially impacted by the spill, which is the primary issue that we were dealing with. So we -- that's probably about all we can say at that point, we don't know if there will be others -- other things beyond that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How about from the regulator, I think that they have fined you guys some small amount? I presume that based on the Chinese law that there's really no other major potential fine that we should expect from the regulator, right?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So I think, Paul, all we can really say at this point is we think that the settlement we just announced last night is an important step forward and it resolves kind of the most pressing issues that are out there and we're just going to need to move forward with the process with the authorities there, and there's not a lot else we can comment on at this point in time.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Jeff, what is the Libyan production right now for you guys?","C. C. Reasor","Libyan production...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Is around 20,000 barrels a day.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Net to you?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Net to us, yes, that's right. So that's our share of the Waha concession.","C. C. Reasor","We've got, what, 16\u2026","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","16.33% at\u2026","C. C. Reasor","At Waha?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And Jeff, when looking at your financial statement, you have about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of the deferred tax cash contribution in 2011. Is that all contributed from the IDC deduction in the U.S. or does it relate to other things also?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, really it doesn't. It's primarily related to timing differences between tax depreciation and financial depreciation.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So that's not related to IDC?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","IDC could be a small portion of that number, but it's not a big number for us.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's a small portion. And once that is spin off, the treatment for the IDC deduction is going to change. Currently, you are deducting what, 50% or 75%?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Paul, I'd have to get back to you. We don't -- it's not a very high percentage of that number because of the category that we fall in. It's different rules for different size producers. And then even going forward, it's a complex set of rules upon -- that depend -- that will determine which category you fall into. And we could be still considered and integrated by some of those measures even going forward because we have things like fractionation capacity and some of our processing up in the North Slope. So it's not as clear-cut as just kind of saying that we move from one category to another.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So you currently, based on your best guess is, that you may not change that much for you?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I'm not sure that we see that that's a significant change for us. That's correct.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. And, that, Clayton, is it possible that if you can share that what is the benefit in 2011 for you guys from the cash flow standpoint related to the IDC deduction?","C. C. Reasor","So...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","We don't know that number off the top of our heads.","C. C. Reasor","Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I mean, if at some -- I mean that if you find it, can you just e-mail me?","C. C. Reasor","We can work that up.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That would be great. Final one, the APLNG, the Sinopec, interest increased to 25%. Last time when the opted in there was a waiver. Should we assume the asset we sold that carrying costs for you guys is already now at a level that increase in the interest in [indiscernible] is not going to change in your carrying value?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so we'll be working that as we go forward. It depends some -- on some exactly when the whole transaction ends up closing. We will have an additional write-down on APLNG when that transaction closes. It won't be of the same magnitude of what we had before. And right now, we'd say that's in the neighborhood of $100 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$100 million?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Weiss from Argus Research.","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Just a couple of quick questions. The North America acreage acquisition that you mentioned, any color on how much or where those were?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","They were -- we're kind of reluctant to just give kind of exactly what was where. But it's in the areas we mentioned which are the Duvernay, the Canol, Avalon, Wolfcamp, Niobrara and some other areas. It was probably 2\/3 Canadian, 1\/3 Lower 48 acreage, and it was all targeting plays which we believe are liquids-rich plays and not gas plays.","C. C. Reasor","There was some public disclosures on the Ute license round at Wolfcamp, but we haven't given a lot of detail yet because we're not finished -- not  finished buying.","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Okay. The exploration expense, any dry hole charges you can identify in the quarter?","C. C. Reasor","Let's see, I think we got this. So we had, what, $141 million dry hole expense in E&P for the quarter? I think that's the number. But I don't -- think there was -- well, I just don't -- we can get back to you on that one, Phil. I don't know where those were. But obviously it was higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the rest of the year. But we can come back and let you know where those dry hole expenses took place.","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Okay, and then last one, there's just something I'm a little bit confused about. When I look at the financial statement information that you gave, that showed impairments in the fourth quarter of $304 million. But then when you have the special items, the impairments were like $695 million, and I didn't understand why that was.","C. C. Reasor","So are you looking at Page 3 on the special items page on the supplement?","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Yes.","C. C. Reasor","And the question is, what? E&P impairments or. . .","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Well, if I look at the consolidated income statement, it shows impairments of $304 million. And then if you look at Page 3, just for E&P, for international E&P impairments, it's $585 million and for U.S., it's $44 million, so that's $629 million, and I think there was -- I think the total number when you did your whole reconciliation was $695 million.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, let us do some -- let me come back to you on that one. I'll give you a call this afternoon.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I'm not sure where we put in that $304 million number on the phase of income statement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniela Almeida from Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Iain Reid, actually from Jefferies over in London. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, on the oil sands, just on your oil sands disposal, can you say why it's Surmont you're looking to reduce your interest in rather than the FCCL joint venture? Is it just because of the fact that it's a joint venture that's tied up with the refining? Or is there kind of a specific reason why it's Surmont and the other assets rather than that?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So I think we looked at the Surmont project and our remaining assets and complying with the FCCL and thinking of the size of oil sands in our portfolio and also the values that people attribute to properties that are kind of out in the marketplace right now, I think it makes sense to just find out what value the market would ascribe to that. It's most straightforward to do that on the Surmont project. But it's not just Surmont, it's the Thornberry pipe and Sulesky acreage that we have as well that we would consider doing something with as a package.","C. C. Reasor","And FCCL, I think we would probably look at as more of part of our portfolio and good economics and something that's going to generate growth for us over a longer period of time and good returns. I think most people look at FCCL as probably the premier oil sands assets. And so it could be that TCS and Surmont won't be able to generate the types of returns that FCCL can.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I wonder whether your thoughts have changed or progressed in terms of LNG exports now you've seen these deals signed up in the Gulf coast, for the [indiscernible] with intent to build. Is that something that -- which you might look at again or put more emphasis on given the sort of substantial amounts of U.S. gas that you're producing? Or will be producing?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think it's something we are going to continue to study. It's really not just a thinking about it from the perspective of Lower 48 natural gas production. But as we think about to what long-term alternatives are for Canadian gas production. And importantly, as we think about what alternatives could be for development of the North Slope gas in Alaska. Those are all things that we'll be investigating whether liquefaction and export and natural gas makes sense going forward.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last one, just coming back. There's $180 million of inventory liquidation. Can we assume that, that is all associated with the shutdown of Trainer and the associated tankage and pipes, et cetera?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","A large part of it was Trainer -- things we had in inventory in the Seaway Products pipeline. For example, we sold some terminals during the year that had inventory as well. So Trainer made it with the largest single component of that, but it wasn't all related to Trainer.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So this wasn't a kind of an inventory price adjustment? This was a real liquidation and exit from that?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, that we reduced our inventories kind of across the system by about 10 million barrels during the year.","Operator","Our final question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of questions here on the quarter. Just a follow-up on the last question on the inventory liquidation, I mean, is there any quantification on what is coming back, what is year-end related that we should see back in 1Q?","C. C. Reasor","In terms of building inventory?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's right.","C. C. Reasor","Probably not. You're saying what our inventories levels will return to?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's right. If there's anything, I know there's some that's some inventory liquidation, but if some was into taking inventories down into year end, if something would come back in 1Q at an offset.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so I mean, we have inventories related to our system and then we have some inventories that we take on as kind of more of a systems optimization trading type operations. We'll bring some of those back on in the first quarter. But I don't think we have the number that we can give you as guidance right now.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. On the change in the Corporate charge, $151 million, I mean, can you deconstruct that a little bit just so, again, the same, to understand better what's recurring? I presume that the ForEx element would be a nonrecurring change.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. The ForEx is a nonrecurring change, and you can see in our supplemental information that, that was $45 million to $50 million of that difference. We changed the -- in our comments you probably picked up we were saying Corporate costs, we would say going forward are more of a $1 billion per year run rate and we're $250 million a quarter. I think our previous guidance was more like $275 million a quarter. So just interest costs lower being a driver of that.","C. C. Reasor","Capitalized interest.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","And then yes, capitalized interest was a little bit higher than we initially anticipated it was going to be. So that -- I think those are the major drivers of it. So ForEx is a big part of that, which is not a -- which is going to be changed from quarter-to-quarter.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. Angola block payment, was that included in 4Q?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, it was a first quarter 2012 item.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned Chevron Phillips. You guys were conducting the study for the 3 billion ton Gulf Coast, I think, cracker. What were the key dates in 2012 in that project? I mean, when will we get -- be more specifics on cost and FID dates, timing, et cetera?","C. C. Reasor","Yes, so I'm not sure exactly when we go FID on it. I know, well, to answer your question, I guess, we'll give you more information on that in late March, early April when we come out and start talking about the sources of growth for Phillips 66.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, can you just follow up on the buyback. I mean, does the -- does your buyback guidance in '12 contemplate the $5.8 billion distribution related to the leveraging on Phillips 66 because that would impact the kind of timing of available cash?","C. C. Reasor","I don't think the intent is to use -- how they intend to use Phillips 66 back for debt reduction primarily.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so primarily. So we're talking about...","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, I got you. At the Conoco level.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. So we'll have it's like roughly $6 billion of proceeds come in from the distribution as we contemplated it now. And we'll probably use -- we've targeted at taking our ConocoPhillips debt level down to around $18 billion; at the end of the year, $22.5 billion. So we're going to use $4.5 billion of that to reduce debt. So there will be some that goes into the cash from that distribution.","C. C. Reasor","But the thinking on share repurchases is really, Evan, think about share repurchase as being funded the asset sales. That's really what's going -- that's what's going to fund that activity.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And then based upon, at least the bid dates, you're hopeful that the 2 refining asset sales would be -- could be received prior to distribution?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think it's probably -- no, I don't think that we would give you that impression. There'll be things to work through on refinery sales which will probably take those post -- post-bid.","C. C. Reasor","So I guess that was the last question. Kim, appreciate you lining those up for us and appreciate everybody participating on the call. You can find our material, again, on our website. I look forward to talking with you in the near future. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, the Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may being.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine. Thanks to all of our participants and a big welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today in the room are Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production. We will begin our prepared remarks in a moment.","But I wanted to make sure that all of you saw the announcements this morning that we completed the sale of our Kashagan business for about $5.4 billion. Just a quick mechanical point, we sent the earnings release and the Kashagan releases separately, that was because we had to queue up the earnings release last night and weren\u2019t entirely certain about the timing of the Kashagan close. So, apologizes there for a little bit of possible confusion; but this is obviously a huge milestone for the business and wanted to get the news out to the marketplace this morning.","Also wanted to make sure that all of who saw in our release this morning that we expect to announce our 2014 capital and production budget in early December and then in 2014 we will be hosting our Analyst Meeting on the 10th of April in New York, obviously details to follow.","If you\u2019ll turn to page two, you\u2019ll note our Safe Harbor statement and that describes the risks and uncertainties and our future performance, these are also described in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With those details out of the way, I am going to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeff Sheets","Thanks, Ellen. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I am going to jump right into material beginning on the slide three, this slide shows some of the key highlights for the quarter.","Once again the theme of today\u2019s call is pretty simple, we are successfully executing on our business plan. Operationally, we delivered our expected volumes. We produced 1.514 million BOE per day which is in line with guidance despite the curtailment of Libyan production for most of the quarter.","From continuing operations, we produced 1.47 million BOE per day. Without the disruptions in Libya, we would exceeded the high end of our production guidance. As we\u2019ve stated for quite some time, we expected this quarter to be the low point of volumes and we are positioned to grow from here. The third quarter was an active period of seasonal planned maintenance. We executed this key turnarounds on schedule and most of that work is complete for the year.","Our major growth projects are progressing Christina Lake Phase E and Ekofisk South are now producing and others are nearing first oil. We have several near-term milestones that Matt will discuss in a minute so operationally we executed our plan.","Moving to the financial results reported earnings were $2.5 billion or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion or $1.47 per share. This is 7% increase year-over-year. We were also up 4% sequentially despite this being the low point for volumes. And excluding working capital, we generated $3.8 billion in cash from continuing operations and we ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash.","Cash margins grew 13% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter reflecting the impact of higher prices, production mix and location. Normalized for changes in prices cash margins grew 3% year-over-year. This is an important part of growing cash flows to internally fund our investment programs and dividends over time.","In the quarter, we continued to prune our portfolio and closed on two non-strategic asset sales our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold in Canada and our interest in the Phoenix Park midstream asset in Trinidad and Tobago.","And as Ellen mentioned at the start of the call, importantly, we achieved a big milestone earlier today with the closing and receipt of funds for the $5.4 billion Kashagan transaction. And we continue to make progress on closing our other announced assets sales. We are continuing to add to and test our conventional and unconventional exploration inventory globally and these programs are running at a high level of activity.","Finally, we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In early July we increased our dividend by 4.5% and we remain committed to increasing the dividend overtime.","In summary, we delivered our plan for the quarter. We achieve the operational performance we expected and generated the strong financial results. We are positioned for an exciting phase of growth and margin expansion, which is the essence of our strategic plan.","So please turn to slide four, and we\u2019ll cover the financial review for the quarter. Again, this quarter\u2019s adjusted earnings were 1.8 billion or $1.47 per share and this was slightly above consensus. The 7% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was primarily driven by higher margins. The higher margins reflect strong liquids pricing in the quarter and a continued shift to higher value liquids in the portfolio.","Average realizations were up 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Production from continuing operations was in line with expectations, but down sequentially and flat compared to the third quarter of 2012, largely reflecting the curtailments in Libya.","We have shown a table of segment earnings for the quarter in the lower right corner of the slide, our usual segment charts can be found in the appendix of this deck and we don\u2019t plan to review these on the call but wanted to make a few key points there. Alaska income was down sequentially due to planned maintenance but in line with our expectations. Lower 48 adjusted earnings were up sequentially, reflecting strong liquids prices and the mix shift.","Canada generated significantly higher adjusted earnings sequentially as well. Although natural gas prices were weaker than last quarter, bitumen prices were particularly strong, reflecting higher WTI prices, favorable diluent prices, lower crude differentials and lower seasonal blending requirements, sort of a perfect set of conditions for the oil sands.","At this point, we would not expect fourth quarter realizations for bitumen to be as strong. Europe and the Asia Pacific and Middle East segments were also in line with expectations.","Our Corporate segment adjusted losses were about $40 million higher than in the second quarter of 2013 due to the absence of licensing revenues in the third quarter. This was about the same level we would expect for the fourth quarter as well. So, there is no change to our full year guidance of $750 million for this segment.","Next I\u2019ll step through our production performance for the quarter on Slide 5. Total company production in the second quarter was 1.514 million BOE per day and this includes 44,000 BOE per day from discontinued operations. This chart shows continuing operations compared to the third quarter of 2012; and in the third quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.47 million BOE per day.","Adjusting for dispositions of 12,000 BOE per day normalized production from continuing operations was 1.548 million in last year\u2019s third quarter and that\u2019s the middle blue bar in the chart. And I\u2019ll talk about growth from there. The Libya downtime accounted for 28,000 barrels per day reduction compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, but that was partially offset by lower downtime in the rest of our operations around 11,000 per day in this year\u2019s third quarter.","The key is the next two bars. You can see that growth of 215,000 barrels per day more than offset declines of 186,000 barrels per day, this represents net organic growth of 29,000 per day or about 2% adjusted for dispositions and downtime.","The majority of the growth came from our development projects in the Lower 48 shale plays, growth in our oil sands asset from China. And as I mentioned before this should be the low point on continuing operations volume that we\u2019ve been predicting for a while and we are now positioned for an upward trend.","If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll make a few comments about the improving margin trend we also have underway. This slide shows how our third quarter growth and changing mix drove cash margin improvement compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.","The chart shows the change in this quarter\u2019s volumes by region and product compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. The growth shown in green is all from liquids. In addition, it\u2019s coming in areas with more favorable fiscal terms in the company average notably the Lower 48, Canada and the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East segments. Normal field declines in Alaska and Europe and lower natural gas North American natural gas production somewhat offset the growth.","Slide 7, shows the impact of our growth, mix shift and fiscals on our margin performance. This slide shows sequential and year-over-year cash margins both on a reported basis and on price normalized basis. Compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, cash margins grew 13%, sequentially cash margins grew 6% and realized prices improved compared to both periods, but that\u2019s not the whole story.","On the right side of the page using our public sensitivity as we price normalized margins with last year\u2019s third quarter as the base line, as you can see cash margins improved 3% on a price normalized basis compared to last year. This metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we expect the trend to continue to improve as we shift production towards higher value products and places with more favorable fiscal terms. And we will continue to track and report this metric.","I\u2019ll wrap up my comments with our cash flow waterfall and quarter financial position on slide eight. I am going to talk you through our cash flow and this does not include the proceeds from Kashagan, which we announced this morning and virtually our fourth quarter item. Through the third quarter of 2013, we generated $11.8 billion of cash from continuing operations and our working capital was about $100 million source of cash. Through the end of September, we\u2019ve generated $3.2 billion in asset sales proceeds from the sale of Cedar Creek Anticline asset, the Clyden asset, the Phoenix Park and some smaller asset packages.","If you include Kashagan, and this increases to $8.6 billion. So, far this year, we\u2019ve funded $11.9 billion capital program for continuing operations and paid out $2.5 billion in dividends. Debt and other, which includes the capital, associated with discontinued operations accounts for $1.2 billion use of cash in 2013. So, we had $3.9 billion of cash on hand as of September 30, essentially flat to where we started the year.","Our balance sheet and financial situation are very strong and just got stronger today with the closing and receipt of the proceeds from the Kashagan disposition. We are in a great position to execute our investment programs and deliver value through a combination of organic growth, improving margins and a compelling dividend.","That concludes the review of the financial overview and now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations which begins on Slide 9.","Matt Fox","Thank you, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned the main theme of this quarter\u2019s operational performance has been on plan, in fact that\u2019s been the theme over the past several quarters. I\u2019m going to cover the operations material by our capital categories. As a reminder those are high qualify based assets, our lower risk development drilling programs, our major projects, and our exploration program.","So I\u2019ll begin with a quick review of our base asset performance. Most importantly this quarter\u2019s major turnaround and tie-in activity went according to plan. And this essentially completes the majority of a major turnaround activity for this year.","I\u2019ll run through a few of these key activities quickly. Alaska experienced high seasonal turnaround activity at Kuparuk and Prudhoe, and the Lower 48 we had planned downtime of the Lost Cabin Gas Plant. In the UK, the Britannia Area and Southern North Sea turnarounds were completed and planned maintenance was also recently completed at the Foster Creek in the oil sands. The shutdown activity that began in Norway\u2019s Greater Ekofisk complex in June was completed early in the third quarter and included the brownfield work necessary for the new Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects.","As the chart on the lower left shows, most of our planned turnaround activity is complete for the year. Fourth quarter turnarounds are nearing completion at Clear and Qatargas 3. The restart of the assets after the recent turnaround should deliver strong volume momentum in the fourth quarter. So will the expected production startup in the East Irish Sea following about a year long shutdown there to replace the asset gas plant. So you can see our base assets performed well.","Now let\u2019s move on to our development programs on Slide 10. These development programs consist of lower risk drilling led activities around the world that mitigate our base decline and generate higher margins and attractive returns and these programs remain on track to deliver about 600,000 BOE per day of production by 2017 as shown on the top left graphic.","In the Kuparuk Field in Alaska, our core chipping drilling sidetracks continued in the third quarter. Since changes are made to Alaska\u2019s fiscal with the more Alaska production act, we added a rig in Kuparuk at the end of May. We are planning to add another rig for development drilling at Kuparuk in January and we continue to work with partners and improve to identify additional opportunities to increase activity there. A big milestone for the quarter was reaching 500,000 BOE per day in the Lower 48.","Of course, this is largely due to performance from the unconventionals in the Eagle Ford\u2019s and the Bakken, but continuing good performance from the Permian conventional program. A couple of highlights from these place Bakken production averaged 334,000 BOE per day in the year\u2019s third quarter, up 31% compared to the same quarter last year and up 13% sequentially. Our focus during the third quarter was in the time from drilling a layout to bringing in on production.","This continues to be a focus and will become even more important as we shift the pad drilling. At the end of the third quarter we had 11 operated rigs running in the Bakken, nine of which were pad drilling. The Eagle Ford also continued to deliver strong performance. Third quarter production averaged to 126,000 BOE per day, up 66% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Sequentially the Eagle Ford grew 4%, a bit lower than the first half of 2013\u2019s growth because this quarter was impacted by the commissioning of further stages of the Helena and Sugarloaf stabilization facilities and maintenance of third-party facilities to increase meter sizes resulting in a slight increase in downtime versus the second quarter.","At the end of the third quarter, we had a backlog of 77 wells waiting on facilities on various stages of completion. This represents a 38% reduction in our inventory compared to year end 2012. So we are gaining on the backlog. The Eagle Ford exited the third quarter over a 130,000 BOE a day. And for the fourth quarter, we will continue to run 11 rigs in the play and expect to bring on between 50 and 60 operated wells. As we head into 2014, we are in full transition to multi-well pad drilling are more than 1,800 remaining identified well locations assuming in 80-acre well spacing.","Right now six out of the 11 rigs running in the Eagle Ford are pad drilling. And we expect to see more variability in the quarterly production levels as we move to pad drilling, but we anticipate continued growth in this asset next year. In Western Canada, we continue to see good results from margin enhancing drilling programs in the liquid-rich plays, here our development drilling activity continues to focus on the Glauconite, Montney, Lower Cretaceous and Tri Asset place. Activity levels are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we prepare for and execute our winter drilling program.","Finally, our legacy field development programs are also on track through all of our operating areas. Now, let\u2019s discuss our major projects on slide 11, we were approaching some very important milestones. Our projects that are very high levels of activity and remain on track to deliver about 400,000 BOE per day of production by 2017, as shown on the top left graph.","Virtually, all business segments are contributing to our growth from major projects. In Alaska, our CD5 project construction is progressing on schedule and preparations are underway for the winter construction season when the ice roads are in place.","We continue to pursue engineering work and additional satellite projects for sanctioning in 2014. For example work is underway at Shark Tooth and Greater Moose\u2019s Tooth 1. We will make a decision on these projects late next year. You also probably saw a recent announcement about the site selection for a possible Alaskan LNG project which we now refer to as AKLNG. Along with our co-venturers we are performing studies now to determine the feasibility of that project.","Our oil sands project are performing as planned, the combined oil sands project averaged a 107,000 BOE per day during the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Christina Lake Phase E started up in mid-July and this should add about 20,000 BOE net over the next several months. At our operative Surmont 2 project, we remain on plan for first team in the first half of 2015.","You may have seen the announcement that we achieved first oil at Ekofisk South last week, a couple of months ahead of schedule. This is an exciting milestone for the company. Over the next few years, we\u2019ll ramp up volumes as we drill 35 producing wells and eight injection wells. And by early 2015, we\u2019ll also start first production at Eldfisk 2, so we are positioning ourselves to achieve significant growth in Norway and extend field life for decades to come.","Adjustment in the UK, we\u2019re in the final stages of our commissioning and start our preparations before initiating first oil, offshore rooftop is progressing as planned and four wells have been perforated under ready for first production. Jasmine has started of later in this quarter, which would provide good exit rate momentum going into 2014. At Curtis Island, we continue to progress our APLNG project, 311 is still on schedule for first LNG by mid-215 and critical milestones have been achieved on the project. We\u2019ve got lot going on in Malaysia, we\u2019re close to achieving major projects, stackups and two non-operated projects Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai.","Gumusut offshore commissioning continues the 10 and final rise that was installed in early September and flow line installations are complete, they operate rest of them is the full fuel starts-up will be in early Q1, 2014. The Siakap North-Petai development is continuing hookup from pre-commissioning. Umbilical installations are complete and Flowline installation is underway and they operate rest of them is to start Umbilical right at the end of this year.","Malaysia the Kapampangan development is also progressing, top side fabrication is running ahead of schedule and drilling commenced in August. The overall project remains on track for first production in the fourth quarter of 2014. So you can tell what are very exciting is critical time in many of our major products and they will be a key driver in our volume growth over the next few years.","So now I want to briefly recover our exploration program on slide 12. Our exploration efforts continue on several fronts, we are building an inventory of both conventional and unconventional opportunities. We are drilling several non-operative prospects currently and we are advancing our operating prospects to the drill-ready stage. We currently have three conventional prospects drilling in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico program.","We have an interest in the Gila and Deep Nansen wildcat prospects. In addition, we have interest in the Tiber appraisal well. So we are participating in some big important lower tertiary wells. We are also currently progressing our plans for our operating drilling program in the Gulf for 2014. And the Browse Basin of Australia, we have drilled a Proteus-1 discovery during the recent quarter. This was an untested structure to the Southeast of the Poseidon discovery.","In Indonesia, we obtained government approval for the Palangkaraya farm-in agreement, onshore Kalimantan. This creates the way to begin drilling next year. In Malaysia, we completed our seismic activity in block SB-311. In the Kwanza Basin in Angola, we completed our 3D seismic program earlier in the year.","We identified and ranked several prospects and expect to be drilling nearby mid next year. And we\u2019re just discussing several unconventional plays, especially in North America. In the Permian Basin, we\u2019re testing prospective zones across our leaseholds in the Delaware and Midland basins.","In the Niobrara, we currently have one rig in the field executing an appraisal program. It\u2019s too early to discuss results in the Permian and Niobrara, but we\u2019re encouraged by the preliminary results. In Canada, we continue to drill and appraise that differently in Montney plays and we\u2019re also gearing up for our second season of winter drilling in the Mackenzie Valley Canal play.","It sounds a pretty quick overview of our operations in exploration activity and the key takeaways of these, the operations are running well. The development programs are delivering. Stocked up of several growth projects are underway or eminent and we\u2019ve got high level of exploration activity.","If you turn to Slide 13, I\u2019ll quickly cover all this, all adds up to our production outlook for this year. The table in the bottom of the slide provides actual volumes for the first three quarters of the year and our expected range for the fourth quarter. The data is provided for both continuing and discontinued operations. Our overall volume guidance for the year is unchanged except in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re now removing 50,000 BOE from Libya as a result of the ongoing disruptions there.","What\u2019s important to know is that the fourth volumes are expected to ramp up from the third quarter due to lower turnaround activity, ramp up in our unconventional programs and the major projects startups. The range in fourth quarter volumes reflects statistical variability in major projects startup timing. We\u2019ll announce our 2014 production target with a capital release in December. In the meantime, we\u2019re positioned to deliver such strong activity in 2013 and now provide strong momentum towards achieving our organic growth goals next year.","Now please turn to Slide 14 for our summary comments. Operationally, we\u2019ve arrived at very important inflection point for the Company. We have several key milestones to achieve this quarter and we should have volume growth momentum out of 2013.","So in 2014, you should expect to see increased production from our major projects at Ekofisk South, Jasmine, Britannia long-term compression, Gumusut, Siakap North-Petai, Kebabangan, Christina Lake Phase E, Foster Creek Phase F and Lower 48 unconventional programs at Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. All these projects have contributed to 3% to 5% production growth as we detailed in our analyst meeting earlier in the year.","And as always, we expect to deliver our operational performance safely and efficiently. We\u2019re committing to maintaining a strong balance sheet that can provide financial flexibility. We\u2019re seeing the early stages of cash margin expansion, which should improve as our volumes grow.","We\u2019re focused on improving the tons and that\u2019s a driver behind continuing to rebalance our portfolio and allocate capital prudently. We\u2019re delivering on our value proposition. We continue to progress on our earnings asset divestitures and this will provide a financial flexibilities to fund our investment programs and our dividend, which remains a top priority; so I hope Jeff and I have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones this year, and positioning ConocoPhillips for an exciting 2014.","And now we\u2019re pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the delivery so far this year against your plan.","Matt Fox","Thank you.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","I guess in the slides Jeff you\u2019ve outlined $6 billion of incremental cash flow from the production growth between sort of 2013 and 2017 in a flat macro type, which is going to obviously increase your financial flexibility of the top line. But I\u2019ve got a question on CapEx, you\u2019re still investing in \u2013 and you\u2019re still investing in some LNG. Is there a year as you look out in the sort of the CapEx profile where as you sort of finalize some of those longer lived assets, you got a bit more flexibility in terms of how you could allocate sort of CapEx in the Upstream business?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, that\u2019s certainly going to be the case Ed, and really we\u2019ll detail this more in December like we indicated on our early in the call as far as 2014 capital will be. But the effect we\u2019re pointing out is probably going to be fairly pronounced in 2014, where APLNG capital will hit a peak, Surmont 2 capital will hit a peak and we will be continuing to fund the expansions in the new oil sands of Foster Creek and Christina Lake. And as we go through time will see some of those projects tail off and which will give us more flexibility to handle increase flows stemmed from the unconventionals?","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. And then in terms of obviously the longer we go through time and with Kashagan receipts in and the balance sheet looking a little bit more robust and clearly oil price hasn\u2019t collapsed in anyway; I mean what are your thoughts about maybe re-instituting a buyback program?","","Jeff Sheets","Right. So at the end of this year assuming we continue to progress the rest of our asset sales program. We\u2019re going to have significant cash balances. At the end of the year, we could be approaching nearly $10 billion \u2013 in that neighborhood of $10 billion of cash in our balance sheet.","As we think through 2014 and 2015, we\u2019re going to be increasing our cash flow, but still at the point where cash from operations is not going to completely cover capital and dividends. In terms of a buyback, I think that is something we\u2019re going to be thinking more about as we get to the point where cash from operations, funds capital and dividends on a go forward basis. Near-term I think we feel like it is important to maintain a significant level of financial flexibility to adequately invest in our capital program and fund our dividend.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much, Jeff.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Congratulations on your results everybody.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","U.S. production growth has obviously been a major success story for the company and I think out by another 40% this quarter from Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, yet it seems like the potential from the Eagle Ford continues to improve as more as known about the Company\u2019s position.","So my first question is whether Matt would agree, and second whether there will be any additional color on the position in Eagle Ford related activity, efficiency or financial performance that is stronger versus the original expectations, what has really changed here because it seems like you are much more enthusiastic on this position?","Matt Fox","Yeah Doug. We are still very excited and I would say getting more excited about Eagle Ford position and we continue to run a consistent program there, we are running 11 rigs. Our intention is essentially to continue that and we\u2019ll continue to see production growth because of that. What we\u2019ve indicated as we\u2019ve got them remaining about 1800 well locations in the Eagle ford to drill and that\u2019s all based on the assumption that we continue to drill the 80 acre spacing and we have pilot tests underway to determine if that is the right spacing that may ultimately tighten up and there will be more drilling locations.","We are also looking other levels in the Eagle Ford and for potential too. So we are still very excited about the Eagle Ford position and then we\u2019re going to see significant growth and very high margin growth from the Eagle Ford for several years to come.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks Matt. And secondly in Alaska, it appears that passage of SB21 will impact activity in the state and because you guys are largest producers in acreage order seems that you\u2019ll be the leading beneficiary. But at the same time your portfolio of how return opportunities is strong as it\u2019s been in several years. So, the question is twofold.","First how meaningful have legislative changes as it relates to your desire to invest in the state when you consider the opportunity set that you have elsewhere? And then second with ANs trading inexpensively to global markers in recent periods, my question is whether the strategy for sales to new markets is changing or put another way how is the company thinking about optimizing realizations on future output from Alaska?","Matt Fox","Yes, so the first part is SB21, the that\u2019s not probably more or less Alaska Production Act that was a significant change as a result of that we will spend more capital in Alaska. There are opportunities for investment \u2013 with the change to the fiscal regime competitive and our international portfolio. So we will be doing that. We\u2019ve enhanced a few of those I mentioned few on the call. So we definitely see potential and you\u2019re right we are very well positioned in Alaska to as the largest producer.","On the ANs and sales and so we do have the flexibility if we want to exercise to take ANs cargos to Asia and we do have the right to do that. And that will depend on the differential that we\u2019re seeing to Asian prices versus West Coast prices obviously. But it is good to have that flexibility and then as time evolves we will see if this flexibility we need to exercise.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks a lot everybody.","Matt Fox","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good afternoon everyone. I want to squall the analyst meeting party too much if I can just clarify that the page 13, volume guidance for the full year of 2013 in Q4 is consistent, I obviously seem it is with the Slide nine outlook that you have there on the high quality legacy base production. I\u2019m basically trying to get to 2014, 2015 volume number for you guys.","Matt Fox","Yeah, as we had indicated in the beginning of the year Paul that we would be intending to exit the year essentially at the same level as we come into the year and so that growth you see on Slide nine and the exit that we\u2019re moving towards in the fourth quarter here they\u2019re both consistent.","Now, there is the complication of exactly what\u2019s going to happen in Libya I mean that\u2019s 50,000 barrels a day of production, it\u2019s not going anywhere and it is still going to be there to produce but it\u2019s really uncertain as to how that will play out over the next several months. But yeah there is both internally consistent yes\u2026","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I would have thought there Libya thinking about the Slide 9 was seems to be flat. I mean was neither declining nor growing I guess?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah there was some slight growth actually coming in Libya as we increased our ability to process and sell gas there and the overall scheme of things that was 15,000, 16,000 barrels a day. And that of course is in the base on Slide nine. That\u2019s grey base on the graphic in the top of top left hand side of Slide nine.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Again I don\u2019t want to kind of spoil \u2013 talking too much at the analyst meeting. But I guess what I\u2019m trying to push towards is this Slide nine outlook is broadly unchanged even allowing for Libya and can be considered to be your outlook for volumes basically.","Jeff Sheets","Just to be precise Paul the Slide nine outlook as Libya included in it Libya just really had to predict what\u2019s...","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","In anyway you basically outperforming your expectations given that you\u2019ve kept the same number but you\u2019ve lost Libya basically, right?","Jeff Sheets","","Well we have lowered our fourth quarter numbers to reflect the assumption that Libya will just be off in the fourth quarter but we have not changed our go forward 2013 and beyond numbers and those all still include Libya.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah I have got you. Not wanting to be \u2013 on page 13 the Libya numbers are just completely excluded from 4Q because I\u2019m thinking continuing with this, it is not in either of those.","Matt Fox","For the full quarter that\u2019s right. So we show them on that slide, we show them as a light blue color at the top just to give perspective or scale. But we\u2019re assuming in the guidance that we\u2019re giving now for the fourth quarter that Libya won\u2019t come back, it may come back in the fourth quarter but we\u2019re assuming for this guidance that it doesn\u2019t.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No I understand, yeah I do. And then again, from analyst meeting your previous guidance on CapEx going forward, I think was about $15.5 billion to $16 billion a year. Is that correct?","Matt Fox","","I think we\u2019ve been seeing as around 16 as basically the guidance we gave at Analyst Day.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s the last sort of forward guidance you gave to work on this annual around 16.","Matt Fox","Yeah.","","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then I guess just a follow up simply the old questions further to Doug, which is, why don\u2019t you accelerate in the Eagle Ford. Thanks.","Matt Fox","Well the flexibility exist to do that in the Eagle Ford, we focused on a few different things here to establish with a optimum array of development is first thing as we want to make sure that we\u2019re operating efficiently and safely so that that comes in as an important factor and we want to move towards Pad drilling and we want to make sure we don\u2019t get in front of infrastructure constraints.","And the Eagle Ford, we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of the learning curve because we\u2019re continuing to see learning curve improvements and want to take advantage of that before we ramp up and we want to get results from the many pilot tests we are running in the Eagle Ford too. So we are making sure whether our investment in capital is efficiently as it can. And these opportunities are not going away so, so we want to \u2013 we think that our strategy is the right strategy for us in the Eagle Ford.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, guys. Simple quick question hopefully. Jeff I was looking at your result in the Lower 48, it looked like your [indiscernible] sequentially from the second to the third quarter up by about 1.50 per barrel, is there any particular reason why there is such a big jump?","Jeff Sheets","I don\u2019t know the details of that fall. Generally as we\u2019re bringing on some of these unconventional production, our reserve bookings are still being down on a fairly conservative basis. So you\u2019re finding fairly \u2013 you are finding higher DD&A rates on some of the unconventional properties and we will probably see longer term that\u2019s probably the biggest single driver that\u2019s going on there.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","I hear you but I mean from the first to the second quarter do you also see production increase but your unit DD&A is pretty flat, you are just there from the second to third then all of a sudden you jump by $1.50 so that seems very high so maybe that if you can some one to get back to me.","","Jeff Sheets","","Yeah we will definitely get back on that detail, Paul.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay. And in your \u2013 you indicate that on Alaska have a negative impact from the lifting I presume you have underneath. Can you quantify how big is that?","","Jeff Sheets","The lift timing in general for this quarter were not big factors. So, we didn\u2019t highlight them in the earnings release, the second quarter of Alaska had a favorable impact and the third quarter was relatively small I believe negative impact it was in order of $10 million to $15 million in Alaska where the positive impact in the second quarter I know we mentioned that on our second quarter call that was a much larger number.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","And then the company as a whole doesn\u2019t have a lot because when I\u2019m looking at your supplemental slide, you indicate that in the third quarter the total company had a overleap of 19,000 barrel per day.","","Jeff Sheets","","Yeah, that\u2019s right Paul. So in general the overall company impact from timing was relatively small this quarter we had slight negatives in Alaska and some slight positives in other regions but none of them were large enough that we felt like it made since the highlight on this quarter.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","And then a final one on I think probably for Matt, Matt in Permian it look like that in the third quarter based on the data that you gave back in that will be about 54,000 barrel per day. Are those all conventional oil production or that some of them is actually already in the oil production?","","Matt Fox","","The vast majority is from the conventional production 4,000 or 5,000 barrels a day production from the unconventional just now in the Permian really in the exploration and appraisal phase in the unconventionals. So the vast majority is from our conventional program. And that program is doing great that\u2019s a very high return programs of lots of running room there.","","So in the unconventional we\u2019re continuing to evaluate the position that we have and we\u2019re feeling good about that too.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Matt if you\u2019re looking out over the next two or three years and \u2013 Permian between unconventional and conventional component. What is the growth projection that you expect for both sides?","","Matt Fox","","So we\u2019re going to see growth in both the rate of growth obviously in the unconventionals will be a lot faster because we are starting from a lower base. But we\u2019re going to see significant growth over the next five years on both the conventional and the unconventional and\u2026","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Any number you can share say are we talking about over the next five years on the conventional side going by say 50,000 barrel per day; unconventional side going by say 30,000 barrel per day or any kind of number you can share?","","Matt Fox","","Well actually we gave an indication of this, our expectations on the analyst day. So if you go back to the analyst day presentation we had a specific slide on the expectations for growth in the conventionals and the unconventionals in the Permian. So and our view hasn\u2019t changed since then. And we\u2019ll update our view of that in our next analyst day in April. That\u2019s a good go back from that Paul.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Yeah. Thanks. Since, we are sort of on this unconventional conversation with the Permian I just want to dive in a little bit more on that I mean when do you all think you will feel more comfortable with looking at plays like the Niobrara in the Permian or any of these other unconventional plays you\u2019re testing today to actually get to the decision to put more capital and get somewhat of a development program going. Is that something that is a more of a later 2015 event or could we see that sooner than that","Matt Fox","So for the Niobrara for example with the one rig running there, we feel 11 wells with the 51 production. And we\u2019re very well \u2013 I think very well through appraisal program. This is going to run through the end of the 2014. And the end of 2014, we really know the scale and the scope of our Niobrara development and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll make the development decision where the characteristics of that will be. The same really applies in the Permian as well. We\u2019ll go through our test in our portfolio there.","Making sure that we understand which of the different perspective horizons, the Avalon, the Bone Springs, the various Wolfcamp horizons are for the right \u2013 the potential and the right place to start that development. So let\u2019s see that\u2019s probably on about the same timeline by the end of 2014 we\u2019ll have a really good sense of that\u2019s going to develop and in both of those we\u2019ll give some more guidance in the analyst meet in April.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And are your acreage positions in like each of those places specifically, large enough for the \u2013 probably the size of Conoco?","Matt Fox","I would say so. And I think that we have got 130,000 acres in the Niobrara, and we\u2019ve got about 150,000 acres in the Delaware Basin and about 90,000 acres in the Midland Basin and with multiple horizons that exist in those plays, yes, it\u2019s a pretty significant position even for a company of our size.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then one last question, on the concept of Alaska LNG project, APLNG as you all call it. Can you give me a little more thoughts on what the views in terms of getting a project, when could we expect to see those ought potentially pushing forward that and how that kind of reflects other projects coming on in the global market?","Matt Fox","Okay so the status of APLNG is that we\u2019ve selected a concept and spoke about that as you might remember Scott spoke about that maybe on the last call. The concept we\u2019ve selected. We\u2019ve announced in this quarter of the site location that we\u2019re favoring for the location of the LNG plant in the Kinai area and so Central Alaska.","We\u2019re moving towards the stage of getting into Prescott fleet so the early stages of engineering and we\u2019re in conversations with the co-venturers and with the state of Alaska on the timing of that. We did quite an extensive summer field work season on the pipeline, but this is premature to put in a timeline as to claim first production would be because there is a \u2013 there is a lot of a water to flow under the bridge. But we\u2019re focused on it, we and the co-venturers and state the focus on that making sure that we fully understand the viability of that project.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So maybe ask the question in a different way than to make this viable. What kind of size of this project needs to be for you guys?","Matt Fox","It\u2019s going to be a very large scale project because in each of the resource base there. And we think this could be a competitive project with other sources of supply otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be pursuing it. So it\u2019s going to be of pricing of scale I mean it is somewhere between $45 billion and $60 billion of capital. It\u2019s what we expect it is going to cost.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. I have a couple if I may. Jeff on the deferred tax with the start up of Norway and obviously I\u2019m not quite sure how other major projects are going to be treated like this, but can you give us some ideas to whether or not you will have a touch you\u2019re building as some of these major projects come on stream.","Matt Fox","I am not sure I understand your question, just let me try and answer if that\u2019s not what you are asking.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Let me try and help a little bit so Ekofisk in Norway you get to uplift your capital if you\u2019ve spent on the development. So I\u2019m curious just to know are you going to be paying cash taxes on some of these which are the projects and Norway in particular I guess and will you see an uptick in your deferred tax line I am just thinking about the cash flow as we move forward.","Matt Fox","Yeah, there is lot of moving pieces on deferred taxes. And if you think about how things are treated tax wise around the world. Norway you get a relatively quick recovery of your capital. In the UK, you get a very quick recovery of capital. In the Lower 48 we are spending a quite a bit of capital to the extent you have IDCs we get a quick recovery of capital there as well. So what you\u2019ll see in this year and what you\u2019ll see probably on into next year.","And then it gets harder to model as you go into subsequent years, is that the deferred taxes in general you can think of has been a source of cash for us on the cash flow statement. So far this year it\u2019s been about a $1 billion source of cash, whether keeps running at exactly the rate we have seen for the last few quarters it\u2019s hard to predict but it\u2019s going to certainly, it\u2019s going to be a positive number. So you could consider that a source of cash for both 2013 and 2014.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And as a signal, I am sure you are aware of this, but \u2013 your pure play E&P peers gets some guidance on how much is expected to be \u2013 something you might consider which should be \u2013 would be really helpful if you would. A couple of quick follow ups please. I guess is related to some of the questions of how to raise that the Eagle Ford, I would like to turn it to the Bakken place. Number of your peers have talked abtour resetting your development plans based on Q4 success and down spacing success. I am just curious about the new acreage of \u2013 going on. I am just curious as that how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward?","Jeff Sheets","Thanks. As I am sure you aware of this but what your pure play E&P peers give some guidance on how much is expected to be current and deferred on all times something you might consider it would be very helpful if you would. A couple of quick follow ups please I guess this is related to some of the questions at -- but the Eagle Ford I would like to turn to the Bakken please Matt numbers of your peers have talked about resetting their development plans based on Three Fork success and down spacing success. I am just curious about I mean your acreage is right in the heart of where all of that stuff going on. I am just curious as that how you are thinking about that going forward?","Matt Fox","Yeah that we are thinking about that Doug and we\u2019ve got some pilot test underway. Right now we are developing on a cost effectively 320 acres space and we\u2019re developing both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks it\u2019s quite possible that we ultimately will want to tighten up that space. And so we have pilot test underway to try and give us a good sense of possibly optimum spacing and what level of communication exist between the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks that for the frac that we have delivered doing just now. So yeah, we are pursuing the potential for down spacing in the Bakken.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Normal price increase the rig count any time soon?","Matt Fox","No I don\u2019t think so my comments on that are sort of very similar to the Eagle Ford. I think we\u2019re running 11 rigs in the Bakken and I think that that\u2019s the right level for now. But one of the beauties of these unconventional plays is that you do have flexibility and it is just a question of making sure that we\u2019re exercising that flexibility at the right time and moving over the right information.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks and just one final one if I can just squeeze it in. Jeff I don\u2019t want to like \u2013 I am try and front on the Analyst Day, but I just want to pick up in your comments about APLNG and CapEx peaking. I just wanted to be clear were you talking specifically about 2014, should we be, directionally can you give us any kind of feel is the how the spending should go 2014 over 2013 and 2015 over 2014? I\u2019ll leave it that, thank you.","Matt Fox","I think we would, it\u2019s going to be a fairly short period of time from now where we can talk a lot more precisely about that with you know. We\u2019re in the middle of wrapping up our capital outlook for next. And as Ellen mentioned at the top of the call, we\u2019ll be back to you with that in fairly early December.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon.","Jeff Sheets","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Hi. Just looking at the project startups you guys have Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Gumusut, Jasmine. I mean what\u2019s the I\u2019m looking at your at that I think its page seven sort of cash margin per barrel. What do you say that these projects collectively sort of have in terms of the cash margins per barrel? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of sort of what the margin uplift is going to be. I know you guys talk about it but these are three or four big projects that could have a material impact to cash flows?","Jeff Sheets","Generally what we\u2019ve looked at; when we think about everything that we\u2019re adding to our portfolio over kind of between now and 2017 that kind of mix has generally low 40s kind of cash margin to it. And it is when you mix that kind of cash margin with what\u2019s really a high-20s is kind of cash market for us right now that you get that kind of growth.","I think our views on this really aren\u2019t any different than what we had in the analyst presentation where we actually, if you recall we had a chart there that kind of plotted cash margins and production growth and it kind of pointed to kind of that same what I just said kind of low-40s type number overall. Some things like Malaysia where you get capital recovery for the terms of the TSC in the early parts of the year, you end with some even higher than cash margins as you are giving capital recovery.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. And in terms of Eldfisk and Ekofisk those in that same $40 sort of ballpark numbers?","Matt Fox","They\u2019re probably a little bit, they\u2019re probably a bit lower than that because of where the taxes are in Norway, they\u2019re probably a little bit, they\u2019re more in the 30s than they are in the 40s.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, okay understood. And then just in terms of the Eagle Ford, can you give us some little more color on a well cost and I know those numbers have been trending down for you in the last quarter. But can you let us know kind of where you are today and how we can compare that to rest of the periods in the industry?","Matt Fox","We\u2019re continuing to see improvements Faisel across the boards and our drilling cost in particular. We have recently increased the size of our frac jobs, starting in September we\u2019ve increased the size of our frac job significantly so completion cost are going up, but for good reason. And what will do the analyst day as we will give you a good breakdown of how that learning curve is being preceding and the overall cost at that time?","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, okay fair enough. And then in terms of APLNG just any update on labor productivity and how that\u2019s trending with both the downstream build out and also any updates on the upstream, any upstream issues or things to note on it, any changes from last time when the cost sort of built up a little bit because of the upstream sort of part of the business?","Matt Fox","No. The project is going well, we are about 50% complete on the upstream part of the project, about 54% complete on the downstream. And we\u2019re tracking really against the milestones that we have outlined for both the downstream and the upstream project and we\u2019re very focused now on getting ready for first production. So we\u2019re staffing up our operating and staff for that but obviously the project is going well again and April will give an update on the status of that but the projects on track and we are pretty happy with where things are going there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah, hi, John is on for Matt on the unconventionals not to be the dead horse we know you have the in fill potential with the Eagle Ford and the Bakken . In the past you\u2019ve talked about thinking of in terms of field kind of plateau levels would you rather extend the plateau or increase the rate for the given intervals you expect to peak production or place like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford or is that still to be determined?","Matt Fox","So the answer is sort of easy both and I would like to increase the plateau size and increase the duration and the opportunity said they exist in our Eagle Ford , Permian and Bakken acreages just going to give us the opportunity to do that. And that is another thing that we\u2019re going to get more guidance on but it potentially exists to do both in those plays.","John Herrlin \u2013 SG Securities","Okay. That\u2019s fair. With some of the newer plays that are kind of in the germinal stages, do you have any acreage retention issues like in the Permian and Niobrara?","Matt Fox","No acreage retention issues that we are not able to manage. So we are not going to run in to any issues of losing acreage that we think is prospective, that\u2019s one of the thing, the end points, that is how we organize our drilling schedule in these plays.","John Herrlin \u2013 SG Securities","Okay. That\u2019s fair. In Canada with plays like the Duvernay, some of your peers have had pretty high costs and I know it\u2019s early days are the costs more prohibitive in terms of getting more aggressive up in Canada for unconventionals at the U.S.?","Matt Fox","Yeah no I wouldn\u2019t say, no. I mean in fact our development drilling programs and explorations programs in Canada have been reducing costs that they have we actually seen capital efficiency there so and I wouldn\u2019t say that we are seeing that sort of pressure at all in the Duvernay or Montney while the other plays are pursuing up there..","John Herrlin \u2013 SG Securities","Okay. Last one from me as more oriented towards Jeff I guess. You\u2019ve made some very large chunky asset sales and in the future should we see more smaller type byte size sales rather than large turnkey assets.","Jeff Sheets","I think portfolio of our size you probably expect there\u2019ll always be a little bit of assets sales that are happening that could be smaller assets sales I think that it\u2019s still out there that we talked about on previous calls as whether we choose to do something to do lower our concentration in oil sands and that could be just because of the nature of how large of an asset that is for us even a relatively small change and that could be a fairly significant number. But other than I think the larger asset sales are behind us now and you will see things these be smaller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reid of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good afternoon.","Matt Fox","Hello Roger.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess but kind of melding the Eagle Ford question with the cash flow questions. I would imagine where you are on your drilling compared to some other companies your not cash flow positive in the Eagle Ford if that\u2019s correct I\u2019d appreciate the correction but maybe a timing on when you could be free cash positive?","Matt Fox","So we are today.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","You are free cash flow positive today.","Matt Fox","Yeah, we\u2019re right above free cash flow positive today.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay and all right. So that\u2019s question one the other one was, as we look at the decline rate that you\u2019ve highlighted on one of the early charts. I think I calculated at about 13% roughly 186, I think it was 1000 barrels a day of decline. What as you go forward and add some of the big projects that you\u2019re adding, some of the ones obviously that you started up are pretty traditional, but thinking maybe more like APLNG and so forth, do we get a slower decline rate going forward and is that part of the production growth uptick we would expect to see kind of let\u2019s say exit rate for 2014 into 2016.","Matt Fox","","So our overall decline rate in our base production is about 10% in a year and over the next five years. And then as the production mix changes over those years for example we drill an oil sands and we add APLNG and then the base decline that would tend to mitigate the underlying base decline. In the other hand we are also growing there by drilling unconventional which on the higher end overall decline so our expectation is that 10% underlying base decline rate is probably good buying for the next five years.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, well that was a two things, I wanted to hear. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Matt Fox","","Thank you.","","Ellen R. DeSanctis","","Thank you, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Matt Fox","","Hi Kate.","","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, I was wondering, I would like to go back to the ANs question or the ANs topic if I could, you talked about having the option to send ANs volumes over to Asia. Is that just an option that there is a one that you really diligently explored and I guess if I ask it another way, if you look out two years, how likely do you think it is that Alaskan volumes are leaving the U.S. versus remaining domestic?","Jeff Sheets","","So what would cause us to really focus on that as an option is if we saw ANs gas traded some significant ANs oil excuse me traded some significant discount, brent prices which we saw for a short period of time back when WTI brent spreads were very wide and those of course have collapsed quite a bit. Now ANs is back to trading pretty much flat with brent prices.","It\u2019s an option that we know it\u2019s out there I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve thoroughly investigating or are trying to make it happen, we know that we could if that were the case whether or not it happens in the next couple of years it will depend a lot on where ANs pricing sits relative to other periods.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","And have you guys looked at what the shipping differential is between Asia and the West Coast for ANs or have not gotten to that point yet?","Jeff Sheets","","Well I think you will have to see that ANs pricing was probably $5 or so below Brent pricing for it to make sense for us to be thinking of doing that.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","","Thanks Kate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Mei of Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Brandon Mei \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt","Thanks. Two questions for me. First one is on I just want to get your thoughts on pricing in Canada moving forward here in the next year or so.","Matt Fox","Okay I mean it\u2019s hard to tell. I mean this is going to remain regulatory, I mean weak and maybe Brandon that your assessment is as good as our assessment.","Brandon Mei \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt","Okay. And the second question is on the Venezuela ruling What are the next steps in that process and then how should we think about the timing in the amount of the award, because I think at the amount of time of expropriation the PV10 was around $10 billion.","Jeff Sheets","","Yeah, I don\u2019t think we can comment on any expectations of amount but just as far as process goes we have the initial award which sets out some of the parameters upon which the award is going to be, which the financial award is going to be calculated, we now move \u2013 are moving into the more detailed assessment of what exactly what that award is and that\u2019s going to be a process that will take a couple of years to evolve and that\u2019s just something what we are going to continue to update as we can, but it\u2019s a process that we continue to work through.","","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil, Inc.","Folks I had pumped in late in the call. I\u2019ll just limit it to one question. I was just curious where you think we are in the life cycle of a developing technology to economically develop the lower tertiary. I guess when I look at your portfolio, you\u2019ve got several discoveries, you\u2019re drilling the appraisal well at Tiber and talking with peers, such as BP, developing 20K and what not. Is it like the technology isn\u2019t quite there just yet, what kind of confidence do you have that we\u2019re going to get there and when do you think we can reasonably expect our production from the play? Thanks.","","Ryan Lance","So as I\u2019m sure you know Blake that the not all of the Lower Tertiary is at the same pressure and then the same depth. But you\u2019re right that the several paths of the Lower Tertiary are going to require a 20K trees. And that development of those trees is underway and that will come over the next over the next few years.","From where \u2013 discovery so far, I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll see production from the Lower Tertiary discoveries and hitting us until the late part of this decade, but the development market this required to make sure that we have the technology in place. But that\u2019s all in hand, then it\u2019s \u2013 I mean the development in 20K trees isn\u2019t like the man on the moon, we know how the trees work is a question of just making sure that we\u2019ve built them and getting them certified that we are confident on their deployment, but we will certainly get that done.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ellen DeSanctis","","Thanks Blake.","Operator","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","","Back to you operator, we\u2019ll wrap up the call here.","Operator","Okay. We have no further questions. I will now turn it back to Ellen DeSanctis.","Ellen DeSanctis","I have no further comments either. Just appreciate all your time and attention. You\u2019re welcome to call us for any follow-ups and again, thanks for your participation, and enjoy the rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine and thanks to all our listeners for joining us today.","With me in the room are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production.","A couple of quick administrative matters. Of course, we will make some forward-looking statements this morning. The risks in our future performance are described on page two in today\u2019s presentation also in our periodic filings with the SEC. All this information as well as our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and our supplemental data can be found on our website. And finally, I just wanted to mention that we announced this morning that ConocoPhillips will be hosting an analyst meeting on April 8 in 2015, so hope you\u2019ll save the date for that. We\u2019ll of course provide some additional details very shortly.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Ryan. ","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Ellen. And thanks to all our listeners for your participation this morning.","I\u2019ll begin our call this morning with some remarks about the current environment. Let me just say that while the recent oil price downturn seems sudden, we\u2019re well positioned as a company to respond without impacting our strategic objectives of 3% to 5% volume and margin growth. This is key and it\u2019s the result of a significant repositioning we\u2019ve achieved as a company in the past two years. We\u2019ve caught up the portfolio; lowered the overall cost of supply; and significantly increased our degree of capital flexibility. And put this last point in a bit of perspective, in 2014, our committed capital for major projects and maintenance represents about 50% of our capital and this declines to approximately 30% by 2016. I\u2019ll come back highlight that again in a couple of minutes.","Another thing we want to emphasize is that events like the recent price downturn underscore the importance of staying focused on the fundamentals. We know this is a cyclical business and we\u2019ve been here before. And certainly the old adages apply full cycle low cost wins, asset quality matters and financial strength as an asset. We intend to make prudent adjustments at this time, while continuing to monitor the environment.","So, please turn to next slide and I\u2019ll outline the reasons why we believe we\u2019re in a unique position today. This slide summarizes what we want you to take away from our comments today. The headline in the chart on the right really say it all. We have the flexibility and the resiliency to weather lower prices and we\u2019ll exercise that flexibility as appropriate.","Importantly, at this time, we do not see any major impediment to our ability to deliver on our stated goals for the next few years, and those are 3% to 5% volume and margin growth with the competitive dividend. We still believe this is a winning formula for our shareholders and we have a plan to deliver.","We have momentum in our volume growth due to the start-up of several major projects this year in places like Europe, Malaysia the oil sands and APLNG. And we have steady growth coming from our North American unconventionals. And it goes without saying we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on margins and returns. On a price normalized basis, we expect to achieve our margin targets. This was driven by growing liquids production in areas with favorable fiscals. In addition, the major projects start-ups in 2015 will generate steady cash flows for years to come.","Importantly, at current commodity prices, our capital investments generate attractive returns. And in the unconventionals, we have a multiyear inventorial projects that have a cost of supply that is lower than the prices we\u2019re seeing today.","So we\u2019re well-positioned to adjust to the current environment without affecting our overall performance targets and here is the key reasons why. During the past few years we spent a significant amount of capital on the major projects I\u2019d just mentioned. In fact, 2014 was the peak year of capital spending at Surmont and APLNG. So beginning in 2015, capital on our major projects begins to taper off.","As shown on the right hand chart with growing development capital spend, we have significantly more flexibility to ramp up or down our capital as circumstances dictate. This is flexibility we have not had for many years, but is what we set out to create when we established the independent ConocoPhillips over two years ago.","As we think about our capital levels going into 2015, we first consider all of our priorities for investment. As we have said consistently since this spin, our top priority is the dividend. This is an important part of our investment thesis. The dividend provides discipline on our capital allocation process and we believe it is important in a mature business, so no change to the outlook on the dividend.","The next consideration is affordability of capital and cash flow neutrality. Since the spin we have been consistent about targeting late 2016 to 2017 for cash flow neutrality and achieving cash through that neutrality is still a priority.","We are currently in the process of setting our 2015 capital budget and we\u2019ll announce that later in December. What you should expect is that we will exercise the flexibility we have and announce a range of capital spending that is not only lower than 2015, but lower than our stated target of $16 billion per year. Across the lower 48 we can throttle back on our less mature unconventional plays, while continuing to invest in our highest margin short cash cycle projects in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. These are the best returns on our portfolio and give us the confidence that we need to meet our volume target of 3% to 5% even with a bit lower capital next year.","Finally, we have a very healthy balance sheet including cash on hand. We think of our financial strength as a competitive advantage.","So in summary, we\u2019re well positioned for the current environment. We\u2019re coming out of a significant transformation as a company at a time when asset quality, capital flexibility and financial strength matter. We are going to act prudently, but our plan is on track, we\u2019re focused on executing that plan and we don\u2019t anticipate any significant change to delivering our stated goal to our shareholders.","Hopefully these openings comments provide you bit of insights and the context to our thinking about the current environment. But, so now back to our regulatory schedule program stepping through the quarterly results.","So please turn to the next slide. Here is a summary of our overall achievements for the third quarter. Of course this is our company level set chart that we share every quarter. I won\u2019t cover all the points here in detail, I\u2019ll leave at for both Jeff and Matt, but the key takeaway here is the business is on track. We delivered our targeted volume and margin growth for the quarter; we increased our dividend to the shareholders; and we exited the quarter in a very strong financial position with almost $6 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.","So now let me turn the call over to Jeff and Matt and they\u2019ll go over the results of the quarter in a bit more detail. And I\u2019ll come back at the end of the call with some concluding remarks and field your questions.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks Ryan. My comment this morning will be brief, reflecting the straight forward nature of our third quarter results.","Slide seven presents our adjusted earnings. Sequentially and year-over-year adjusted earnings reflect lower commodity prices. However, we saw strong operational performance this quarter and we successfully executed several major turnarounds. Volumes reflected a dip sequentially for these planned maintenance activities. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $1.29 a share. Segment breakdown of those earnings is shown in the lower right of this chart and further segment details can be found in the supplemental data, which is available on our website.","If you turn to slide eight, I\u2019ll quickly summarize our production results for the quarter. As you know, our convention for production is continuing operations excluding Libya. On this basis, our third quarter volumes averaged 1.473 million BOE per day, which is slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. We anticipated a significant level of turnaround activity in the third quarter. As you can see, we had 37,000 BOE per day of additional downtime compared to last year with 35 of that coming from our planned maintenance work. Normalizing for those impacts, we achieved a 62,000 BOE per day of underlying growth. This represents a 4% increase year-over-year and keeps us on track to deliver our 3% to 5% growth in 2014. On the same basis, this represents a 7% liquids growth year-over-year. This high value liquids increase is really making a difference in our margin which I\u2019ll cover on the next slide.","This is our typical slide showing year-over-year sequential cash margins. The left chart reflects margins at actual prices during the period and the right chart is price normalized. On a price normalized basis, third quarter margins improved 8% year-over-year. Of that growth, about 2% is from FX related tax items and reduced Libya volumes. So underlying cash margin growth was about 6% and this is despite higher cost associated with the significant turnaround activity in the quarter. This metric will be volatile on a quarter by quarter basis but like our volume target, we\u2019re on track to achieve our 3% to 5% growth target for margins for the year.","And finally, I will review our year-to-date cash flow waterfall in the next slide. Again, this is straightforward. We began the year with $6.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated $12.5 billion of cash from operating activities and added $1.3 billion from the SCCL distribution earlier this year. Over this period, we\u2019ve had about a $2 million improvement in working capital and added $1 billion of net proceeds from dispositions. Year-to-date, we have funded a $12.7 billion capital program with $4.6 billion of those expenditures coming in the third quarter.","The third quarter will be the peak capital spending quarter for 2014 and we\u2019re still on track for the $16.7 billion of capital for 2014 that we announced in December of last year. After funding our capital program and dividend, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. As a reminder, we need about a $1 billion to run our business, so the remainder will be available to fund our capital programs.","This concludes the review of our financial performance. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for an update on operations.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. The key operational message is that execution is on track across our global portfolio. It was a very busy quarter for turnarounds in our base operations and we completed these activities on schedule and on budget. We also achieved some important milestones and stack ups in our major projects, continued to deliver strong performance from our North American unconventionals and progressed our exploration activities; including the discovery of a new oil play offshore Senegal.","So let\u2019s jump in to review of our segment performance starting with the Lower 48 in Canada on slide 12. In the Lower 48, third quarter production averaged 343,000 BOE per day, that\u2019s a 9% overall increase from the third quarter of last year and represents a 25% increase in crude oil production over the same period. Leading this growth were our liquids-rich Eagle Ford and Bakken assets which averaged that combined 212,000 BOE per day, a 33% increase from the third quarter last year.","Sequentially Eagle Ford production is relatively flat in line with our guidance. As you\u2019ll recall, last quarter, we indicated growth would be flatter through the end of the year as we continue to shift to pad drilling and bring new wells on line in batches. We remain on track for continued growth into 2015 and beyond.","The Eagle Ford averaged a 157,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. This represents a 31,000 BOE per day or a 25% increase from the same quarter last year. We continue to execute and evaluate pilot tests in the Eagle Ford including single horizontal well test in the upper Eagle Ford. These tests have been encouraging and we\u2019ll soon begin testing a three layer development concept by placing a layer of wells in the upper Eagle Ford and two layers of wells in the lower Eagle Ford. The wells will be drilled 660 feet apart in each layer. We call this an 80-acre triple stack.","The Bakken averaged 55,000 BOE per day over the quarter, up 21,000 BOE per day from the third quarter last year, a 62% increase. We continued to pilot test, a 160-acre dense spacing in the Bakken. But based on the results we\u2019ve seen to-date, it\u2019s too early to make decision of ultimate spacing there.","We\u2019ve also made good progress in our Permian and Niobrara appraisal activities in 2014. In the Permian, we\u2019re currently focused on appraising the multiple stack horizons in the Delaware Basin. And then in Niobrara, we\u2019re testing several alternative well configurations and completion techniques. In both areas we continue to see encouraging results.","Before I leave down to conventionals, I want to highlight the chart on the bottom left. This chart represents third-party data that shows ConocoPhillips has the lowest cost of supply unconventional portfolio compared to our peers. This means we are at the best position to stand lower prices. And remember that not all unconventionals are created equal and being in the sweet spot matters now more than ever.","We\u2019ll provide a more complete update on our unconventional reservoir appraisal and pilot test activities at our Analyst Meeting next year.","In addition to our unconventional activities in the Lower 48, we continue to be active in the third quarter in Gulf of Mexico. After further evaluation at Coronado, we have decided not to continue with appraisal of that discovery and we took our initial Wildcat across [the dry hole] this quarter. However, we continued to be very active this year appraising our three significant discoveries of Shenandoah, Tiber and Gila, so stay tuned for more information on those. In addition, we have a rig coming nearly 2015 that will allow us to start evaluating our operating portfolio.","So, our Lower 48 segment continues to deliver strong performance. Our Canadian business also performed well during the quarter. We produced 276,000 BOE per day, which includes a 9% increase in liquids production year-over-year. At Surmont 1 we completed a significant turnaround and are now back at full production as planned. Foster Creek achieved fast production in September and is expected to ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months.","Our major project the Surmont 2 is making good progress and remains on schedule for first steam in mid-2015. This is an important large scale oil sands project that will provide steady production and cash flow in the future.","The chart on the bottom right shows the steam oil ratios for several oil sands projects, [R3] project, Surmont, Christina Lake and Foster Creek had the lowest SORs compared to our competitors last year. Low SORs are the key to low cost of supply. And just like the unconventionals it really matters to be in the best geology in the oil sands.","On the exploration front, we\u2019re continuing to explore and appraise our unconventional plays with some very encouraging results in the Montney and Duvernay. Again we expect to provide more detail at the Analyst Meeting.","Next, I\u2019ll cover Alaska and Europe segments on slide 13. Alaska average production was 155,000 BOE per day reflecting higher plant maintenance downtime at Prudhoe Bay. At CD5, the Alpine central facility\u2019s tie-in work is progressing on schedule. The project is more than 50% complete and on track for start-up in late 2015. We\u2019ve sanctioned the Drill Site 2S project and assuming acceptable federal payments, we plan to sanction the Greater Mooses Tooth project in the first quarter of 2015.","We\u2019re also progressing the 1H NEWS project. This is the third new project with initiative since the passage of the More Alaska Production Act. And in addition to the progress on these projects, we\u2019ve also signed a contract to build a new rotary drilling rig for Kuparuk. We\u2019re also making progress on the Alaska LNG project. We have FERC approval to start the pre-file process for the project. This milestone sets the stage for the environmental review required for the siting, design and construction permitting of the project. An export application has also been filed with the DOE and the federal register. So we\u2019re making progress on the preliminary work to move this project forward.","Moving on to Europe, third quarter production averaged a 194,000 BOE per day. This is up 10% year-over-year reflecting new production from the start-ups at Jasmine, the new East Irish Sea and Ekofisk South partly offset by normal fuel decline. The Britannia Long-Term Compression project started up in the third quarter and Eldfisk II hook up in commissioning activities continue on schedule for Eldfisk 2015 startup.","Now let\u2019s review our Asia Pacific & Middle East segments and other international segment on slide 14. In the APME segment, we produced 301,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. This reflects major turnaround work at Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG. At Bayu-Undan we also initiated Phase III drilling during the quarter. We were pleased to report that Gumusut achieved first production in early October. The new floating production system is running well and we expect to ramp up production in this high margin field over the next few months. This project is one of the key drivers of production and margin growth going into 2015.","The KBB project is ready for startup. We expect first gas in November, but our rate will be significantly constrained pending repairs on the third party pipeline. We expect to be at full rate in this project by mid 2015.","On a combined downstream and upstream basis the APLNG project is now about 84% complete and remains on schedule for a mid-2015 start up. This is another project that will provide stable production and cash flow for many years to come. In exploration, we spudded Barossa 3 well in October and completed the second phase of our appraisal program in the Greater Poseidon area. These fields represent possible options for Darwin LNG backfill in the future.","In our other international segment, we announced the oil was discovered in cretaceous sandstones offshore Senegal with a FAN-1 well. We\u2019re encouraged by the presence of a working petroleum system in this frontier basin and we are now evaluating further work to enhance and understanding of the play in this commerciality. We\u2019re currently drilling an additional well SNE-1 testing a different play in the area. This is a second of a two well commitment in this block. By the way if Senegal advances as a development project, ConocoPhillips has the option to takeover operatorship, so more to come in Senegal. We continued drilling our [Kamoxi] well and block 36 in Angola and we expect to have some initial results in this well soon.","In Poland, we\u2019re continuing to test the Lublewo well after a large fracture stimulation. As you know, we were exploring for gas, but the results of the well indicate that we\u2019re in the more liquids rich window. We\u2019re studying the data and evaluating next steps and we\u2019ll update the market once our evaluation is complete. In Colombia, we recently spudded the Picoplata well in the La Lu Luna Shale trend.","Finally, the Es Sider Terminal in Libya opened in late August. We completed our first lift in early September and had two additional liftings this month. We\u2019re currently producing at a 25,000 BOE per day net. We continue to monitor the situation in Libya, but it will remain out of our production guidance given the ongoing uncertainty.","I\u2019ll wrap up my prepared remarks with the volume outlook on slide 15. This is our typical chart of quarterly volume guidance for continuing operations excluding Libya. The first three quarters represent actuals. We expect the significant ramp up in volumes going from third quarter to the fourth quarter. Key drivers of this production increase of the completion of our major turnaround season and ramp up at Gumusut and Britannia Long-Term Compression. ","We now expect fourth quarter volumes to be in the range of 1,545 to 1,575, BOE per day which is lower than previous guidance for the quarter, but still achieves the full year targets we laid out earlier in the year.","The fourth quarter adjustments reflect three main drivers. First we don\u2019t expect to providing ramp gas to a third party LNG project in Australia during the quarter. This was always viewed as a short-term production option. Second, as mentioned earlier, we expect a delay of full ramp up at KBB due to third party pipeline appears. And finally at current prices, we expect to reject ethane in our San Juan Basin operations, this is strictly a value play, what we give up on rig will gain on margins.","Despite these changes, the fourth quarter expectations, we\u2019ve had a very strong year and we\u2019re on track to go production by 4% compared to 2013. Again this is exactly in line with the guidance we provided at the start of the year. And we\u2019re well positioned to deliver our longer term growth target with strong momentum going into 2015. This momentum comes from a continued ramp from recent startups at FCCL Malaysia, the UK and Norway and ongoing strong production from our unconventionals.","In addition, in 2015 with growth coming from a major project, startups Eldfisk II, APLNG, Surmont 2 and Foster Creek Phase G. The bottom-line is we continue to execute safely and efficiently and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver our strategic objectives. We look forward to providing an operational update at our Analyst Meeting in April.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ryan for closing remarks.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Matt. So let me recap a bit of what you\u2019ve heard today. First, we\u2019re on track to deliver our goals of 3% to 5% volume and margin growth with an attractive dividend. And we\u2019re well positioned for the current price environment. We\u2019re laser focused on executing our plans, while using our capital flexibility to respond to short-term factors. We have good production momentum going in 2015 and we\u2019ll expect to announce 2015 capital program, it reflects the priority on achieving cash flow neutrality without impacting our ability to deliver on our growth targets.","So we\u2019re following the plan and the path we laid out two years ago and it\u2019s working. And as Matt said, we look forward to providing you in more detail company update at our Analyst Meeting in April. So with that, let me turn it over to everyone on the phone and back to the operator for some Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. So I think if heard you correctly, obviously oil prices being lower, you\u2019ve set sort of similar volume outlook for last CapEx. Please correct me if I misheard that, but I was just wondering how much when you look at your overall program going forward of that sort of saving on CapEx is sort of well performance \u2013shale are performing to enable you to hit your growth lower amounts of dollar spend. How much is deferral you mentioned deferring some early phase shale, it will be interesting to know much you spent on that in \u201814? And then how much is perhaps the cost reduction?","Ryan Lance","Yes. Thanks Ed. Mostly in our thinking right now is mostly I would say deferral from the less mature of the unconventional plays that we have in the portfolio. Again, we\u2019re focused on our low cost of supply that we have in the Eagle Ford, the core areas that we\u2019re drilling in the Eagle Ford the Bakken those are going to remain a big part of what we\u2019re doing going forward. But it is a deferral out of some of those less mature plays.","What we don\u2019t know going into the year is how the costs are going to develop. Is this depending on your view or how bullish or bearish you are in commodity prices over the next couple of years. What I don\u2019t know is how much scope we\u2019re going to get done for the capital that we said and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to watch pretty closely as depending on where the prices level out, how long it stays there, what that cost structure is going to look like. Things will correct if it stays at $80 and we know that.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then a question on APLNG, obviously you\u2019re seeing first production around the middle of next year. When do you reckon you would get the sort of first commercial cargo in terms of us starting to sort of model the cash flow contribution from that project, obviously we still hear about delays with the main contracted out in the Queensland gas area? And then any comments on this reversion reclaim by Tristar. Would that disrupt your ability to hit those goals?","Jeff Sheets","So Ed, we\u2019d expect that the first cargo will be sometime late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter from APLNG. And we\u2019re on track to deliver that. We don\u2019t think that our production or our resource possessions going to be influenced by the Tri-Star measure .","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. And I\u2019m just I am not (inaudible), but if they win and secure I guess an access to the project, would you need to buy third-party gas from others or presumably you could buy from them and I just (inaudible) cost will be treated?","Ryan Lance","So we don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019s going to be an issue, Ed. And we don\u2019t think that that claim has merit.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Good morning everybody.","Ryan Lance","Good morning Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI ","Ryan it seems like based on your comments and I think what Jeff answered Ed\u2019s question that you guys are probably going to be as focused as ever on your capital expenditure and your operating cost control in the current budgeting round at least as much as ever. But the second part was about sustainable cost opportunities, what was your point there? It wasn\u2019t clear how significant they were? And also whether it might be whether or not to go in the supply chain or the well service areas or what have you.","And so I guess the question is, first kind of a clarification on that point. And also are you doing anything different than the current budgeting round to try and locate some of these cost opportunities and possibly capture them?","Ryan Lance ","Yes. Thanks Doug. No, I mean we\u2019ve sent our procurement group out to discover the world in terms to make sure that we\u2019re getting the best deal we can for all those services that we\u2019re providing. My comment is related to last, the last downturn we saw in this business. The costs came down a fair amount as well; they\u2019ve risen over the last four to five years. But if we stay at this $80ish world for year or two then we would expect some of the cost to start coming down and we\u2019re trying to capture those as fast and as quickly as we can.","So again, a lot of our contracts whether they are drilling rig or pumping services, they are relatively short-term. So, the reductions that should come, we ought to be able to capture them very quickly and that\u2019s our intention. But yes, we\u2019re focused on both the capital that we\u2019re spending to make sure we get as much scope as we can out of it and the cost that we\u2019re spending across the whole enterprise.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Okay. I understand. And then also on Venezuela you got file for arbitration recently. So, just want to say if we could get an update on the next steps there, the timing and how you\u2019re thinking about that situation?","Ryan Lance","Yes. So we have two sets of arbitration that are going on. The recent arbitration that we have filed is a contractual arbitration relative to the joint operating agreements we had for both the Hamaca and the Petrozuata projects in the Orinoco Belt. So that\u2019s different and separate from the arbitration that we filed a few years back, that\u2019s working its way through the system. So, the phase of that arbitration is we\u2019re both submitting our damages claim to the Tribunal, both ConocoPhillips and the Venezuelans are submitting that to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal will rule on the amount of the damages. This contractual arbitration is something distinct and separate from that that will progress through the courts just like the other arbitration has.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Okay. Thanks a lot everybody.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks. If I may kind of go into the CapEx sort of discussion again. When you look at obviously a lower price oil environment and moderating spending a little bit to bring more of that balance. How many, I guess years of that could you do before -- when you look at 2017 and beyond, that becomes more of a question whether or not you can support that 3% to 5% growth beyond that period?","Ryan Lance","Yes. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking. We have a lot of flexibility in the portfolio. So, we can -- we\u2019ve created that over the last couple of years as this major project has ramped down and we\u2019re spending more on the development drilling side, so we can ramp that down or ramp that up based on the market that we see. And to your point, I mean if we stay at lower capital levels than what we\u2019ve described since the spin, and we do that for a prolonged period of two or three years, it starts to potentially impact some of the growth, but that occurs well beyond 2017.","So that\u2019s why we have a range of 3% to 5% production growth. We\u2019ll monitor the market; we\u2019ll watch it and make sure we do the right thing for the company and the shareholders, but the impact would be longer term. So, what we\u2019re doing now with the major projects rolling off the production that we\u2019re delivering is why we\u2019ve got confidence between now and 2017, and the plans that we\u2019ve laid out will deliver on the 3% to 5% volume growth.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","So, you made a comment on some of the more, I guess, new venture type of unconventionals could take a bit of a backseat for now. Where does exploration sort of rank on that sort of pecking order list?","Ryan Lance","Well, it\u2019s in a similar bucket as the less mature unconventionals, because that\u2019s investments we\u2019re making today for the long-term growth and development of the company. So yes, we look at our commitments that we have on the exploration side and some of the new opportunities that might present themselves. We\u2019re taking a bit of a pause and slowing some of that down as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. And if I could quickly ask on Coronado, could you give us a little bit of color on your thoughts on -- I guess it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve got (technical difficulty) any activity there anymore. Can you give a little color on that?","Matt Fox","Yes, I mean the original discovery well was very encouraging, but the first appraisal well that we drilled was intended to establish what the overall size was, and that was disappointing. So rather than continue to appraise that, we feel that it would be better to direct our exploration and appraisal dollars elsewhere. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided not to continue and pursue in Coronado. But it doesn\u2019t have any implications for our overall (inaudible) Gulf of Mexico exploration program. We\u2019ve got a very strong position there over 2 million net acres that we like a lot. (Inaudible) discoveries already that we are appraising. And so, it doesn\u2019t have any long-term implications for our Gulf of Mexico exploration program.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons","Thanks for taking my question. The overall production this year you expect to basically come in line with your expectations, and we can see the growth projects expected to come on in the next few years, which is significant, as well as the uplift you will get from the U.S. unconventional piece. But my question is around your underlying and more mature base of production. Have you felt about that base this year, how it\u2019s performed? Are there any trends you would highlight or areas where you have seen improvement or you see potential for improvement going forward? Just trying to get a better sense of how base production might evolve over the next couple of years, and what you\u2019re seeing on that front.","Ryan Lance","Our base performance is virtually identical to what we thought it would be. I mean, we\u2019ve got good predictive capability on all of our major legacy assets, and we understand the decline on our base projects. So, no surprises at all across the portfolio in our base production.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons","Okay, great. And then upstream results in Canada have been especially impressive this year, especially in light of where some of that profitability has been last couple of years despite relatively consistent pricing and production. So, just hoping you could comment a bit more on -- in a little bit more detail on the evolving profitability of that business unit. Have you made significant strides there in improving the underlying cost structure and the profitability of that business? Just wanting to better understand that strength and then the sustainability of that going forward?","Ryan Lance","I think that\u2019s probably more of a factor of just market conditions that we\u2019ve seen in different quarters. The third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for us for bitumen realizations, kind of seasonal blending requirements, kind of diluent prices. All those things worked pretty well in the third quarter. So, we had strong bitumen realizations. I think you saw market prices go down by $6 or so quarter-to-quarter, but you saw bitumen prices only go down by maybe half of that. And a lot of that has to do with all the things that go into bitumen realizations.","And the other thing that\u2019s helping the business is (inaudible) extremely well. I mean the operating efficiency in our oil sands asset is tremendous. I mean San Juan for example is producing consistently well above the designed capacity. Our Western Canada business unit has had a tremendous focus on cost management and capital efficiency for the development programs. So, we\u2019re executing well as well as seeing some benefit from the [WCAS] sort of differentials.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons","Thanks for the comments.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Guy.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Guy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you everybody.","Ryan Lance","Hi. Good afternoon.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hi Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey Ryan, I wonder if I could try one to you and one for Matt. And to you, I\u2019m really just curious on your perspective on what has happened to the commodity here, I know it\u2019s a big picture question. But I guess one of the hangovers of being a big oil company is longer term planning. So, I\u2019m not expecting Conoco to have any kind of knee jerk reactions, but I just wonder if you could give us your perspectives and specifically around Libya given that you are I guess an operating company there. How sustainable do you think Libya is? And then, I\u2019ve got a follow-up more specifically on the assets. Thanks.","Ryan Lance","Yes. Thanks Doug. Yes, on the macro picture, probably a lot of what you hear is surprising how quickly the Libyans came back from zero to what we\u2019re seeing today, 600,000, 700,000 barrels a day gross production. But we sell out, we don\u2019t have any people on the ground in Libya, but we do have some national employees that are part of our company that are there in Tripoli, and the situation is very tenuous.","The one faction that took over the NOC offices, in fact bombed the NOC offices in Tripoli. So, I think that the whole Libya thing is just kind of hanging on right now. So, there is tenuous supply out there that I think is a bit at risk, which we\u2019ll have to just see over the course of next few months.","I think the demand side has been a little bit surprising out of some of the non-OECD countries in the Far East, and obviously China trying to figure out how much -- where their demand is going to come out, how much the growth is happening in the country. So, definitely well supplied market right now, and we can all speculate what the Saudis are going to go do, but I think they\u2019re a little upset with some of their customer base being taken away by some of the other country.","So, it is a bit of mix bag of things that are out there, but I think for us, it\u2019s global diversified company. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. We run scenarios, we think about -- we don\u2019t think about point estimates in oil price around run different scenarios. And we try to anticipate what we would do in capital investment, what the company the portfolio would look like under these various scenarios. So, I think we\u2019re well positioned for where we find the market today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate it. I guess my other question is to Matt. It kind of really bridges between the discretionary spending in the portfolio, Matt, relative to obviously a very competitive economics you guys have had. So, I guess what I\u2019m kind of looking at is 15% of your spending budget was laid out as exploration or defined as exploration, which I guess would have no impact on the short-term production. So, as you look at overall pricing environment and you think about the plan not to go into too many specifics because you haven\u2019t given us the number yet, obviously, but how do you think about where you would capital first and what if there was an area in your Lower 48 portfolio that may be challenged in the current environment where -- how would you kind of rank worst through best, if you like --? ","Matt Fox","So, this is really an opportunity to exercise the flexibility. And we would anticipate, we would ramp more slowly than the previous plans would be in our less mature plays. So we don\u2019t need to ramp as quickly in the Permian as we previously thought, so we could take some scope there, and the same applies in the Niobrara and to some of our plays in Western Canada. So those are the primary areas where we could take some flexibility without having any significant impact on the rate between now and 2017. So those are the main areas. But it will also choke back a little bit in exploration, but we\u2019re still committed to exploration as an engine for organic growth of the company in the long-term. So we need to be balancing a long-term view of the company\u2019s growth potential with these short-term conditions that we find ourselves in.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is it fair to describe, Matt, $2 billion of exploration, I mean that\u2019s a big cushion. Would that be the first place if things got worse, let\u2019s assume, is that the first place you would look to cut while maintaining rate? I\u2019m just trying to understand, because it just seems you\u2019ve gotten a lot of more flexibility than some of your peers. And I\u2019ll leave it there.","Ryan Lance","Yes, Doug, I mean that\u2019s one of the areas that we\u2019d look, but as I said I mean it\u2019s a balancing act for the short-term and the long-term. We\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in the Lower 48 and Canada portfolio and to manage our capital over this period without having a big impact on growth. So we\u2019re certainly not going to gut our exploration program. We need to maintain the exploration for the long-term organic growth of the company, and we\u2019re going to do that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very clear. Thanks.","Ryan Lance","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yes, thanks. I\u2019ve got some quick ones for Matt. Can you say anything else about the well in Angola, the pre-salt well? Were you seeing anything on the way down because you\u2019re going to TD that soon? And then also with Poland, can you talk at all about the test results of the shale?","Matt Fox","It is too early to say anything about the Kamoxi well John. I mean we expect to have that done something in the next couple of weeks, and we\u2019ll make some announcement once we\u2019ve actually got some results to talk about. So, it is too early really to talk about that. On the Poland well, yes we have had some tests in Poland in a more down depth location in this well, and those were gas wells, and we drilled this well in this location anticipating we would find the same fluids, and we essentially found of course really an oil well. And so we\u2019re scratching our head a bit to understand what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s some sort of thermal maturity change that we weren\u2019t anticipating. And we\u2019re at the stage of essentially conducting a long-term flow test, doing some pressure build ups, and then we\u2019ll have a better understanding of what the implications of this are in the next few months.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, great. Thanks Matt. And then one other one from me. Given the fact that we\u2019ve had prices break down, ultimately there may be more properties available in the market for the companies that don\u2019t go public. Will you at all look to supplement your acreage positions in the unconventional plays by buying additional assets or acreage to be opportunistic?","Matt Fox","Yes, we are screening land all the time both in North America and internationally. So if opportunities come up that would meet with our portfolio well and at decent price early in the life cycle, then we would be ready to take advantage of that if those opportunities came up.","Ryan Lance","And I think the earlier in the lifecycle comment that Matt made is key there, because we do have a lot of organic growth opportunities in the existing portfolio that we are funding currently.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks John.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hey guys. Good afternoon.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hey Paul.","Ryan Lance","Hey Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Maybe this is for Matt or for Ryan. First question, from a portfolio management standpoint, if we\u2019re looking at today Bakken, Eagle Ford, and SAGD, account for 20%, 22%, 23% of your production. So, from a portfolio management standpoint, Matt and Ryan, is there a level that you feel uncomfortable saying that okay, this is too much concentration or what the desirable optimum percentage of your asset mix should be in the North American onshore unconventional oil portfolio?","Ryan Lance ","Yes. I guess Paul, kind of thinking about it along those lines you are trying to hit an optimum sort of percentage. I\u2019ll take low cost of supply, which the Bakken and Eagle Ford represent, and then balance that with SAGD, which is these longer term 40 year, 50 year projects that provide an incredible base amount of cash flow with high margin production. They are a little bit different. So, really not targeting percentage, just making sure they fit the returns profile and they are competitive with the rest of the investments we have -- the opportunities we have in the portfolio, and they do compete, and obviously Bakken and Eagle Ford are at a very low cost of supply, very high returns.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","So, from that standpoint, I mean risk come also with opportunity. And so, if indeed that commodity price, let\u2019s say stay at this $80 or even lower for one or two years, will you be willing to use your balance sheet or perhaps stretch your balance sheet to make some acquisitions to even further beef up what you consider that maybe as an advantage position to be even bigger or that you will be too concerned about the balance sheet and that\u2019s not something that you would like to do?","Ryan Lance","That really just depends on the quality of the opportunity that we see out there. As we\u2019ve talked about before, we do have balance sheet capacity. We ended up the quarter with $6 billion in cash. We\u2019re going to use some of that as we go through just funding our program until we get to the point of cash flow neutrality. But as Matt said, we\u2019re always going to be out there looking for opportunities. If they make sense, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use our balance sheet. But we do have a pretty strong inventory of existing opportunities in the portfolio today.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. Two final quick ones. One, Matt, any rough range you can provide for 2015 production? And second for Ryan, it look like there is somewhat of a status quo for your CapEx program at today\u2019s price. You may trim here and there but is there a level of the commodity prices that once you reach there for an extended period of time whatever you define that and you will start revisiting your overall program and maybe consider that time had changed?","Matt Fox","So, on the production question, I mean the best guidance I can give Paul is we expect to deliver 3% to 5% production growth moving from 2014 into 2015 just as we have from \u201813 to \u201814, and then keep that going through \u201816 and \u201817. So, the best guidance is 3% to 5% production growth.","Ryan Lance","Yes. On the second part there, Paul, there is nothing status quo about what\u2019s happening today in the market. So, we\u2019ll look at that as we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility. We got flexibility in our capital program; we got cash on the balance sheet. We got balance sheet flexibility. We\u2019ll monitor the system. And I\u2019m pretty focused on cash flow neutrality.","I think we have [capital] [Ph] plan that gets us there and so that\u2019s a stake that we\u2019ve put in the ground. And again, you go back to the bit of guidance that I provided in the call here, which says next year I\u2019m looking at a capital amount that\u2019s lower than this year and in fact lower than kind of the $16 billion guidance that we threw out there when we put our plan in place for the company\u2019s 3% to 5% growth.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reid of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Reid - Wells Fargo","Hi. I guess good morning depending on where you are or good afternoon. Just a couple of other things kind of thinking about the whole cash flow balance sheet approach. You all went through a very large I guess the shrink part or the shrink to grow approach here over the last couple of years. If you\u2019re looking for ways to potentially plug an opening in the cash flow CapEx front over the next year or two if crude stays where it is. What are the other assets identified for sale, if I remember correctly you had a larger portfolio of potential sales than were actually executed. So, presumably there are still some I guess non-core assets out there?","Ryan Lance","The approach we have on asset sales going forward is just to point [Inaudible] to the fact that we\u2019ve got a large portfolio of assets. When you look at a company of our size, roughly $100 million of assets out there. But you can always expect that there will be some level of asset sales that will be happening. So there is $1 billion or so, maybe $2 billion of asset sales a year. That\u2019s probably not an unreasonable expectation.","Unlike what we\u2019ve done in the past where we\u2019ve kind of identified particular assets that we\u2019re going to be marketing. We don\u2019t anticipate we\u2019d be doing that going forward, so you\u2019ll just likely hear about things as they happen. We are going to be disciplined about portfolio management going forward but there is nothing in particular that we would identify today that we want to talk about as an asset sale.","Roger Reid - Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. And then the other question on the OpEx side, we talked a lot about capital allocation and so forth; you mentioned earlier contracts with the service companies. But rather than necessarily drilling a new well, what opportunities do you have on the operating side to lower cost if any or what should we think of to watch maybe as an independent factor for thinking about lower cost?","Matt Fox","So we\u2019re going through our budgeting phase and we\u2019re asking all of our operating units and the staff groups to take a very close look at operating cost for next year to look for opportunities to reduce our overall operating cost structure. So, it\u2019s just part of our ongoing disciplined approach to managing our cost structure but we certainly are focused on that, we\u2019re always focused on that.","Roger Reid - Wells Fargo","Right. So I guess is there anything we should think about well workovers or something like that you can always, you can defer some of that work or are there ways - I am just trying to think expendable cost something like that that you can manage down?","Matt Fox","Yes, I mean there are opportunities and probably the last place we would go is to adjust well work and workover activity that\u2019s very value adding operating cost. But we\u2019re asking all of our operating units to take a hard look at their operating cost for next year. But that\u2019s not different from what we usually do frankly.","Roger Reid - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks Roger.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi, good afternoon all. And thanks for being so clear at what is fiscal difficult time here right now to talk about the stuff. I think just to clarify a comment you made to be very clear, Ryan, I think you said that quite specifically the CapEx next year would be lower and below your $16 billion guidance, is that your opening statement?","Ryan Lance","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s great. Thanks, that makes that clear. And I guess if we were to think of what you thought of as an attractive dividend, we would assume that that would be rising over time otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be attractive, right?","Ryan Lance","Yes. We\u2019ve said over time, we expect to be increasing the dividend. So yes that -- it will remain attractive.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","And by the way, I\u2019m not setting out here to trick you in any way; I\u2019m just making quite sure we\u2019re clear here. So what you\u2019ve then said is that you kind of locked in to the major projects spending obviously and that\u2019s a very important part of you meeting your volume guidance. But you have an increasing amount of essentially discretionary CapEx over the coming years which would allow you, should the environment stay tough, to cut back fairly easily on your spending in order to balance your budget?","Ryan Lance","Yes, I think that\u2019s right Paul. That\u2019s a place we haven\u2019t been as a company that we set out to create more flexibility, lower cost of supply across the portfolio. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks today and through \u201814 about 50% of our capital is what you describe the major projects that are going to deliver - help deliver the 3% to 5% growth, the discretion, the flexibility that we\u2019re creating in the company is a lot more that capital going to the development drilling programs, both the mature low cost supply Eagle Ford, Bakken and then the less mature things that we\u2019re doing in the Permian, the Niobrara and up in Canada, Montney, Duvernay and what we\u2019re doing internationally. So, that represents in the next couple of years over 70% of our capital. So that capital is flexible and we\u2019ll manage the capital level based on the commodity price environment that we see, the opportunity set that\u2019s in front of us and the cash flows that we have coming in as a company.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","And it feels like even if you were let\u2019s say to cut in the way that you\u2019re describing already in fact CapEx next year, the volume impact because of the fact these are more frontier type developments, the volume impact actually is going to be fairly limited within the 2017 timeframe. Is that correct -- I mean very limited I guess out there?","Ryan Lance","Yes. That\u2019s exactly right, Paul. Our volume growth target is execution of the plans that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, it\u2019s the investments we\u2019ve made over last two years, it\u2019s the projects that we\u2019ve been investing in for the last five or six years, those are coming to fruition now this year and into next year. So, what we do whether it\u2019s \u201815 or goes beyond \u201815 has very little impact on our plans and our production growth targets through 2017 that we outlined and described to the market over the last couple of years.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Right. And then if I could just round it all off. One thing I think is very small, but I\u2019d just highlight is that in the past you\u2019ve talked about running with $2 billion I think of cash as a kind of working need, but you today said $1 billion. And secondly one thing that you did - is that what you just said, sorry?","Ryan Lance","Yes. $1 billion is - would be the current offering.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","The one thing did worry me, Ryan, was that you said that, you would meet your targets in a normalized price environment. Could you specify that because obviously that could mean awful lot of different things?","Ryan Lance","I think what was the point we\u2019re trying to make there Paul is when you look at cash margin those obviously are changing as commodity prices change. So as we look at the shift that\u2019s happening within our portfolio. If you just pick one price environment, no matter what price environment it was and stuck with that you\u2019d see increasing cash margins.","Jeff Sheets","So we\u2019re trying to be very transparent on that Paul. We\u2019re showing you what each quarter is in terms of the actual, but we\u2019re trying to also ground back to when we described and launched the independent company, described how we were going to grow both margins and volumes that we\u2019re trying to report back to that basis. ","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","I got you. But what worries me is when you did that the oil was - and your planning assumption I think was 110 Brent if I remember rightly. I mean it was way higher than we are today.","Ryan Lance","No, I mean - we were quoted as saying that that\u2019s not our planning assumption, it\u2019s not a $110 Brent back when we threw that out we just were using current prices to demonstrate. Here is what the margin is today. And if you track our performance relative to that, you\u2019ll see what the margin growth is doing. So, my point is the underlying margin growth is there, but the absolute number is going to fluctuate and be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter based on the absolute level of commodity prices. But we\u2019re trying to show that the volume growth is coming and it\u2019s in a higher margin than the base part of the portfolio. So the margin growth is coming and it will return to cash flow.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Thanks. I recognize it\u2019s late in the call. So I\u2019ll try to be fairly brief. I\u2019m sorry to flog the CapEx piece, but I was wondering if you could define the absolute amount of spending that\u2019s actually rolling over on a dollar basis from the major projects year-to-year? And then secondly, I didn\u2019t know if you can maybe define a level or price point where you would actually curtail spending on some of the more mature unconventional plays. ","Ryan Lance","Well, I\u2019m not sure, we\u2019ll have to get back with you on the capital that\u2019s rolling over from this year to next year, but the price has to go pretty low before we start impacting the mature plays that we have in our unconventionals. ","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay, the second question for you is on some of the issues on production in 4Q. I think you\u2019ve referenced three of them infrastructure in Malaysia, ethane rejection and APLNG. Just trying to get a sense of how transitory those are and [Inaudible] should those be kind of behind us into 1Q, I am thinking maybe the ethane rejection piece is the only kind of wildcard?","Matt Fox","So, based on current prices we would expect to be continuing to reject ethane through 2016 that we think stand just now -- and that\u2019s about a third of the variance that we talked about. On APLNG that was -- we were prepared to take the opportunity to sell ramp gas to one of the other ventures on Curtis Island, their project hasn\u2019t come in as quickly as they had anticipated, so we don\u2019t -- we were unlikely to be selling ramp gas to them.","And then on the KBB project, we\u2019re ready to start, we\u2019re going to start something in November, but there is a pipeline that runs from - once the gas gets onshore there is the pipeline that runs from Sabah to Sarawak to take that gas to the Malaysia LNG plants. And that pipeline has had some issues that need to be repaired. And we\u2019re not sure how long that\u2019s going to take. We certainly don\u2019t expect it to be repaired before the end of the year and we\u2019re assuming that maybe it\u2019s as late as the middle of 2015 before we actually get that pipeline fully repaired and to full operation. So that one will linger for a while in 2015.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Ryan Lance","Thank you Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks gentlemen. A couple quick ones, again one sort of follow-up maybe this is too specific on CapEx. But I believe that your prior targets to reach cash flow neutrality were based around kind of a $100 Brent, $90 WTI longer term. And when we think about the amount of relative CapEx that might need to come out of the 2015 budget, is this - should we think about kind of a mark-to-market on the commodity price and then we\u2019ll try to bridge that gap on a year-by-year basis from here?","Jeff Sheets","No, we\u2019re not talking about trying to get to cash flow neutrality in 2015. So, as we go forth 2015, \u201814 to \u201815, you\u2019re going to see cash flow growing as production grows from these major projects that we have starting up. So, you\u2019re going to see that cash flow growth even in a lower commodity price environment that we\u2019re seeing today, the comment that Ryan was making is we still feel like we\u2019re going to get to a cash flow neutrality number by 2016, 2017. And before we were at the higher prices that you talked about, we\u2019re at a point where we are actually beyond cash flow neutrality.","So, we still feel like that\u2019s a very doable thing for us to be doing. We don\u2019t have a number today that we can say that it\u2019s going to be this amount of capital expenditures in 2016 or 2017 to get to that kind of cash flow neutrality.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks. I wasn\u2019t implying to cash flow neutrality in \u201815, I was implying relative to the plugging the gap relative to the prior plan to keep on pace for the 2017 time period. But\u2026","Jeff Sheets","I think you are -- if you think about our $20 change in price basically which is what we\u2019ve had, that\u2019s about a $3 billion change in our cash flow. Part of that is going to come from the fact that we are beyond cash flow neutrality and part of that would come from lower CapEx.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So I guess one other question on a totally different issue. In Alaska, there has obviously been -- I mean we heard a lot of on the refining side from West Coast refiners about increasing competition as you see Bakken volumes or railed volumes reaching the West Coast and the impact on Alaska in crude pricing. I guess in terms of your outlook on Alaska and crude pricing going forward, what is the outlook, what are the opportunities that you have, I know you\u2019ve done one cargo at least in terms of exporting that crude and what sort of price differential would you need or bottlenecks in the system are there in terms of exporting more of that crude to Asia?","Ryan Lance","Well, I think what we\u2019re trying to show is we got a lot of flexibility. So, right now the market on the West Coast needs the ANS crude and we hear a lot about the Bakken railing there, but we\u2019ve got a lot of -- we\u2019ve got flexibility. We demonstrated that by taking a cargo to Asia. We have the ability and the capability go do that, obviously there is a bit more transportation cost associated with that. So if ANS starts trading well below where it\u2019s historically traded relative to either WTI or Brent then we can exercise the optionality we have of exporting that crude.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks for the help.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hey guys, we\u2019re past the hour. So we\u2019ll take one final question if you don\u2019t mind operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Thanks for squeezing me in, just one for me. As we wait for APLNG to start-up and obviously watching LNG prices fall along with crude, can you just remind us on what the off take arrangements are for the plant and any color on that would be helpful?","Matt Fox","Yes. So, all of the gas from 3 and 1 and 2 is contracted based on the Japanese crude cocktail prices. So, it\u2019s all contracted. But we have few spot cargos as we are ramping up production, but once we get to full production, it\u2019s fully contracted to China and Japan.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Ryan Lance","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Pavel. And thanks operator. We\u2019ll go ahead and shut it off here. And thank you so much everybody for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"5881":["ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 25, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen R.

My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Ms. DeSanctis, you may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","Thank you, Kim, and good morning to everybody. Again, thank you for joining us on this ConocoPhilips second quarter earnings call. I'm in the room today with Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Sheets, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. And before I turn the conference over to those 2 gentlemen, let me make a few administrative comments.","First of all, we -- you'll notice, we've provided a lot of new information with today's disclosure. And of course, that's to help you understand the business better. We've provided segment data on each of our regions in addition to some data on our Corporate statements, and I just want to let people know, Vladimir and I will be available after the call to help you sort through those details as needed. In addition, I want to remind you that our presentation materials for the call today can be found on our website and a transcript to this call will be posted again to our website, hopefully by no later than tomorrow morning.","And then finally, if you'll advance to Slide 2, you'll note our cautionary statement. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's webcast and actual results could differ materially from the expectations we shared today. The factors that could cause these results to differ are listed in this cautionary statement, as well as in our periodic filings with the SEC.","And now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan Lance.","Ryan M. Lance","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you all for joining the call today. So I reflect back and in mid-April, we laid out our plans for the newly independent ConocoPhilips and today represents our first quarterly call to update you on those plans. I'm looking forward to your questions at the end as well. So I'll begin my comments on Slide 3 and cover some of our key second quarter highlights.","Strategically, the second quarter was certainly an eventful one. Less than 100 days ago, we completed the spinoff of our Phillips 66 company. And while we were prepared for the event, it's really hard to know until that event actually shows up how things go. But I'm pleased to say that I think we hit the ground running, and I certainly couldn't be prouder of our employees. They certainly stepped up in a pretty big way.","So in addition to completing the Phillip 66 spinoff, we continue to make progress on our divestiture program. This is a strategic program that's important for completing the repositioning of the ConocoPhilips and adding financial flexibility to the company. In the quarter, we generated about $0.5 billion of proceeds from asset sales in the North Sea, and we continue to advance our progress on other assets. We still estimate that our announced program will be complete by mid-2013.","I also include a point about our unconventional and our conventional exploration program as a strategic highlight. We made progress in the corner -- in the quarter on these important activities with more to come in the year. And I'll speak about our exploration activities in more detail in a moment because this is an important part of our plans for the future, and we have a lot of going on in this area.","Operationally, the business ran well in the quarter. We achieved the high end of our estimated production range for the quarter at 1.54 million barrels equivalent per day. Key production highlights include our ongoing strong performance from unconventional assets in the Lower 48, led by our Eagle Ford development and from our oil sands in Canada. Our major projects have progressed notably, our APLNG and in the second quarter, we advanced at Train 2 towards FID and recently announced that milestone.","Both Jeff and I will cover some additional details about our operational performance in later comments.","Moving to the financial themes. Clearly, our strong operational quarter was overshadowed by weaker commodity prices. This translated to lower income and cash flow for the quarter compared to prior periods. It's important to note that our diversified portfolio helped buffer some of the impact of weaker North American commodity prices. This allowed us to generate $1.5 billion of adjusted earnings or $1.22 of adjusted earnings per share. Excluding working capital, we achieved $3 billion in cash from operations. What's important to note is that this cash flow number reflects the fact that we had a number of high margin production offline due to planned turnarounds in this quarter. In other words, the $3 billion should not be considered ratable.","And finally, we purchased 3.1 billion of ConocoPhilips shares in the quarter, representing a total of about 52 million shares and through 6 months, we've delivered on our goal of repurchasing $5 billion worth of shares.","So in summary, we had a strong quarter strategically and operationally, delivering on several important fronts. While commodity prices softened, we stayed focused and delivered on things we can control to meet our commitment for growth, financial returns and yield over the long-term.","So if you turn to Slide #4, I'd like to address the state of the business and put some perspective around the focus areas and the priorities for the rest of the year and beyond. As I already mentioned, the business is running well and that's absolutely key. We are focused on delivering our programs and plans safely, on-time and on budget. Our major growth projects are on track and these include our Lower 48 unconventional resource plays, as well as our major growth projects in the Canadian oil sands, the North Sea projects in the U.K. and Norway, APLNG and our Malaysian deepwater projects. These are the major projects that will underpin our long-term goal to deliver 3% to 5% with margin expansion at flat prices.","Aside from the major projects, the base business is also running well. As you know, second and third quarters are typically high season for maintenance downtime, but we have those activities well in hand. Finally, we continue to start our dry gas drilling and deferred capital to the liquids-rich plays.","As I mentioned a minute ago, our exploration program continues to gain momentum. This is an aspect of the business that we are reemphasizing in the new ConocoPhilips, and I'd like to give you some highlights of that. First, I should note that though I talk about exploration, I talk about it through 2 lenses: a conventional lens and an unconventional lens. And we have a lot of activity in both our unconventional and conventional programs throughout the year and in this second quarter. In the unconventional plays, we continue to test liquids-rich opportunities in North America. We have pilot programs actively underway and in place like the Niobrara, the Wolfcamp, the Duvernay and the Avalon.","We are also evaluating several other opportunities, some of which are associated with ConocoPhilips' massive land position in the Lower 48 and Western Canada. With approximately 21 million net acres, much of it held by production, we have access to some potentially impactful unconventional plays. One example that I'd like to share with you this morning is the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin. We are the largest lease holder in the San Juan Basin today with 900,000 acres held by production. We have been actively reviewing our extensive data across the Mancos', in the gas, the liquids-rich, and the oil window, and plan to test the play later in the year. Other companies are actively testing the play now, which means we are effectively derisking the play with other people's money. If the play is successful, we have years and years of drilling activity ahead.","It's opportunity like these, in our backyard, adjacent to where we have operating and infrastructure and expense, and already held by production, they are what create long-term running room for the company in this unconventional space.","Internationally, we're currently getting ready to pilot test our 11 million-acre unconventional shale position in Australia's Canning Basin.","Now let me move to the conventional side. We made significant progress here in this quarter as well. During the quarter, we spud 3 nonoperated wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. That appraisal well was spud on the Shenandoah prospect and 2 wildcat wells were started at the Bioko and Coronado prospects. We continue to build our deepwater prospect inventory in the Gulf of Mexico, largely focused on the Paleogene play. We added a significant chunk of acreage late last year and as well, we now hold more than 325 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico.","Finally, earlier this year, we added significant conventional acreage positions in Angola and in Bangladesh, and we're undertaking seismic activities in both those areas right now. So we're busy in the exploration area and we think this is an important part of the business, where we are very effectively positioning for future growth and taking advantage of good opportunities as they arise. This, combined with our 43 billion barrel resource space, is revising optionality to our growth.","On the business development side, we're very focused on completing our announced asset sale program. We have targeted selling $8 billion to $10 billion of assets by mid-2013. We have several packages on the market today. When we started this divestiture program, we understood some of the assets would take some time to sell but overall, I'm pretty pleased with the progress that we're making. This year to date, we've sold about $1.6 billion of assets with several more currently in the process. We're being patient, at date [ph] we remain committed to getting the program completed, but we'll do that at acceptable prices.","With the year half over and the spinoff complete, we have scrubbed our capital outlook for 2012. We now believe we have good visibility on the rest of the year, and estimate 2012 capital spending to be about $16 billion. This includes the impact of pushing out the expected timing of asset sales, some of which have quite a lot of capital spending associated with them. It also includes the impact of some incremental exploration spending I just mentioned, as well as some incremental investments for infrastructure in the Eagle Ford area to ensure that we're not constrained in that development.","Although commodity prices have weakened for all of industry, we continue to believe that our growth projects are robust enough to justify our planned investment at a range of prices. These are projects that will generate growth, margin improvement and returns for the longer term. For this reason, we did not think it's prudent to reduce our capital at this time, given that we're investing for a long-term value creation.","So some of the questions we get, I hope this next slide starts to address and it looks at our funding sources and uses of these in a bit more detail. So this slide lays out our current thinking on our investment priorities and the actions we'll take to fund our growth programs and maintain financial flexibility over the course of 2012 and 2013. It summarizes our sources of cash on the left and our uses of cash by priority on the right.","On the sources side, we have cash on hand of roughly $6 billion today, plus incoming cash from operations. And of course, cash from operations will vary according to price. So we expect to generate cash proceeds from asset sales of between $8 billion and $10 billion over the course of the next year and we have balance sheet capacity if needed. That consensus views of cash from operations, the sum of this column for 2012 and 2013 combined, could be as much as $40 billion without going to the balance sheet.","On the right-hand side of this chart, we have the uses for the cash listed by priority. Our top priority for spending is to fund our dividend. We believe that a company our size should distribute about 20% to 25% of our annual cash flows through the cycles back to our shareholders. Our next priority is to fund our capital program at roughly $15 billion annual level. Over the next 2 years, the sum of our expected dividends and annual capital program is roughly $36 billion. So in the current environment, we have sufficient sources from cash, cash flows and asset sales to cover our highest priority uses, funding our dividend and investing in our capital programs and modestly reducing our debt levels. We think this allocation make sense and creates long-term value for our shareholders.","Higher levels of asset sale proceeds or higher cash from improved commodity prices would give us the opportunity to consider additional share repurchases. On the other hand, if prices were to cycle down for an extended period of time, we would adjust our capital program and use the balance sheet's capacity as needed.","So now, let me turn over the call to Jeff and he'll cover our financial and our segment reviews.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. I thought I would start this portion of the call with a list of some of the key drivers that underpinned our financial and operating performance for the quarter. These are drivers that either affected our segments across the board or represent some noteworthy impact to our financials. The first is no surprise, North American crude, bitumen and natural gas, and NGL prices continue to trend lower and we'll have more detail on that on the next slides. In terms of production, our volumes came in as planned with a solid performance across our portfolio. Ryan stepped through a few of these, but as a reminder, our Lower 48 Shale and Canadian oil sands achieved production increases, which were somewhat offset by unusually heavy planned maintenance efforts and the impact of dispositions. Generally, operating costs were as expected and dispositions also had some impact on our financials and we'll cover that as we go through the segments.","I'd also note that the format of the slides we're using this morning are quite different from our previous earnings calls, with a lot more information being presented about each of our geographic operating segments. What's also different is that we'll be providing outlook information as we go through the presentation instead of all at once at the end of the presentation as we have done in previous earnings calls. So if you move to Slide 7, we'll start the discussion with a discussion of our realized prices.","About 55% of our production consists of liquids and about 45% consists of natural gas. Of the 55% that's liquids, about 30% is tied to Brent or international prices, which were strong early in the quarter and began to decline later in the quarter. The remaining 20% of liquids is tied to North American crude markers, NGL or bitumen prices. And this production continues to be adversely impacted by wide crude differentials. On the natural gas side, about 45% of our portfolio, roughly 20% consists of international gas. That's gas outside of North America. For LNG, which actually enjoyed a relatively strong pricing this quarter. And the remainder of gas consists of North American natural gas, which, of course, continues to be challenged.","On the right side of this chart, we presented the second quarter price realizations compared to prior periods. Now this highlights the commodities that were weaker versus stronger in those periods, and our overall price declined about $6 from a year ago and about $5 from the first quarter. The key takeaway from this slide is that we're -- that we benefit somewhat from a diversified global portfolio. About 55% of our mix was not affected by weaker North America pricing.","As our major projects come online, our production mix shifts more to liquids and natural gas -- liquids and international gas, and this will help improve our margins and cash flow growth in the future. So let's move to Slide 8, and talk about total company production.","As Ryan mentioned, our production was 1.54 million BOE per day, on target with our expectations. This was down 97,000 BOE per day from the same period last year. At a high level, you can see that this decrease can be bucketed roughly 1\/3 to dispositions, which Vietnam, Statfjord and Alba; about 1\/3 to downtime in Australia, Alaska and Canadian oil sands; and about 1\/3 to natural gas declines in North America, driven by decreased activities and curtailments. And what it also shows us that our growth offset base decline, accounting for over 110,000 BOE per day compared to last year. The bulk of the growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and oil sands assets.","In a moment, I'll provide more detail on production by segment, let me first give you some guidance for production estimates for the rest of the year.  We expect third quarter production to be between 1.475 million and 1.525 million BOE per day. Most to the expected drop from the second quarter to the third quarter is due to planned downtime in Alaska and the U.K. Our full year production estimate is now expected to be between 1.565 million and 1.585 million BOE per day and this includes the impact of dispositions. Now I'll turn to our adjusted earnings on Slide 9.","Now this slide shows the 7 new reporting segments for our company. We'll go through in detail in each of these segments in subsequent slides, and there's also additional information along with the historical data in the supplemental tables included in the press release. Although we operated well, our results compared to prior quarters were adversely impacted by the combination of lower commodity prices and lower production as we discussed on the previous slides. Lower 48 and Canada were affected by natural gas prices that were down more than 50%, NGL prices down more than 20% and Canadian bitumen prices down more than 20%. The biggest volume-related impacts to earnings were the asset dispositions in Europe, lower production in China and the turnarounds in Australia.","Our second quarter adjusted earnings were $1.535 billion versus $2.31 billion a year ago. Now I'll turn to the segment slide, beginning with Alaska on Slide 10.","Our legacy asset in Alaska continues to operate well and provides strong earnings and production performance. Production was 215,000 BOE per day, down from a year ago. The lower production was driven by natural gas field decline, partially offset by improved drilling performance and lower unplanned downtime. In the quarter, we completed a major turnaround at Kuparuk on schedule and on budget. Adjusted net income for the segment was $551 million, roughly equivalent to a year ago. In the third quarter, we have additional turnarounds planned, which we estimate will lower sequential production by 40,000 to 50,000 BOE per day.","Looking forward, Alaska's segment, where we have opportunities to mitigate decline from incremental exploitation opportunities, and we retain the option from some longer-term projects such as LNG exports and ANS gas. Our future developments from Alaska are contingent upon some improved fiscal terms. So next, we'll move to the Lower 48 and Latin America segments, which is on Slide 11.","In this segment, we continue to advance several high-margin growth projects across our asset base. Total production for the quarter was 441,000 BOE per day, approximately 16,000 BOE per day higher than last year. The growth over last year was driven by our liquids-rich plays in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. And then this growth was partially offset by natural gas declines across the portfolio. Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian average production in the second quarter this year was 61,000, 25,000 and 51,000 BOE per day, respectively. Our total production of 137,000 BOE per day from these 3 plays was 54,000 BOE per day higher than a year ago. So looking more broadly across the Lower 48 portfolio, liquids production was up 24% and natural gas production declined 8%. This reflects our shift in capital to liquids plays and away from dry gas drilling.","Although we saw year-over-year production growth in the Lower 48, the net income results from the second quarter were lower due to a 50% drop in natural gas prices and a 23% drop in NGL prices. This reduces net income $119 million for this segment. In the second quarter, we had a total of 31 drilling rigs, comprised of 17 at the Eagle Ford, 8 in the Bakken and 6 in the Permian. And we expect to maintain a tunnel of 27 rigs through the end of this year.","A majority of the acreage in the Bakken and the Permian is held by production and we expect to have the Eagle Ford acreage held by mid-2013. And based on the positive results we're seeing to date on these liquids-rich shale plays, we expect that we've identified extensive development potential over the next several years. As Ryan mentioned earlier, we are resuming high impact deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration and appraisal activities. We would expect to have some results by either late this year or early next year. So next, we'll move to our Canadian segment on Slide 12.","Canadian production was 268,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, up 6,000 BOE per day versus the same period last year, driven by a ramp-up in oil sands production. New production growth of 22,000 BOE per day was offset by natural gas asset disposition, natural gas curtailment from lower well performance as a result of restricted capital investments in our natural gas fields. As you can see on the production charts, liquids as a proportion of our total segment production increased compared to last year. Liquids volumes were up year-over-year 19%, while natural gas declined 9%. Again, like the Lower 48 segment, this shift can -- should start to show up as improved margins over time.","So even though our Canadian business operated well, segment earnings reflected significantly lower bitumen prices, increased WTI, WCS spreads and lower natural gas and NGL prices. As a result of these factors and given that 62% of our total production in Canada is attributable to natural gas and NGLs, adjusted net income was a negative $94 million for the quarter, compared to a positive $82 million in the second quarter of 2011.","It's important to note that this segment has generated positive operating cash flow year-to-date. So even with gas prices at recent lows, the cash flows from this segment are important sources of cash for redeploying into our growth programs. The company's oil sands projects continue to perform well with production growth from Christina Lake Phase III, and Surmont Phase I. This resulted in increased bitumen production of 20,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter of 2011. Additionally, the Surmont Phase II development and further SCCL expansion phases are underway and should lead to further production growth over the next several years.","In May, we received approval from the Alberta government to proceed with the Narrows Lake oil sands project. And the project is anticipated to have gross production capacity of 130,000 BOE per day, to be developed in 3 phases starting in 2017. So next, we'll move to the Europe segment on Slide 13.","Second quarter production in Europe decreased by 42,000 BOE per day to 236,000 BOE per day. This was primarily driven by natural gas field decline and by natural field decline in Britannia, Ekofisk and J-Block, downtime in the Statfjord and the Alba asset dispositions. Net income in Europe was $414 million, down $119 million from last year. Commodity prices held up in this segment relatively well compared to the North American markets. And positive FX impacts slightly improved income this quarter.","In the near term, we expect volumes in this segment to decline. Now volumes will begin to increase when the Jasmine project comes online in 2013 and when additional North Sea projects at Clair, Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II start up.","And one additional point, I'll remind you, is that the U.K. recently enacted legislation with -- which restricts corporate tax relief on decommissioning cost to the 50% tax rate, retroactive back to March of 2012. And we anticipate in the third quarter 2012 that our earnings would be reduced by approximately $175 million due to the remeasurement of these deferred tax liabilities.","So I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. Production in this segment was 270,000 BOE per day, down approximately 85,000 per day from the second quarter of 2011. This reduction was driven by the curtailment of the Peng Lai production, the disposition of Vietnam business unit and by the safe completion of a 41-day turnaround at the Darwin LNG project. At of -- the end of the second quarter, Peng Lai was producing 30,000 BOE per day, net. We are seeking approval for our final operating and development plan, but continue to ramp up production under an interim production resumption plan. Compared to the same period last year, adjusted net income decreased by $167 million to $789 million. This decrease was driven by 24% lower volumes, slightly offset by improved LNG prices and lower DD&A.","The second production train at APLNG was sanctioned in July and project financing agreements were signed during the second quarter. The project is on track for first deliveries of LNG in 2015. Concurrent with project sanctions, ConocoPhilips further reduced its working interest in the project to 37.5%. In Malaysia, development continues on several projects, including the deepwater Gumusut oil field off the coast of Sabah. The natural gas Kebabangan field, and the oilfields at Malikai and Siakap North-Petai. Finally, we anticipate beginning our pilot program in the Canning Basin as Ryan mentioned in the third quarter.","So I'll move to our International segment on Slide 15. This segment includes our assets in Russia, Caspian and Africa. Production was 112,000 BOE per day, up from 88,000 BOE per day a year ago. Now this increase was primarily due to the restart of our operations in Libya, partially offset by declines in Russia. Net income was a negative $19 million, driven by lower crude prices, high taxes and foreign exchange impacts. And for the company overall, the FX losses on this segment generally offset the FX gains that I talked about in Europe. As we've indicated in the past, we are actively marketing some of these assets in this segment as part of our $8 billion to $10 billion divestiture program.","So the final reporting segments I'll talk about is on Slide 20, our Corporate and Other segments. Since this is essentially a cost segment, adjusted earnings were a negative $225 million this quarter. The cost contained in this segment include net interest expense, corporate G&A, environmental cost, some FX impacts and our emerging businesses cost. A portion of the former Emerging Business segment that you will recall from the integrated ConocoPhilips, is now included as part of this Corporate and Other segment. For guidance purposes, I would suggest using a $1 billion annually for this Corporate segment, so roughly another $500 million for the second half of this year.","So next, we'll turn to Slide 17 and talk about our operating segment margins and returns. The 4 pack -- the slides on this page summarize our key financial metrics for the quarter. In the short run, prices overshadow the operational and portfolio improvement successes we've had for the company -- as a company. Looking year-over-year at the second quarter, the drop in income per BOE is primarily driven by the $6 drop in realized prices we discussed earlier. And our cash contributions and our return on capital and cash return on capital metrics follow this same trend.","And before turning the call back to Ryan to close up, I'll go through our year-to-date company cash flow on Slide 18. Today, we generated $7 billion of cash from continuing operations, which excludes an increase in working capital of about $600 million. We've also generated $1.6 billion from asset sales. To date, we have spent $8.2 billion in capital, which includes approximately $500 million of deepwater Angola exploration and Gulf of Mexico leasehold. It also includes a heavier spending on the APLNG project, and we expect in the balance of 2012. We paid $1.7 billion in dividends, continuing the same dividend rate as Caprice did in the integrated ConocoPhilips.","Related to the repositioning, the net income impact -- the net impact, cash flow impact of the spinoff of Phillips 66 was $5.7 billion. This was a combination of all of the operating, investing and spin-related transactions for the operations of what the assets that are now in Phillips 66. During the first 2 quarters of the year, we also repurchased $4.9 billion of our shares and that left us with $6 billion in total cash at the end of June, including $5 billion in restricted cash and $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the third quarter of this year, we expect to begin using some of these cash balances to reduce our debt balance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Ryan for some closing comments.","Ryan M. Lance","Thanks, Jeff. And if you could turn to Slide 19, I'll try to wrap up a little bit. I think the takeaway that we'd like to have for you all for today's call is that the business is running well, and our plans are on track. The spinoff of Phillips 66 was a big milestone for the company, and it successfully launched ConocoPhilips as an independent E&P company. Operationally, we had a strong quarter, and that part of the business is delivering on our expectations. Certainly, our focus will remain on returning value to the shareholders through our dividends, and by executing on our major projects, our exploration programs and our asset sales. The asset sales are important because they generate proceeds that help fund our high return growth projects. And we certainly will keep a close watch on the macroenvironment and we believe the investments that we're making today are going to position the company to deliver on our long-term value proposition of 3% to 5% growth in production and margins, with improving absolute financial returns and combining a sector-leading yield.","So that wraps up our summary that we had today, and look forward to the questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Faisel Khan from Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On Slide 5, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the amount of cash flow you expect to generate from operations under consensus estimates. I just want to clarify that, was that $40 billion, did you say? In '12 and '13?","Ryan M. Lance","No. The consensus cash from operations is not the $40 billion. We think per year it's in the $12 billion to $14 billion range.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","$12 billion to $14 billion. Okay, great perfect.","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, so you add the $6 billion of cash on hand, plus what we expect to get from asset dispositions, is what adds up to the $40 billion, Faisel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then on Peng Lai, what's -- assuming you can get up to full operatable capacity, what is that potential number over the long-term, assuming you can get to your, all the permits in place and be able to get back to producing in all those fields?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, I think you ought to think in terms of 110,000 to 120,000 barrels a day gross.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So net back to us is in the 40,000 to 50,000 BOE per day level.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Got you.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","And we would -- that compares to around 60,000 before the events.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then at APLNG, given your reduced working interest now in that facility and also given the project financing that you have in place, what kind of spend or what kind of equity contributions will have to -- will you be obligated to make to APLNG over the next sort of year or 2?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So what we find is that over the second half of 2012, that the project financing and the fact that the additional interest that Sinopec is going to acquire as part of the final investment decision on the second train will fund most of the -- most of our capital requirements for the balance of the year. And then we'll see lower capital requirements on APLNG as primarily related to project financing next year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'd very much like for you, your continued clarity and also, really, truly appreciate your level of disclosure that you give it. It's admirable. On the basic question of the cash flows, just one point, you didn't say anything about growing the dividend, but assume that's your aim.","Ryan M. Lance","Yes. Certainly, I think our strategic intent, we talked about is delivering 20%, 25% of our cash flows back to the shareholder, primarily through the dividend channel. And so as we grow our production, grow our earnings, grow our cash flows, that 20% to 25% is intended to grow as well.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I understand. It's actually also a very interesting target. I was going to move on to that, that the idea that you would give back around 25% of your cash flows. I guess what we're all struggling with is you mentioned that the consensus cash flows right now at $12 billion to $14 billion annually, which even arguably, I think, is on a relatively aggressive oil price forecast. So that's why it's helpful to see the uses of cash by priority. I guess what we're struggling with is the extent to which, over time, you're going to have to cut back that capital program. Could you just talk more, yet more about the sensitivity of the program and how much you could potentially cut that back to balance your cash flows over the longer term?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. So a couple of comments there from Paul first. As I talked about, the company is going through some fairly significant production growth and growth that's occurring at fairly high margins. So if you think about it, it's going from production level 1.5 to 1.6 up to the 1.8 to 1.9 kind of level over several years, that adds significant cash flow and then, as we've talked before that regardless of the price environment we're in, by virtue of moving the portfolio more to liquids and as well moving it more to jurisdictions, which have lower taxes, we're going to see margin improvements. So as we look at out over the next several years, the difference between what we're generating in terms of cash and capital and dividends, of course, shrinks over time. What we're trying to lay out for you this morning is that in this interim time period where it may not be covered then, and then we have other sources of cash to balance that gap and then we think it makes sense to continue to invest in the capital that we have. Ryan, I don't know if you want comment on where we might cut capital if we end up, really, lower price environment?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, certainly if -- so we've seen some drop off here from branded $120 down to arguably $100 reductions over the last -- through this last quarter. We still think Brent's in the $90-ish, $100 range is probably reasonable over the short-term. But if we saw some cycling down of prices and we felt like they were going to be here for 2 or 3 years, we would make adjustments to our capital program. We're doing some of that through our disposition process and -- but we've identified some high capital-requiring assets that we would like to dispose of. We've got capability to throttle back on some of our exploitations and in -- across all of North America, really across the whole global portfolio, and we would look at that as well. We want to continue some of our, what we think are the high-quality, high-margin, high return major projects. We're not going to whipsaw some of those right now, being some of our ones in the North Sea at, in Norway, the U.K., Malaysia, some of those we'd like to continue going. But we've got some optionality and in the portfolio, if we saw lower prices, we're going to persist for 1 year or 2.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think we've experienced over time too, is that as prices come down, the activity levels come down across the industry. You'll get the same amount of scope done for a lesser amount of money as well.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. The -- if I think about the relationship you have with between the SCCLs and the share repurchases, and the commitments you made essentially to buy back shares through the first half of the year, where are we sitting now on buybacks for the rest of 2012 and into the first half of 2013? And knowing what you're saying about asset sales and share repurchases because it feels like you might be in a position to actually pretty much stop the buyback now?","Ryan M. Lance","Well, we completed the $5 billion that we said we would fund through the first half the year. Our priorities have just kind of shifted with some of the reductions in the commodity prices that we've seen over the last quarter. So as we look out ahead, the asset sales and dispositions will be used to help fund our capital program. If we end up getting an increase in dispositions above kind of what we're forecasting, or if commodity prices ramp back up a little bit, then that would leave room for us to consider more share repurchase.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that saying that basically the share repurchase has stopped now?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, they have stopped.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just that you've laid out how cash flow margins are going to rise and therefore, cash is going to expand over time. Just still running through these cash balance numbers, do you have a number, I mean, a rough range? Obviously we don't know what you're going to sell, but for the CapEx that is associated with the disposals?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","If you looked at -- had we disposed of kind -- a rough range, yes, if we would dispose of everything that was on our -- that they were contemplating as asset dispositions as of the beginning of this year, probably would have taken $1 billion to $1.5 billion of capital out of our -- out of this year's capital program.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And so that will free up that CapEx, plus maybe once APLNG is got through to invest more aggressively in shale?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes. I think as we look forward over the next -- right now, we would think that our capital expenditures in 2013 are going to be in the range of $15 billion. And that includes, as you mentioned, a fairly -- a continuation of the aggressive investment levels we're doing in the Lower 48 and in the resource plays.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, obviously, as you look to the divisional disclosure, Canada is suffering, maybe you could take back in the Permian is suffering from low realizations. Apart from others, building pipes to help you get to higher realizations on the production you're getting there. I mean, can you talk through your strategy to try and maximize realization for those onshore assets?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, Ed, we're -- we talked a little bit about that in terms of the 2012 capital that we see clarity on for the rest of the year and part of that is spending a fair amount of infrastructure to help our realizations and make sure we can move the product where it's getting bottlenecked and make sure we can get it sold. So we're doing a fair amount of that where it makes sense, where there's competition and where we can get to third parties for a reasonable cost, we will do that. But we're also focused on spending our own capital if we need to build our own infrastructure to make sure that we're maximizing the realizations.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Final one for me, you mentioned the Mancos. Any other, any results you can share from them? And I do see your permitting down and your acreage down in Southern Louisiana, I mean, any results or targets that you are probing there?","Ryan M. Lance","Well, none that we would -- that I think we can disclose today, it's all a pretty competitive position. We want talk a little bit about of the Mancos because, obviously, we've got a lot of that acreage held by production. So we're still studying that and hope to have results later this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to clarify the stock buyback commentary. I think we've always thought that future asset sales, those proceeds would be used to buy back shares. It sounds like it's not probably as direct going forward, it will be a function of what cash you have available, is that accurate?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think that's fair, Arjun.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's great. And then, in terms of the -- so you're going to spend $16 billion in capital this year, you have the kind of $15 billion-ish number for next year in long-term. Does that contemplate the $8 billion to $10 billion of asset sales? Or would that $15 billion-ish kind of number come down once you're finished with your asset sales?","Ryan M. Lance","No, we think that that's -- as we look at the portfolio, look at the opportunities that, look what we've added in the North American on conventionals, we look out over time and $15 billion feels like a pretty reasonable kind of capital figure, if that -- if commodity prices hang in at kind of today's level or even a bit softer.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. That make sense. And then just last one for me, some of the peer companies in Australia LNG has had some budget increases, I'm -- my understanding is you all had more of a contingencies built into your budget. But just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing down there and how good you do feel about the current budget?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes. I know we have seen some announcements. When we came out, we felt like all along, Arjun, that 1 Train project or a 2-train project in Curtis Island was about $20 billion. That was our estimate a couple of years ago, and we're -- we haven't seen anything to think that, that would be any different. I think the, we -- I think the other projects are just now realizing what it's going to cost if the -- on Curtis Island.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel from Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","I had a few more on APLNG, if I could, please. First of all, on the Upstream program, I believe you guys are actually a fair bit ahead of the other projects that are going forward in Queensland. But can you talk about what type of a forward drilling program that you need to have to match the Upstream with the Downstream requirements, I guess, in terms of number of wells to be drilled and then also in terms of rigs that you would need to run?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, might have to get back with you on the specifics with that, but I -- we would think we're running today a 3, 4 rig program, and feel like we've got, with the efficiencies that we're gaining and the number of wells we're drilling on a daily and a monthly basis, we're ramping up the well count in front of the start up of the first train. So when the first train's ready to come online in 2015, we'll have the supply ready to go. And then we're continuing to drill because 6 to 9 months later, the second train will come online so we continue to drill and have the Upstream capacity available for that.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Sure. And then, in fact this was the logistics are obviously fairly difficult, trying to match that number of wells with the requirement that you have, so do you feel that the arrangements that you have commercially with the domestic market and some of the other projects give you more flexibility in how you manage that Upstream process?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, I think we're probably uniquely positioned there, because we're selling over 200 million a day to the domestic market today, and we've got the ability to dewater wells and throw wells into the domestic market in knots. We've got a lot more flexibility to be able to manage our available capacity on the front-end to make sure when the plant's ready to go, that we can deliver the gas to the plant.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","And then one more on APLNG if I could, please. You mentioned that you have project financing in place. Can you talk about, just in rough numbers, what percentage of the overall capital requirements will come from the project financing facility?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, the project financing that was completed was the agreements were signed back in the second quarter is an $8.5 billion project financing, so it's so roughly 40% of their requirements.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Great. And just, how much cumulative cash flow would you need to generate -- to repay whatever principle amount you have to do first and fund any contingency accounts before APLNG could start dividending cash back to you?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Well, the repayment of the financing happens over a long period of time, so as soon as APLNG starts stuff, it will start paying out a dividend.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay. So you wouldn't have contingency account funding that would have to come in front of dividend payments to the partner group?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No. I mean, it's going to be part of what gets funded overall with the project, so when we start up we will begin to make distributions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","If I could just tack on to the APLNG question. So I'm just curious, you've sanctioned the second Train, obviously, that helps with scalability and efficiency, and should improve overall return. So just curious, given the second quarter return on capital employed for the entire company at around 11%, do you think this project will be accretive to overall returns?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think APLNG will be accretive to overall returns in the long-term, but it will be a challenge to our overall returns in the near-term. And that's pretty consistent with all long-life projects where you end up putting a lot of capital on the books upfront and then you get that back over a long a period of time. So it's probably not accretive in the short-term. It will be accretive in the long-term.","Ryan M. Lance","But it is -- then the issue there is the reason you've seen us dilute from our -- are willing to sell equity to a marketing entity to purchase a portion of the project and our willingness to be able to do that and that's caused us to go from the 50% down the 37.5%, and we're looking for -- probably some opportunities for some further dilution at APLNG.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. The second question was on the exploration front. Ryan, I know you gave us a few impact wells going down on the Gulf of Mexico. I was just curious, is there anything else globally that we should be aware of that could be high-impact? And then I know you mentioned Angola, seismic, could you give us an idea of when we may spud the first well there?","Ryan M. Lance","I think we're looking in Angola the end of 2013, early 2014 for a well. We're in the middle of capturing 3D seismic. I think we pretty much completed our initial program in Bangladesh and we'll get that data in, so that well is probably pushed out. The other one I would probably point out in terms of impact is we're kind of at front end of our Poseidon appraisal program in the Browse Basin of Australia, but that will be a, probably a year-long, 5 or 6 well program.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things for me. When you did the separation, Ryan, you projected or you laid out all these projections, there was one point that we're assuming $120 Brent at that time. The margin improvement assumption of 3% to 5%, I guess, had that as a backdrop. If you have to reset, I'm guessing why haven't you reset your assumptions to what the futures curve looks like right now, and would that change the margin improvement? That's my first question.","Ryan M. Lance","Well the, yes, I know we continue to get some of those questions, Doug. I just remind everybody, we, when we came out in April and we described that a little bit, were trying to describe what current prices were and how the margin of an improvement. The important part is this, we look at the portfolio, and we look at where we're investing the money, whether you pick $120 or $100 or $90 oil or $80 oil, our margin is going to improve on a flat price basis, and we believe the 3% to 5% is coming at a flat price. So it's not reliant on $120. So as we look at our plans today, and we look at the investments that we're making relative to the existing portfolio, our margins are going to be improving over the next 3 to 5 years, and we -- the absolute production growth and the margin growth is coming. And we're investing in things that are changing the mix in the portfolio, and are changing the tax burden on the company as well.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just have a couple of other quick ones, if I may add. As usual it's -- I guess this is where my confusion comes in. It's related to that issue of mix. So when we look at Australia LNG, and that's a very large part of your incremental organic growth. I certainly had discussions with your team about this, but the implied, the IRR presented on Australia LNG which shows 8% to 10% at your internal assumptions, can you share with us what -- how those assumptions differ your cash flow assumptions, in other words $120 oil, because what I'm trying to figure out is, in the world oil price assumption was so much of your growth coming from APLNG, how does that then jive with the incremental improvement in cash margin, that 8% to 10% IRR?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So if I may, a couple of clarifications there, Doug. So the 8% to 10% IRR is not what you would have at $120 oil price. And we seem to be doing much better than that, $120 oil price. So when we talk about margins, we're talking about cash margins. So when the APLNG starts up, you're getting a significant return of, you're getting a return on your capital, you\u2019re getting your capital back as well. So the cash margins is going to be pretty robust on that project, kind of regardless of what price environment that we're in. So that those -- that will be a significant source of cash for us upon start up.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What I'm trying to figure out, Jeff, is well, can you share with us what commodity assumption does equate to 8% to 10?%.","Ryan M. Lance","That was more on a $90 tough type price environment.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So $90 per barrel, would that still be accretive to cash margins?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Final one then for me is on the disposals, the $8 billion to $10 billion, can you give us some scale of production and cash flow associated with those? And I'll leave it at that.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","From a production standpoint, like we said before, it would depend upon the mix, because there is a, in that $8 billion to $10 billion is a mix of assets that are currently producing and currently not producing. So impacts on current production are probably in the 50,000-barrel a day type range, and depending upon the mix, it could vary from plus or minus 25,000 barrels a day on either side of that. Then cash flows, I don't think I have a number that we can throw out to you on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jeff, could I just go back to your comments on the U.K. part of the business. And you were talking about the impact of the tax change on abandonment. And you mentioned a number, which is going to affect, I think you said third quarter earnings. Can you just confirm what that is, and whether it's a onetime charge? And with the kind of ongoing effect on DD&A could be?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's a one -- that is a one-time charge of around $175 million, and that just really reflects the fact that when the U.K. increased tax rates earlier, or it was last year, up to around the 62% range, they said they might be coming out later with some restrictions on how much you could deduct on abandonment obligations. What they've done that now, and said that only 50 -- you only get 50% tax relief on abandonment obligations. That mark of our deferred tax liability down to reflect that change is what the $175 million should be. So it's to be a onetime special item type event in the third quarter.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And there won't any kind of ongoing effect on your DD&A per barrel rate?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","There could be some, no, no, no, there isn't, because it's just -- that's just a -- that's a before tax item.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And secondly, on NGL pricing, there's going to be a fair amount of investments in infrastructure, et cetera. I just wanted to -- when you look at these very depressed prices you're getting in the Lower 48, how long you expect those to have such a big margin to oil prices going forward? And whether you've thought about any sort of hedging program, for that? Obviously, it's not great to under hedge now, but whether that's something we should might want to look to protect in the future?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So NGLs, as we've pointed out, are around, globally, about 9% of our production and the Lower 48 and Canadian portion of that is like 6% or 7% of our production. As we look across over time, if you roll the clock forward several years, our NGL production, we would anticipate to be relatively flat and with our growth is going to be coming from crude oil production. So we don't have increasing exposure to NGLs going forward. I think we see that the market is going to be fairly soft, particularly for ethane in the near term, which is what's really driving down the overall price of NGLs. And -- but that will get solved with all the capacity expansions that you're hearing, talked about in the chemicals side of the business right now. So we don't think it's a long-term phenomenon, but that kind of low NGL price is going to attract additional investments.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last one, I'm going to go back to APLNG, I'm afraid, the other guys have announced big increases, also talked about the translation effects of the Aussie dollar, and I presume, that when you launch this project, you were looking at a much lower level of the Aussie dollar versus U.S. dollar. So is that -- does that $20 billion budget you have, do you cover this kind of big increase in Aussie dollar exchange rates? Because I believe that's a very substantial portion of the overall CapEx is denominated in local currency?","Ryan M. Lance","It is. I mean, that number reflects our current estimates with the way the market looks now on the Australian dollar, but -- and that continues to be, like with the other projects, that continues to be one of the larger exposures we have on the project is, is if there is a further weakening of the U.S. seller relative to the Aussie dollar.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So is it fair to say you've probably used up all contingency you had initially on that project?","Ryan M. Lance","No, I wouldn't say that. I'd say that we feel like the numbers that we had out there now still has contingency in them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I want to echo to early comment that wanted to thank you for the expand disclosure, very helpful and I appreciate it. But just one possible request, that since that you're going to break out the earnings by different regions, can you also break out your exploration expense in the future by the corresponding region? That would be helpful in the modeling. And that, Ryan, in your presentation that you give the production and the margin improvement target, do you have a proven reserve growth target?","Ryan M. Lance","Yes, certainly, Paul, we expect, over time to be more than replacing the production. So we haven't come out and said exactly what it is, but it's -- clearly targets over 100%. It'll be lumpy and there'll be years when it probably dramatically exceeds it, and years when it will be right at it.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Should we assume that you were trying to hold your RDP rates flat, or were -- that's not really a target?","Ryan M. Lance","I don't think about, Paul, trying to hold RDP flat. In fact, as we shift our investments in some of these higher-margin, the profile of the some of these investments, I actually expect our RDP will go down a little bit over time, not a lot or not, but will trend down versus trying to trend flat.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Jeff, on the asset sale, I just want to clarify that. $8 billion to $10 billion -- does it, for 2012 and '13, does it already include the $1.6 billion year-to-date and also the expected farm down of the -- on the APLNG?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So we do include -- we think about that number as a 2012 and 2013 number. The farm down on APLNG ends up being a contribution into the joint venture, so it's not an asset sale, so.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, so APLNG is not included, but the $1.6 billion year-to-date is included?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's correct.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And since I've got you, Jeff, that I think you guys have an open leak [ph] in the second quarter around 29,000-barrel per day. What region that if it's -- come from? And also as of the end of June 30, you guys balance or still net overweight? Open leaks [ph]?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Paul, we'll have to get back to you on that. I don't have that right in front of me.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","We'll get back to you, Paul.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","This is Guy Baber here in for Jeff. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about current and planned activity levels and what you're seeing in the Permian basin? And specifically wondering if you had any update with respect to pilot programs in the Avalon and the Wolfcamp? Any comments there will be appreciated.","Ryan M. Lance","Well, we, yes, we've got quite a bit of activity going on as Jeff described earlier, we have 6 or 7 rigs running in the Permian basin and those are all targeting some of the existing conventional opportunities that we have. But largely focused on the unconventionals. It's mostly liquids investments in all of the Permians, so we're active in piloting and drilling both the Wolfcamp and some of the other plays in the Permian basin. So yes, we're pretty active there right now.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then also, I had a strategic portfolio management type of question, but Ryan, as you look at the existing portfolio, are there any gaps or areas where you're lacking exposure now that you would like to enhance your position? And then relatedly, internationally, the focus has largely been on OECD geographically for one at risk, and that's worked well for you all. And should we assume that that remains the case going forward? And that would -- would that preclude you from potentially entering some of these international plays that may offer significant long-term resource potential, but do carry a higher risk profile? And I'm thinking of some plays like East Africa for one, or even Kurdistan region of Iraq, any comments there will be appreciated.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Well, I mean, as I look at the portfolio, I'd say we're more after low-cost to supply opportunities, whether that's gas or oil, where we can make a competitive rate of return within our portfolio. As I look at that today, you see are heavily focused on unconventionals in North America because we see a lot of opportunity that are working well. We've got a great position, and so, large part of our investments are going there. But internationally, I'd say as we've -- as you see from our exploration, we're growing our deepwater position, and that's not only in the Gulf of Mexico, but also Angola and the subsalt opportunity there, Bangladesh, we're offshore Sabah island in Malaysia, so you'll see some things that we're doing in the deepwater. We think the liquids-focused deepwater investments make a lot of sense. So I think as we think about it, going around, it's really opportunity by opportunity but looking for a good low-cost to supply and looking for areas. So even playing the Barents Sea in Norway makes sense to us right now, and you've seen us capture some acreage positions up there. So I, we -- in terms of holes, don't think we have a hole that we're really trying to plug. We're just really focused on value and focused the returns and making sure that what we do go after and capture competes well within our existing portfolio. As you said, we're largely OECD today, so we can take on a little bit more risk in terms of political risk and something like that if we think the returns are going to be competitive.","Ellen R.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, the Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","Thank you so much, Sherry and of course thank you to our listeners for joining this second quarter earnings call. I\u2019m joined in the room today by Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and CFO; and Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production.","It\u2019s a very busy day for earnings activity. I know all of you are pressed for time. So we\u2019re going to jump right into the material today really quickly before we get started. If you would please turn to Page 2 you will see our Safe Harbor statement. That of course described the risks and uncertainties in our future performance. Those are also described in our periodic filings with the SEC.","I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Ryan now.","Ryan Michael Lance","Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. Well, it\u2019s been just over a year since we launched the independent ConocoPhillips as a new class of investment. We\u2019ve laid out a plan that would deliver growth and volumes and margins with a compelling yield. I think as you\u2019re all hear and see today the key pieces of our strategy are falling into place.","For the second quarter in a row, organic volumes net of dispositions and planned downtime are growing. Margins are improving. We\u2019re maintaining our commitment to a compelling dividend reflecting our confidence in our plans and our financial position remained strong. So the theme of today\u2019s call is pretty simple. We are successfully executing on our business plan. We\u2019re doing what we said we would do. We continue to keep our eye on the ball and the top priority for of all of us at ConocoPhillips is to operate safely and execute our plans and programs.","So let\u2019s get started on Slide 4. Operationally our business performed very well this quarter. We produced 1.552 million BOE per day on a total company basis and 1.51 million BOE per day on a continuing operations basis.","Adjusted for dispositions and planned downtime, this represents 4% organic growth compared to a year ago. Last quarter we grew 2% on the same basis. So the organic growth is showing up in our performance.","This quarter\u2019s volume performance exceeded the high end of our guidance range and this is primarily due to two things; better than expected performance at Eagle Ford in our Europe and Asia Pacific regions and our seasonal maintenance and planned downtime was executed ahead of plan. Based on this quarter\u2019s stronger than expected volume performance we\u2019re raising our third quarter and full year volume guidance, which Matt will cover in more detail.","As you know, the second quarter was a very active period for planned maintenance and we successfully executed key turnarounds. That\u2019s essential to projecting our base assets. In addition, our development activities also have performed well this quarter. And remember, these are lower risk programs with years of inventory that completely mitigate our base decline. Of these, the Eagle Ford stood out in the second quarter. Production averaged more than 120,000 BOE per day, almost double last year\u2019s second quarter rate and up 20% sequentially.","Our major growth projects are also on track. These are projects that will generate step-function growth during the next several quarters and years and we have several near-term startups that Matt will also describe in detail. So operationally, we are hitting the milestones we set for ourselves.","Now moving to the financial results, adjusted earnings were about $1.8 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings were up 17% year-over-year. Excluding working capital, we generated $4.4 billion in cash from continuing operations and ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash in short-term investments.","On a year-to-date basis, our cash from continuing operations plus our proceeds from asset sales have covered our dividend and capital programs.","Cash margins grew compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, reflecting the impact of product mix, prices and location and strategically this is one of the keys to achieving our value proposition is high-grading our portfolio by selling non-strategic assets and redeploying those proceeds into organic investments that will drive future growth and we\u2019re making good progress on our announced divestiture program. Since the beginning of this year, we\u2019ve received approximately $1.7 billion in proceeds from asset sales and we expect to close Algeria, Nigeria and Kashagan by year-end. These would add approximately $9 billion of additional proceeds in 2013.","As we previously discussed, our portfolio efforts will now shift to improving and rebalancing the asset base. We\u2019ll take opportunities to divest the smaller non-strategic assets such as southwest Louisiana conventional assets that we sold in the second quarter. And we\u2019ll also look for ways to rebalance our interest and assets like the oil sands. These are great assets, but one where we believe we\u2019re bit overweighted in our portfolio today.","At the same time, we\u2019re monetizing assets. We\u2019re also adding to our conventional and unconventional exploration inventory globally and we\u2019re running this program at a high level of activity. Exploration success like we\u2019ve recently seen at Coronado and Shenandoah is key to sustain any organic growth longer terms.","Despite this high level of activity, our 2013 capital outlook is relatively unchanged. We expect to spend about $15.9 billion on continuing operations and $600 million in discontinued operations. That\u2019s a total of $16.5 billion which is an increase of about 4% compared to our announced total company budget. Of this 4% increase, about half reflects our updated expectations around completing the sales of Algeria, Nigeria and Kashagan.","So this is capital that will come back to us as adjustments at closing. The remainder of the increase are about 2%, reflects various adjustments across our asset base including high quality additions to our exploration portfolio.","Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Right after the quarter ended, we increased our dividend by 4.5%, reflecting confidence in our growth plans and we have remained committed to consistent dividend increases over time.","So in summary, we have a strong quarter operationally, financially and strategically. So next you\u2019ll hear from Jeff and Matt who will give you all the details. So if you please turn to Slide 5 and let Jeff begin his comments on our financial performance.","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Thank you, Ryan. This quarter\u2019s adjusted earnings were $1.75 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. This was above consensus, driven primarily by the higher than expected volumes that Ryan just mentioned. Second quarter adjusted earnings were up 17% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter and on an earnings per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 19%, reflecting the impact of our 2012 share repurchases.","The year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was primarily driven by higher margins. The higher margins reflect the continued shift to higher-value liquids in the portfolio as well as the shift to more favorable fiscal machines. Average realized prices were flat and total company volumes were up modestly.","Now I\u2019ll cover our production performance for the quarter. So if you\u2019ll turn to Slide 6. Total company production in the second quarter was 1.552 million BOE per day. These results included 42,000 BOE per day from discontinued operations. This chart shows the change in both continuing and discontinued operations compared to the second quarter 2012, but I\u2019ll focus on the continuing operations.","Second quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.48 9 million BOE per day. Adjusting for dispositions of 33,000 BOE per day, normalized production from continuing operations was 1.456 million BOE per day in last year\u2019s second quarter and that\u2019s the middle blue bar on the chart.","During the second quarter of 2013, planned downtime was 10,000 BOE per day higher than last year\u2019s second quarter, which was mostly due to downtime in the North Sea.","Growth of 219,000 Boe per day more than offset decline of 155,000 Boe per day. So normalized for 2012 dispositions and planned downtime, our production from continuing operations increased by 64,000 Boe per day, which I will explain more in the next slide.","Year-over-year this represents a 4% organic growth and the second consecutive quarter on this upward trend. So let me take a moment and talk about cash margin trends on slide 7 and 8, starting with contributions from our production growth.","So this chart on slide 7 is a new one, it shows how our second quarter growth and changing mix drove cash margin improvement compared to last year. As I just mentioned, volumes from our continuing operations were up 64,000 Boe per day year-over-year, adjusted for dispositions and planned downtime. This chart shows the change in this quarters volumes by segment and product compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.","So as you can see the relative growth which is shown in the green bars is primarily from higher value of liquids. In addition, it\u2019s occurring in areas with more favorable fiscal terms in the company average, and this isn\u2019t by accident as we are focused on shifting our portfolio and our investments to places with higher margins and better returns.","Normal fuel declines in Alaska, Europe and North America natural gas somewhat offset the growth. The impact of the shift on our cash margins can be seen on the next slide, slide 8. This slide shows sequential and year-over-year cash margins both on a reported basis and a price normalized basis.","As you can see on the chart on the left cash margins grew on a reported basis, despite flat overall realized prices compared to the last year\u2019s second quarter. In terms of prices we generally saw North America natural gas prices being offset by decreases in Brent crude prices. So the chart on the left reflects the impact of product mix, prices in location, and you can see this from the chart the cash margins grew both sequentially and year-over-year. But the right side of this chart shows, this is an estimate of what our cash margins would have been, if we had the same pricing in all quarters and we have used the second quarter of 2012 at the baselines, that\u2019s pricing $93 at WTI, $108 Brent, and $2.20 Henry Hub.","You can see that on this price normalized basis, the cash margins grew significantly year-over-year and also grew sequentially. So this metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, we expect this trend to continue as we shift our production towards higher value products in places with more favorable fiscal terms. We will continue to periodically track and report this metric as growing both production and margins is a key aspect of our value proposition.","So now I will turn to the segment slide, beginning with Lower 48 on slide 9. Production in this segment was 491,000 BOE per day, that\u2019s up 11% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter and up 3% sequentially. We saw this improvement despite the sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline assets in the first quarter of 2013.","Total liquids production in the segment increased 20% compared to the same period a year ago and now represents 48% of the total mix for the segment and we expect our liquids percentage to continue to grow.","During the quarter, combined production from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian Basin averaged 203,000 BOE per day and that\u2019s up 47% from a year ago. These assets made up less than 9% of our total company production a year ago and today these assets comprise 13% of our total company production and we expect they will continue to grow.","Segment adjusted earnings this quarter generally reflects higher realized prices compared to the same period a year-ago, but they also include the foreign dry hole costs and leasehold impairment of approximately $70 million after-tax. Excluding that charge, segment adjusted earnings would have been almost $250 million as you can see the leverage and earnings due to the growth and the shift to liquids.","Now, let\u2019s cover the Canada segment on Slide 10. Production in this segment is $271,000 BOE per day, roughly flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. Liquids grew 12% year-over-year while gas production declined 9%. The shift has increased segment margins, which continue to improve margins overtime. Production was impacted in the second quarter by 9,000 BOE per day as a result of planned downtime at Christina Lake. Canada\u2019s adjusted earnings of $5 million this quarter reflects stronger product pricing compared to last year and sequentially. And as a reminder, the WCS prices in our supplemental information represents one month lag, which better reflects our pricing for Bitumen.","Now, let\u2019s move to the Alaska segment on Slide 11. Production in Alaska was 197,000 BOE per day, this quarter, this was down sequentially due to planned downtime at Kuparuk and Prudhoe and normal field decline. But despite lower sequential volumes, adjusted earnings were $585 million this quarter, which is up compared to last quarter. Differences between the timing of production and sales explain much of the variance; the first quarter of this year included an adverse impact earnings of approximately $50 million from these lift timing impacts while this quarter included the benefit of about $25 million, a positive swing of $75 million.","We continue to analyze the impact to our business related to the recent passage of Senate Bill 21 and we expect to pursue additional opportunities for investment over time.","I'll turn now to Slide 12 and talk about our Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment. Production in this segment was 324,000 BOE per day during the second quarter, up 20% compared to year ago and up 2% sequentially. Key drivers of year-over-year performance were the resumption of normal production and growth at Bohai Bay, growth at the Panyu project in China, and early production from Gumusut in Malaysia, which started late last year. Adjusted earnings this quarter were unfavorably impacted by weaker prices and impacts from lift timing are minimal this quarter.","Europe, the next segment is found on Slide 13. Production for the Europe segment was 173,000 BOE per day during the quarter, a decrease of 34,000 BOE per day sequentially. This was driven by significant downtime in Greater Ekofisk area in Norway and the J-Area in the UK.","Compared to a year ago lower production is driven by higher planned and unplanned downtime, normal field declines, and dispositions. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $261 million, and segment performance should improve when major projects startup occur in the UK and Norway.","Before I wrap up, the financial section of today's call, with the discussion of cash flow, let me provide an update on our corporate segment. Our corporate segment adjusted earnings were negative $164 million in the quarter. We are updating our annual guidance for this segment to be $750 million after-tax, that's an $150 million improvement compared to our prior guidance.","Additional information for the corporate segment and the other international segments are included in the supplemental information that we provided with the earnings release.","We turn to Slide 14, I'll cover our year-to-date company cash flow waterfall. Through the first half of 2013 we\u2019ve generated $8 billion in cash from continuing operations excluding working capital. Through June working capital was a better wash for the year.","Year-to-date we\u2019ve generated $1.7 billion in proceeds from dispositions primarily from the sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline assets and partial working interest in the Browse and Canning Basin. So far we\u2019ve funded $7.5 billion capital program for continuing operations and paid out $1.6 billion in dividends. Note that cash flow from operations and proceeds from dispositions have covered our dividend and capital program.","The $1.3 billion in debt and other reflects the repayment of approximately $900 million of debt at maturity during the quarter, as well as capital associated with the discontinued operations. Now something to note, although we paid down $900 million in debt during the quarter, our debt balance was unchanged as we recorded $900 million capital lease obligation for the Gumusut Floating Production System. We have $4 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand, which is just slightly lower than where we started the year.","So in summary, our balance sheet and financial position remains strong and we believe are well positioned to execute our investment programs and our value proposition for the company.","I will now turn the call over to Matt for an update on operations beginning on Slide 15.","Matthew J. Fox","","Thank you, Jeff. As both Ryan and Jeff mentioned, the main theme of this quarter\u2019s operational performance is that we are on plan just like last quarter. So I am going to cover the operations material by our capital categories beginning with our high-quality base assets. And as a reminder, our base assets refer to the assets that we\u2019re producing at the end of last year.","In June, the second quarter these base assets performed very well across all of our operations and with minimal unplanned downtime. So that means on average everything ran back better than expected because in our forecast we actually assume some unplanned downtime.","We protect the operating integrality of our base assets through plant maintenance. As we discussed in the previous quarter call we have significant plant maintenance and tie-in scheduled for the second and third quarters of this year. And our operated assets (inaudible) minority the downtime of 30% higher than our five year historical average.","The chart in the lower left shows the major planned events for 2013 and their duration. As you can see many projects commenced later in the second quarter and a couple of these are still underway and others are scheduled to start in the third and fourth quarters.","And now a few highlights; in the North Sea turnarounds were successfully completed ahead of schedule at Ekofisk, Eldfisk in the J-Area. These activities included tie-ins for the major projects Ekofisk South, Eldfisk II and Jasmine. Turnarounds in the Lower 48 were successfully completed as well as the planned maintenance at Christina Lake. We have additional planned downtime scheduled during the third and fourth quarters in Alaska, the UK, Foster Creek and Qatar.","So our base operations are running well and our turnarounds are on or ahead of schedule.","Moving on to our development programs on page 16, these development programs consists of lower risk drilling lead activities around the world, that completely mitigate our base declines in generally higher margins and attractive returns. These programs remain on track to deliver about 600,000 Boe per day of production by 2017 as shown in the top left graphic.","Our legacy conventional field development programs are on track. For example, in places like the Kuparuk field in Alaska, coiled tubing drilling sidetracks continued in the second quarter. In Western Canada, we continue to see good results from margin enhancing drilling programs and the liquids rich plays we are focusing on.","Results across our Lower 48 development programs are very strong. They produce 491,000 BOE per day in the second quarter and a high level of drilling activity continues.","A couple of highlights; Bakken produced an average of 30,000 boe per day, up 15% compared to the first quarter last year and up 3% sequentially. Heavy rains and flooding in the area impacted our second quarter activity, but we are getting back on track with 11 rigs running.","The Eagle Ford exceeded our expectations in the second quarter. Production averaged 121,000 boe per day, almost double the same period last year and up 20% sequentially.","During the second quarter, we brought on 65 operated wells including catching up on some of the well backlog we have. And we continue to believe that our Eagle Ford position is truly best-in-class. The charts on the lower left of this slide shows third-party data on our well performance compared to the top competitors in the fleet.","We are one of the top producers overall and we are producing higher oil volumes per well; more than 50% higher than the competitor average, so clearly we\u2019d identified the sweet spot when we established our position for only $300 an acre.","We are currently running 11 rigs in the fleet. We are on track to complete the drilling Phase of acreage capture this year and we are transitioning to multi-well pad drilling for our more than 1900 remaining identified locations.","Now I would like to discuss our major projects on slide 17. Our major projects remain on track to deliver about 400,000 boe per day of production by 217, as shown on the top left graph.","Our oil sands assets are performing as planned. The combined oil sands properties averaged 100,000 BOE per day during the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Currently, we have seven major oil sands projects in execution and these projects are progressing on schedule.","Christina Lake Phase E started up in mid-July slightly ahead of schedule, and we should ramp to about 20,000 BOE per day net from Christina E within six to nine months. Our (inaudible) project is about 40% complete by the end of July and is on track to start up in the early 2015.","In Alaska, our CD5 project is on track and we are progressing engineering work and additional satellite projects for sanction in 2014. The passage of SB21 in Alaska, we believe some of our Alaska projects and (inaudible) viable and we expect to invest more capital in Alaska over time.","In Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment, our major projects are also on plan. Performance from our pioneer growth project is running ahead of expectations. We have 23 wells on line at the end of June, versus 19 planned. And these wells contributed about 7,000 BOE per day net and second quarter.","In Malaysia, key load outs and less were achieved during the quarter. The floating production system from Gumusut is now in place, Siakap North-Petai project is on track, and we expect production from both projects to begin ramping up at year-end.","At Curtis Island, module installations continue to APLNG during the second quarter. In June, we raised the width of our first tank, a big milestone for the project. We're still on schedule for first LNG in 2015.","Activity at both the UK and the region sectors of the North Sea is very high.","At Ekofisk, so we installed a new project topside facilities during the second quarter and the project is on track to achieve cost reduction by the end of 2013. Also during the quarter, we installed the jackets and bridges at Eldfisk II in preparation for first oil late next year.","At Jasmine, key installations were completed in the second quarter and offshore hook-up and commissioning market is fully underway. Cost reduction from Jasmine is expected early in the fourth quarter. The graphic on the lower left shows the expected production start-ups during the third and fourth quarter of this year and as you can see the projects we have been talking about for a while are now coming to fruition and we have more projects scheduled to startup next year including Eldfisk II in the North Sea, Kakap in Malaysia, additional phases of the oil sands, Britannia long-term compression and (inaudible) project in Indonesia. So the delivery of new production from major projects will start later this year and continue through 2014 and beyond.","Next I want to briefly cover our exploration programs starting in slide 18. Our exploration momentum continues on several fronts. We are building inventory of both conventional and unconventional opportunities. We are advancing several opportunities to the drill ready stage and we are currently drilling several operated and non-operated prospects.","There is a very high level of activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico program. The lower (inaudible) is currently drilling. We have 30% interest in this well. During the quarter, we acquired 20% working interest in the (inaudible)` prospect and the six plus heal at JOE. This is a very large prospect that\u2019s also currently drilling and should reach TV this quarter and we have additional 100% ConocoPhillips leases within the healer structure, so this is an important well for us.","The Deep Nansen wildcat and Tiber appraisal wells are expected to spud this quarter and we have a 25% and 18% working interest in these wells respectively.","In the Browse Basin of Australia we are currently drilling the Proteus wildcat on an untested structure to the Southeast of the Poseidon discovery and we expect to reach TD soon. We completed our sale of partial interest in the Browse and Canning Basin in June as well. Recall, this was part of a deal to gain access to potential shale opportunities in the Sichuan Basin in China.","In Europe we were awarded one operatorship and three partnership licenses in Norway\u2019s 22 licensing round in the Bering sea and this represents attractive future conventional inventory in a legacy area for the company and we expect to start testing our acreage in the Bering\u2019s in 2014.","In the Kwanza Basin in Angola, we completed our 2013 3D seismic acquisition program in early April. Also, we recently acquired an additional 20% working interest in Block 36 bringing our equity to 50%. We also have 30% interest in Block 37 and we\u2019re still planning more to begin drilling early next year. In addition, we\u2019ve completed a fireman to three offshore blocks in Senegal. These blocks provide attractive acreage to test the West African (inaudible) play and drilling on these blocks will start next year too.","Globally we have activities under way in several unconventional plays. We expect to be drilling in Poland and Colombia by year-end. We also continue to drill on plays, the Duvernay and Montney plays in Canada and we continue to test plays in the Permian and Niobrara in the Lower 48.","That was a pretty quick overview of our operations and exploration activity. The key takeaways are less. The operations are running well, the development programs are delivering, the startups of several growth projects are eminent and we\u2019ve got level of exploration activity.","I\u2019ll wrap up my comments on Slide 19 with a quick review of our 2013 production outlook. As Ryan mentioned in his opening comments, we are raising our production outlook for 2013. This slide shows our actual 1Q and 2Q volumes and our forecast volumes for the rest of the year on both the continuing and discontinued operations basis.","The bottom line, we are tightening our ranges in 3Q and 4Q and we are bringing up the midpoint of a full year range by about 20,000 BOE per day just over 1%.","As you can see, we expect third quarter volumes to be lower than second quarter, driven again by significant turnaround in maintenance activities, in this case dominated by Alaska and the UK. Fourth quarter volume should ramp up from there as our planned downtime (inaudible) and our major projects ramped up and we should see a strong exit rate going into 2014.","Now please come to Slide 20 for Ryan\u2019s summary comments.","Ryan Michael Lance","Thank you, Matt. Well, we\u2019re at the halfway mark for 2013, but more importantly we are in [the home stretch] of a multi-year effort to transform ConocoPhillips into a unique compelling independent E&P company.","So let me also summarize the key takeaways from this call. Operationally, we are approaching a very significant inflection point for the company. We have several important milestones to achieve in the next two quarters and we should see good momentum coming out of 2013. We are building our inventory and delivering visible results from our conventional and unconventional exploration programs that will sustain our growth well into the future.","Importantly, we expect to deliver our operational performance safely and efficiently. Financially, we\u2019re committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and that can provide our financial flexibility. We\u2019re seeing the early stages of cash margin improvement, which should continue as our volumes grow and as always, we\u2019ll maintain our focus on improving returns.","Strategically we are delivering on our value proposition. We expect to complete our announced asset divestitures in 2013 and this will provide the financial flexibility to fund our investment programs, which we are on track to deliver volume and margin growth and our dividend remains a top priority.","The bottom line, we\u2019re committed to creating long-term value by delivering 3% to 5% growth in both production and margins with a compelling dividend. So I hope Jeff, Matt and myself have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones in 2013 and they will certainly position the company for very strong finish to the year and an exciting 2014.","So now with that, let\u2019s turn it back to the moderator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question is from Faisel Khan.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Good afternoon. Faisel with Citi.","Ryan Michael Lance","","Hi, Faisel.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","","Hi. Just going to some of your comments on the transactions that you plan to close for the end of the year, can you just give us an update on kind of when you expect, precisely when those transactions will close in Nigeria and Algeria and Kashagan versus kind of what guys had expected when you announced those transactions earlier on.","Ryan Michael Lance","Yeah, thanks, Faisel. So when we set up our plants last year we were thinking towards the latter half of the year, mid year for some of the transactions may be a little bit later. It looks now to us that we will probably; we will complete all those transactions by the end of the year.","There are complex full country exits with respect to Algeria, Nigeria, and Kashagan, so you can probably appreciate the complexity that's their. But we are on track to finish those by the end of the year, which is what we have said all along. In terms of planning, we were thinking maybe a few of them would be done by mid-year, but they will stretch into, a little bit into the third and fourth quarters.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","","Okay, is that influencing at all the guidance, the change in guidance at all and will continue and discontinue off spaces?","Ryan Michael Lance","","So on the capital that we have talked about, it is impacting the discontinued operations. About half of the capital that we have talked about $600 million, roughly half, $300 million of that is due to those extending the dispositions, and but we\u2019ll get that back through post closing adjustments on each one of the transactions.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","","Okay, understood. Just one last question for me. In the Eagle Ford, lot of sort of industry publications on talking about lower condensate pricing and sort of lower realizations because of kind of the its inability to kind of move all that condensate to market or the consumer to market. Any issues, can you talk, elaborate a little bit more and how you're seeing the pricing of Eagle Ford crude versus some of the industry publications are talking about in terms of discounts and some of those lighter grades.","Ryan Michael Lance","","We don't sell our Eagle Ford crude as condensate type. It is a black oil that we are selling, so we are others maybe giving those sort of discounts we are not.","Matthew J. Fox","","So, just to add on that a little bit. So back when there was more of a spread between WTI, Brent and LLS, our Eagle Ford oil tended to price between WTI and LLS, as that as compressed, it\u2019s trading more towards the WTI type number, but still as Matt saying a full oil price for that product.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","I got it, thanks guys, I appreciate the time.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","Thanks.","Ryan Michael Lance","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin Jr. \u2013 Societe Generale","Yes, hi.","Ryan Michael Lance","Hi, John.","John P. Herrlin Jr. \u2013 Societe Generale","Three quick ones, Ryan you mentioned rebalancing your oil sands exposure, should we expect this to happen over the next few years or are you going to monetize, try to swap or what are you going to do?","Ryan Michael Lance","Yeah, thanks John. Well, we\u2019ve got a very large position. We\u2019ve got 100% acreage, we\u2019ve got joint ventures, it\u2019s Surmont with FCCL. We are looking at a number of different ways to rebalance that portfolio. I wouldn\u2019t get specific on any one way, we are trying to do what\u2019s best for our shareholders, what\u2019s best for our company. We want to maintain some exposure to the oil sands, but rebalance what we do have. I would say over the next this year, you want to see some efforts along those lines, but that will continue probably well into next year as well.","John P. Herrlin Jr. \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay thanks. With respect to the Bakken and Eagle Ford Matt, are you comfortable with the degree of activity or should we expect further acceleration in terms of your exploitation efforts?","Matthew J. Fox","John, we are quite comfortable with the strategy that we have just now, which is a 11 rigs running in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, and we are running that in a pretty efficient way, just now we are well laying out to do that, that we are continuing to learn from pilot tests for example, in the Eagle Ford, and we are at keeping pace with the infrastructure development, so I think we are going to keep on that sort of pace for sometime to come yet.","John P. Herrlin Jr. \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. Last one from me in terms of virgin new players or newer players, Permian and Niobrara, should we expect to see acceleration there in activity.","Matthew J. Fox","Well, we have actually increased our activity this year. We\u2019ll get three rigs running in the Permian just now, testing of that place in the Delaware basin and in the Midland basin, and we\u2019re getting encouraging results there, but one rig running in the Niobrara, just now and we\u2019re continuing to could test that fully across about pretty expensive acreage that we have so, we\u2019re pretty active in both the Niobrara and in the Permian.","John P. Herrlin Jr. \u2013 Societe Generale","Thanks I was just wondering if that could be incremental towards what that\u2019s all. Thanks.","Ryan Michael Lance","","Thanks, John.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold from RBC.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thanks, good afternoon.","Ryan Michael Lance","Good afternoon, Scott.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","In the Eagle Ford it sounds like you said you\u2019d tied-in 65 wells that you\u2019ve drilled in the quarter, and then you had some backlog you put online. How many wells, do you get online during the quarter and you had a pretty nice production bump. Was there any infrastructure that was added, once we began the quarter that also added the increase?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","So, it was 65 in total that we put on in the quarter, but plenty of those were from the backlog and the backlog reduction.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Okay. Where did your backlog right now\u2026","Jeffrey W. Sheets","It\u2019s about 85.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","85, would you, as running 11 rig, what is sort of a normal backlog you\u2019d expect to carry, and is there anymore opportunity to trim off that in the coming quarters?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Yeah, we\u2019re going to adjust that backlog as we work through the year, there is always our backlog almost by definition takes time to come by the end of the year, we\u2019ll probably have 50 or 60 wells, they are drilled but not tied-in.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Okay, got it. And then your 1,900 locations that you have talked about drilling at in the Eagle Ford remind me, what is the space that you assume there, any thoughts on where that can go?","Ryan Michael Lance","That assumes 80 acre spacing and we have pilot test running, testing of (inaudible) business down to 40 acres, but we don\u2019t have a conclusive result yet as to what the optimum spacing might be, so those 1900 continues to be based on 80 acre spacing.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. How long will it, when should we hear about the more conclusive result that day and do you think is that more 2014?","Ryan Michael Lance","That\u2019s more a 2014 really before we, I mean the information continues to come in, before we would draw any definitive conclusions is probably something next year.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Any early thoughts that it is pretty encouraging so far?","Ryan Michael Lance","It really is too early to see. I don\u2019t see it is increasing the spacing permit, but we continue to look to see if there is value optimization and reducing that space.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then one of the things on the oil sand plays, you talked about rebalancing that, can you remind me so, within your guidance for 2013, is there any effective just sort of rebalancing effort for the oil sands yet?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","No, there is not Scott.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Ryan Michael Lance","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. I guess continuing on the same just around the shale portfolio, I mean it feels like obviously the Eagle Ford has been great for some of the companies who have been now including yourselves, do you sort of feel that your sort of shale production and particularly in the liquids all sort of slowed a little bit in 2014, and then reaccelerate as you add activity to these other plays, I mean maybe give us some color about how you see the evolution of that?","Matthew J. Fox","","We expect to see production to continue to grow in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Permian over the next few years. The Permian from an unconventional perspective, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of potential there. We are seeing probably at least two producing wells in the Avalon, two or three in the Wolfcamp. So we continue to be encouraged by the unconventionals in the Permian. And so time will tell how much that contributes to growth in the long-term, but we do expect to see growth in the Eagle Ford, the Permian and the Bakken for several years to come frankly.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","And then a question for Jeff, diving into the weeds on the cash flow statement, two line items. This will be fun. Two line items that are difficult for us to forecast, one is deferred taxes and then there is the catch you have, which is other. Obviously as we focus on cash margins at the E&P level, obviously it has to translate into cash flow for the group. So on deferred taxes, is that predominantly U.S. or is there some international component in the 2013 numbers so far?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","Yes, there is. A big part of it\u2019s U.S., but also Norway and the UK are pretty substantial contributors to this as well. If you think about the tax, what deferred tax is, it\u2019s just where you\u2019re able to take more rapid tax depreciation and financial depreciation and UK and Norway, both have fairly accelerated tax depreciation. Of course the U.S. has some IDC benefit as well.","","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","And then on the other line, which is sort of a $500 million swing first quarter to second quarter, can you just talk what is in the other line [next]?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","That is a difficult one because there are a lot of things that go into the other line. Maybe just a little bit of, kind of if you think about how to think about all the things that go into the cash flow statement for us overall. When we talk about cash margins we took a very simplified approach and just have net income plus DD&A and talk about that as our cash margin. But for us going forward deferred tax is probably a pretty substantial positive for us this year and probably us this year and probably on into next year. A lot of the other items on the cash flow statement are going to generally offset each other. You will see that cash flow from operations other line, it\u2019s going to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, probably for the year, that\u2019s probably couple of hundred million dollar negative typically.","In particular though, if you looked at the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, those are unusually negative numbers and those were both results of some special items, which had positive effects to income, but with non-cash impacts, where the offset to that is in the cash flow from other lines.","So I would say the fourth quarter and first quarter were pretty [unanimous] numbers for that line item and you should think about line items being more of a kind of few hundred million dollar negative for most years.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks very helpful. Thanks Jeff.","Janet Langford Kelly ","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys.","Ryan Michael Lance","Hi, Paul.","Matthew J. Fox","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, Matt, in Eagle Ford you are saying that you are going to move into the pad drilling. How many rig is actually ready in the pad tubing at this point?","Matthew J. Fox","We have got four or five there are currently pad drilling in the Eagle Ford.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And so as we move, I presume that by mid of next year that second quarter or so you are going to be 100% in pad tubing and at that point, what is your best guess in terms of your unit cost will change 10% to 15% of the improvement or do you think that you may be able to drive better than that?","Matthew J. Fox","Well, time will tell. We know that we are seeing improved efficiencies in the pad drilling with a fewer rig moves and all the other benefits that come from pad drilling, but I think it\u2019s too early Paul to put a number out there, just probably \u2013 we know we will see efficiencies, I wouldn\u2019t put a number on it just now.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I am not sure that, maybe I missed it, I have to apologize if that\u2019s the case, that you guys have to like coming now with maybe of the longer term production or we saw target for Eagle Ford and Bakken, let\u2019s say by 2017, how much do you think that those two area will be able to produce that?","Matthew J. Fox","We haven\u2019t come out with any updated view of that yet.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","But we have got it in the Analyst Meeting material, both for Bakken and actually for all the Lower 48 plays in the Analyst Meeting material.","Matthew J. Fox","That we put out last year, so Paul\u2026","Ellen R. DeSanctis","February.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So any kind of update?","Matthew J. Fox","No, we are really kind of working through that process now. The great part of that getting to the position now where we got the Eagle Ford acreage primarily held by production is, we got a lot of flexibility to step back and ask ourselves, what is the optimal rate to develop that field and wet got a lot of work going on to do that right now.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Right. And Jeff, along that line, I mean that paying up very lousy picture in terms of all the opportunity. So some of the Cap expense on, are you guys still looking at around in the $16 billion year over the next several year or that is also start to material see some adjustment?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","No, Paul, we\u2019re targeting that $16 billion annual number. So, we see some changes in the mix as we go forward over the next five years. We\u2019ve got some major projects that start ramping down and we see some opportunities in our base plans as Alan described, to ramp up some of the unconventional North American stuff. But, no, we still think $16 billion is the right number to use.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ryan, since that you guys are sort of up this year for reduction target a bit, how about next year? Is there any change?","Ryan Michael Lance","No. Not at this point.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Not at this point. And then finally, Matt, in Eagle Ford I\u2019m wondering you\u2019re not going to rig in Bakken, you\u2019re also wondering \u2013 you\u2019re not going to rig \u2013 but it does look like that you have a stronger position in the Eagle Ford. Is there any reason that why we\u2019re running that similar amount of rig, I presume that the CapEx, I\u2019m not sure that if you (inaudible) 11 rig, that the CapEx program under two base and at this point are dramatically different for this year. Is there any particular reason why you haven\u2019t shift more of your effort into the Eagle Ford?","Matthew J. Fox","We\u2019re managing the pace of activity to make sure that we don\u2019t go ahead of infrastructure, to make sure that we\u2019re able to run safely and efficiently and the reason you don\u2019t see so much production appearing in the Bakken from the 11 rigs outrun we don\u2019t look probably as we\u2019re talking interest in the book and there is 50% or less and if it was in Eagle Ford this in high 80% to 90%. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing the same in the bottom line and then the underlying rates from the Eagle Ford and Bakken as well, but it\u2019s really try and make sure that we are managing and running an efficient, safe program with these rates.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So we should assume that the 11 rig for each base, this year to stay for the next one or two years?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","Yeah, certainly their intention is to stay around that level for the next year or so. Yeah, and we\u2019ll learn as we go. We\u2019ll learn from our pilot tests and we may adjust that, but right now yes it\u2019s for modeling purposes, that\u2019s what I would assume.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Hi, guys, I got a couple of quick ones please. So you have mentioned that you might consider having move to Alaska in terms of perhaps incremental investment. You both have got interest in what is a growing suite of exploration success, and in terms of long-term capital planning. How should we think about balancing those two items. Does the CapEx go up to accommodate these incremental projects or does it get reallocated away from different areas. If could you kind help us with that and I\u2019ve got a follow-up please?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","The $16 billion number includes assumptions of both major capital programs that will come for example from an exploration program, and any increase that we see in Alaska is also included in opportunities that we are modeling within the $16 billion overall program. And so you shouldn\u2019t see an increase from the $16 billion to accommodate those?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay now those major capital projects have they also included in your production outlook?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","Yes, they are, yeah.","Matthew J. Fox","Well, production outlook.","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Yes, they are, yeah.","Matthew J. Fox","","Well, just to be clear, that\u2019s not in \u2013 when we talked about our production outlook for 2016 and 2017 at the Analyst Presentation, we don\u2019t have anything for the Gulf of Mexico discoveries in that production outlook, but we\u2019d have some assumptions that, as we get towards the end of that period we are going to start spending capital there and you will see that production probably show up outside of the time period we talked about where we\u2019ve kind of talked about the production guidance.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So there is no capital guidance?","Matthew J. Fox","So the capital going into those projects in the Gulf of Mexico for example with no production, in Alaska, we were not assuming in our plans last year that we will see incremental production in Alaska; that incremental production will be tied to activity associated with SB-21, but we do have the capital flexibility to accommodate.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow up Matt is maybe just on some of the well results you have recently on both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. We are monitoring this doc and that looks like just in the last couple of months you have some pretty stellar well results. I am just wondering if you can confirm you\u2019re seeing that in your production trends and if you can maybe help us understand if something is changed, are you drilling that particular area, are you changing well design, what\u2019s going on in there now? Thank you.","Matthew J. Fox","Yeah, we\u2019re continuing to vote for example a fact design in places like Eagle Ford, the number of stages that we pump, the volume of [propane] that we pump and we are doing that as learn from our pilot pits and what we are learning is that the more stages and more profit makes a difference. So going forward we\u2019re going to be continuing to optimize that.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you\u2019re seeing your 2013 vintage wells delivering better than let\u2019s say 2012 Panyu growth wells?","Matthew J. Fox","Yeah, on an average that was going on here.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Matthew J. Fox","","Thanks, Doug","Ellen R. DeSanctis","","Thanks, Doug","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Hi, good afternoon guys. Just clarify on the disposal program. I think you said you expected this to complete by 2013. I think you\u2019re referring Nigeria and Algeria. Could you just repeat? Excuse me if I missed it what you said about Canada as well. I know that things changed there a bit versus your expectations. I wanted to just understand how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward. Thanks.","Ryan Michael Lance","","Yeah, thank you, Paul. In terms of Canada, we\u2019re continuing to look at the opportunities we may see a little bit before the end of the year, but most of what we\u2019re trying to do in Canada will stretch well into 2014. I\u2019ll be referring to cash again. You\u2019ve probably seen the news. We were notified in early July by the Kazakhstan Government that they\u2019ve elected to preempt on the arrangement that we had with OVM and we\u2019re in conversations and discussions right now with the amount of Purchase\/Sale Agreement and those are going quite well. So that\u2019s progressing along.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I guess my understanding was that kind of in the likely order of events that would be first Algeria, then Kazakhstan and Nigeria was difficult to that I can guess. In terms of, it sounds like great \u2013 seem that\u2019s fairly straightforward now they pay the same price that was [of the ONGC].","Ryan Michael Lance","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. So that should go pretty quickly. And then, obviously the other two, I guess that you\u2019re finding that these [devils] are highly accretive to you, right?","Ryan Michael Lance","Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, would be logical to consider further disposals for next year to continue the accretion?","Ryan Michael Lance","","Well, I think as I try to explain, I think when we get down with the three that we have described here today, we have got some rebalancing we want to do in the old sense that we talked about and then I think it\u2019s healthy and prudent to continue to improving the portfolio on the low end. So there is some modest level of divestitures that we see out overtime in the portfolio in $1 billion to $2 billion range or something like that, but we don\u2019t have any large ones that we have talked about other than, looking at trying to rebalance in our oilsands position.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I understand. And then obviously with 3% to 5% double target that you have got, I think Paul Cheng highlighted, it\u2019s basically unchanged by today\u2019s better outlook for this year\u2019s volumes?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Yeah, no, we are sticking to the 3% to 5%. Again we pin that back when we came out year and a half ago. So you do the math and do different numbers depending on when you pick your starting point and ending point, but I am anchored back to when we came out as an independent company in May of last year and that\u2019s our commitment over the next four to five years as you will see that kind of growth in both volume and margins for the company.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","And just as completely reiterate, what speaks up before, you\u2019re basically saying that at that point, you would be covering the dividend and the CapEx annually based on I think of $110 right by 2017?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Well, it\u2019s prior little bit lower, oil price we don\u2019t assume $110 or we\u2019re buying more or like $90 to $100 kinds of prices in the middle of $3 Henry Hub prices. And yeah, we start fully covering our CapEx and dividend in the next couple of years, but that deficit start shrinking pretty quickly over the next couple of years, so it\u2019s very manageable with the proceeds that we estimate will have by the end of this year, the cash will have on the balance sheet, that\u2019s the plan and we can cover it very easily at that point.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. I understand that. Sorry again I apologize if I missed this. Was there a specific update on the progress in Australia and where your projects down relative to the other two major projects going on down there?","Ryan Michael Lance","The APLNG is in good shape. The project just now is about 45% complete and we are making good progress. We are still on track for starting up in 2015.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And there was a cost review I believe which came through with Needham.","Ryan Michael Lance","And we reviewed that to the analysts the results of that to the analyst earlier in the year, and there is no change from what we described then.","Matthew J. Fox","Other than seeing some fairly significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Australian Dollar which is probably mitigated some of the cost increases we thought we were seeing on in U.S. dollar terms.","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Yeah, I think what we had said is like 7% increase in the underlying cost and the spent currency and that was looking like a 20% increase in U.S. dollars depending on how the FX goes and may not the 20% increase in the U.S. dollar basis?","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks guys. That\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Ryan Michael Lance","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And the final question we have time for is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon thanks for taking my questions.","Ryan Michael Lance","Hi, Kate.","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Hi, Kate.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, just a quick question for Jeff, thanks for providing the color on slide 7 and 8, can you talk about the cash margin improvement that might be stemming from a difference in cash taxes between 2012 and 2013, just as you\u2019ve changed some of the geographic distribution of production. Is there any impact there that you can help us extract?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","In kind of the question was the deferred taxes a part of that, is that?","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Why it is different? Why just different cash tax rates between the regimes exactly?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Yeah, so really the benefit comes from just pretty much the cash margin benefit comes from where we\u2019ve added production. And we\u2019ve added production primarily in Canada, in the Lower 48 and in Asia, and those are all tax rates, which are less than our current average tax rate.","When we do this cash margin calculation, we do a simple calculation, so we can have some comparability to other companies. So we just take net income plus DD&A, and call that our cash margin, so deferred taxes don\u2019t come into, but we talked about, when we talk about cash margins.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay.","Ryan Michael Lance","And as I mentioned, as you\u2019re thinking about cash flow model and things like that, you should think of deferred tax as being like you\u2019ve seen in the first couple of quarters of this year, that kind of it\u2019s going to continue on because of it, where we are spending our capital dollars.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. All right, thanks. And then maybe just another question on Alaska, as you guys look at evaluating additional investment opportunity, you specifically talk about the evaluation in light of SB21. How are you taking into account potential marketability of the crudes as well and what specific type of crude are you with your investments be targeting? Is it light or is it heavy and how does marketability play a factor?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","I mean the opportunities that we are looking at predominantly light oil opportunities with production similar to EPI to what we have just now. We also see opportunities in the heavy oil in Alaska, but that would be a bit further out and before we would see a significant increase in that.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And no long-term concerns around marketability?","Jeffrey W. Sheets","","No, no.","Katherine L. Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. All right, great. Thanks very much.","","Jeffrey W. Sheets","Thanks Kate.","Ryan Michael Lance","","Thanks Kate.","","Ellen R.

We also advanced five major projects toward startup by the end of the year. And that includes our two major projects with Surmont II and APLNG. ","Financially our earnings were materially impacted by low prices. We had a $222 million loss or $0.18 per share after adjusting out special items. We generated 2.1 billion in cash from operation excluding impacts from working capital and ended the quarter with 2.7 billion in cash.","Costs are our big focus this year. At our analyst and investor meeting we announced the goal to reduce operating cost by $1 billion in 2016 versus 2014 and we are already moving to needle. We\u2019ve made significant progress on capturing deflation capital benefits on our capital program which we also outlined at our analyst meeting. Strategically announced our new three year operating plan that provides predictable growth for about 11.5 billion of capital per year. We\u2019re making good progress on implementing that plan this year, as we ramp down activity across the portfolio. We still grow high margin volumes in this CapEx level and in 2015 we plan to deliver production growth from continuing operations without Libya of 2% to 3% compared to 2014.","Now I'll turn the Slide 5 for our more of discussion on earnings. Production came in the high end of guidance we also saw improvement in our cost which as we discussed in the analyst meeting includes production and operating cost, SG&A and exploration expenses, but excluding dry holes and leasehold impairment. Those costs improved 7% compared to the first quarter of last year. When you adjust out the restructuring charges which were a special item for the quarter, you see a 12% improvement in our cost. ","However sharply lower prices overwhelmed that performance. We realized prices were down 30% compared to last quarter and down 48% compared to the first quarter of 2014. That contributed to the first quarter adjusted loss of $222 million or the $0.18 per share. First quarter segment adjusted earnings were showing a lower right part of this chart. The financial details for each segment can be found on the supplemental date on our website and segment earnings are roughly in line with our sensitivities, except for the lower 48 where adjusted earnings were differentially impacted by lower realizations, both in absolute terms and relative to markers. This impact wasn\u2019t just from crude but also from NGLs and natural gas. Lower 48 earnings also reflected the previously announced dry hole expense from Harrier. And the other international segment adjusted earnings were driven by the MOC 1 dry hole in Angola.","If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll summarize our production results for the quarter. Our projections slide follows our usual convention and continuing operations excluding Libya. Our first quarter production averaged 1.61 million BOE per day compared to 1.53 million BOE per day in the first quarter of 2014. The waterfall shows downtime and dispositions were essentially flat year-over-year that leaves net growth of 82,000 BOE per day or 5% growth compared to last year. And of the 82, 61 of the improvements comes from liquids, that\u2019s mostly from oil pants in Canada and conventional in the Lower 48 and Gumusut, Malaysia. Gas was up 21 and some from that\u2019s from domestic gas sales at APLNG that will turn to LNG over time.","Now if you turn to the next Slide, I will review our cash flow waterfall. We started the year with 5.1 billion in cash. During the quarter we generated 2.1 billion from operating activities. And this reflects an environment where Brent was at $54 and WTI was at 48.50 and as you know current prices in the strip are higher than these numbers.","Moving to the chart we saw a negative impact of about $300 million from working capital. For the quarter we spent 3.3 billion in capital expenditures in investments. As you would expect the capital is front end loaded and tapers off through the year as we complete our major projects and ramp down our activity in unconventionals, so that number is not ratable. After paying our dividend we ended the quarter with 2.7 billion of cash from the balance sheet.","Before I leave this slide, let me mention an item that you\u2019ll notice on the cash flow statement in our supplemental information regarding deferred taxes. In the quarter we had -- $555 million benefit to earnings as results of change in tax laws in the UK. This was a special item and not included in our adjusted earnings. This income benefit did not create an immediate cash flow benefit so on the cash flow statement the income benefit is reversed out on the deferred tax line which is why the deferred tax line on cash flow shows a large negative this quarter. Without this tax law change, deferred taxes would have been about an $85 million use of cash in the quarter.","I\u2019ll wrap up my comments on the next slide with some guidance for the rest of the year. We provided guidance at our Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this month. We\u2019re not making any changes to the guidance, but I do want to walk through some of the trends and profiles as we go through the year since most of our first quarter metrics aren\u2019t ratable. We remain on track to achieve our 2% to 3% production growth this year. Our second quarter projection guidance is 1.555 to 1.595 million BOE per day. This reduction from our first quarter mostly reflects the start of our seasonal major turnaround activity.","As I just mentioned we expect capital to decrease throughout the year and we remain on track for 11.5 billion of capital this year. Our operating cost guidance of 9.2 billion remains unchanged we did better on a run rate basis in the first quarter and as we continue to work on lowering cost. We could see further improvement in our cost guidance for the year especially if the U.S. dollar stays strong but we\u2019re holding to the current guideline for now. We expect cost to be higher in the second and third quarters as we go into turnaround season. We\u2019ll also see some higher costs in the fourth quarter associated with our major project start up.","There is no change to our exploration dry hole and impairment guidance of 800 million for the year. We were higher than that rate in this quarter and we\u2019ll keep you updated throughout the year. DD&A look a little low on run rate but we expect to end the year at about 9 billion. This reflects mix shift changes and major projects coming online through the year. Finally, our corporate segment is in line with the guidance.","That concludes the review of our financial performance and guidance. The theme you should be hearing is that we\u2019re focused on executing a prudent plan and we\u2019re delivering on our operational commitments.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning everyone. To begin I\u2019ll quickly go through our segment results for the quarter and then conclude with the preview of some key activities to look out for in 2015. As Jeff mentioned we had a strong operationally, achieving high end of our production guidance and we did that while reducing capital and operating cost and maintaining our relentless focus on safety.","So let\u2019s jump into review of the segment performance starting with the Lower 48 in Canada on Slide 10. In the Lower 48 first quarter production averaged 542,000 BOE per day, that\u2019s a 7% overall increase from the first quarter of last year and represents a 16% increase in crude oil production. Production drill in the conventionals but as we\u2019ve previously announced grew to begin to slow as we see the impact of reducing the number of rigs in operation. Overall in Lower 48 we had 15 operated rigs running at the end of April which is more than a 50% reduction from the end of 2014.","As a result of fewer rigs we expect production growth to slow in the second quarter and begin a slight decline in the same half of year. In our recent Analyst and Investor Meeting we gave you a lot of details on pilot tests and were continuing to run those test across the segment. In addition to our unconventional activities in a Lower 48 exploration and appraisal activity continues in deepwater Gulf for Mexico. We currently have appraisal wells drilling at Gila and Tiber and unfortunately Harrier was a dry hole. Next we\u2019ll cover Canada. We saw a strong growth from our Canadian business segment during the quarter. We produce 318,000 BOE per day, a 14% year-over-year increase. This growth came primarily from our oil sands assets with Bitumen productions increasing 26% compared to the first quarter of 2014. In Western Canada we successfully completed our winter drilling program with activity focused primarily in the Clearwater, [Blair] and Montney areas. This activity will reduce as we ramp down our rigs from a high of 10 in the quarter to 2 for the remainder of the year. And the oil sands were seeing strong performance from Christina Lake and Foster Creek, the production continuing to ramp up at Foster Creek Phase F and at Sermont II construction is more than 93% complete and final preparations are underway and anticipation of first theme by the middle of the year.","Next I will cover off our Alaska and Europe segments from Slide 11. Alaska's average production was an 186,000 BOE per day and activity this quarter was focused on several major projects. CD5 and new development on the west side of [Alpine] is more than 75% complete, drilling is already commenced and were moving ahead with pipeline and module instillation. At drill site 2S facility construction is on schedule and driven will commenced in the second quarter. Both CD5 and 2S or on schedule for startup in the fourth quarter of this year. And we sanctioned the first phase of the north east-west act development, the 1H NEWS project in March and we expect to see first production in 2017. In addition to progress on these projects we resumed operations of the Kenai LNG plan with exports expected to recommence in May.","Moving on to Europe first quarter production averaged 209,000 BOE per day. We saw two startups this quarter at the Eldfisk II and Brodgar. Eldfisk II production will continue to ramp through the year as we bring additional wells online and the Brodgar H3 subsea tie-back well achieved first gas in March. Enochdhu is also progressing on schedule and should start in the third quarter. ","Now let's review Asia specific and Middle East segments and other international segments on Slide 12. In APME we produced 351,000 BOE per day in the first quarter, this is 10% increase compared to the first quarter of last year. Primarily as a result of new production from major projects starts up at Gumusut and S&P in Malaysia. The Gumusut 2014 production system in continuing to ramp up, with full fuel production currently exceeding a 150,000 BOE per day on a gross basis. At KBB production remains constrained awaiting third party pipeline repairs. We achieve first gas from Bayu Undan Phase III program in March and production is continuing to ramp up.","The APLNG project was more than 90% complete at the end of March, we achieve first fire from one of our gas turbine generate as in April and we\u2019re progressing towards startup in the third quarter. In our other international segment we\u2019re continuing to focus on our exploration and the appraisal programs, in Angola we spotted the Vali well this month and we\u2019ll update you on a progress there next quarter. We announced the dry hole at Omosi where we encountered the gas column and subsequently plugged the well. In Senegal planning continues for an appraisal program in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Libya our production remains shut in due to ongoing unrest and it remains out of our production guidance for the year.","I'll wrap up my prepared remarks on Slide 13 with some key activities to watch in 2015. As Jeff mentioned we\u2019re on track to deliver 2% to 3% production growth this year. For the second quarter we expect to produce 1.555 to 1.595 million BOE per day. The key driver is a typical turn around activity which you see in the upper right chat. Our major turnaround activity for the year is schedule in Alaska, Europe and APNE, in the second quarter and third quarter. These large turnarounds staring June, so we\u2019ll see an impact on production in the second quarter with a more significant impact in the third quarter. In the Lower 48 we expect production to begin to decline in the second half of the year reflecting our reduce rate count. As I just mentioned we ended April with 15 rigs and we expect to run 12 rigs through the second half of the year.","Moving to major projects, there are 5 startups expected before the end of the year Surmont 2, APLNG, Enochdhu, CD5 and Drill Site 2S. Production from these five projects were minimal in 2015 but will provide momentum going into 2016. We also have exploration and appraisal activity underway, as I said earlier we spotted the Vali well in Angola this month. We plan to start drilling the Vernaccia and Melmar wells in the Gulf of Mexico and the second and fourth quarters respectively. And we expect to spud the Cheshire well and Nova Scotia in the fourth quarter. In Senegal we plan to start appraisal work before the end of the year and we\u2019ll continue to appraise our existing discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico.","So that\u2019s a quick review of the segments. We gave you a lot of information at the recent Analyst and Investor Meeting, so there is not a lot and new to add. We are playing close attention to the things we can control by safely executing our operating plan, capturing capital and operating cost improvements and creating value for shareholders. So this ends our prepared remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And we have Douglas Terreson from Evercore ISI on line with the question. Please go ahead.","Douglas Terreson","A key element of the path to cash flow neutrality that you guys talked about at the Analyst Meeting for the next few years is the shift in spending away from the capital intensive projects in the oil sands and also in LNG and towards unconventionals. And on this point, I wanted to see if we could get an update on when you expect Surmont and APLNG to commence operations and therefore for spending to be significantly curtailed? And second is a $2 billion reduction in spending which is about 20% of the budget kind of a reasonable order of magnitude type reduction for these two projects or is that too high? So if we just get the color on what to expect on capital spending declines.","Matt Fox","So Doug, on Surmont II we expect to have first steam sometimes relatively soon certainly by the middle of the year. APLNG we expect to start up there in the third quarter. So it\u2019s pretty much in line with still with what we discussed at Analyst Day and what we\u2019ve been expecting for some time. And as we move from 2015 into 2016 we\u2019ll see a about $2 billion reduction in capital associated with those projects but that won\u2019t be seen from stack up immediately because we still got capital being spent in both of those projects and through the end of the year. Between \u201915 and \u201916 it\u2019s about $2 billion reduction.","Operator","And the next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Matt one of the things that has changed since the Analyst Day is unfortunately you had a couple of dry holes from a sizeable write-off and I guess I\u2019m mindful that you had a lot of obligations on drilling this year in exploration. When you consider a 1.5 billion in exploration relative to let\u2019s say M&A and opportunity so there\u2019d be both from working interest on their onshore or something like that. How does your exploration appetite look post 2015 once those obligations are rolled off? And I\u2019ve got a follow up.","Matt Fox","Clearly we\u2019re disappointed in the results we\u2019ve had from Angola so far we and the whole industry in fact expected that that pre-salt clay in the Kwanza Basin showed a similar characteristic as the pre-salt clay in Brazil, but it\u2019s not planning out that way so far. On the other hand we\u2019re really pleased with the results that we had in Senegal which on the face of it was a more risky play and there as we saved prudent 2 different clay types in the basin, we\u2019re looking forward to getting back there. Of course as you know that\u2019s the nature of exploration.","In terms of sort of long term role for exploration, I mean we see explorations role to supplement the resource portfolio with additional opportunities to sustain long term growth and with exploring in plays where we think we can do that at a competitive cost of supply. And over the last five years or so exploration has delivered a lot of success remember the Eagle Ford was an exploration success for us. And during that time we\u2019ve been building the deep-water portfolio and focused initially in the Gulf of Mexico and we already have significant discoveries there too, 3 discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, additional to Senegal.","So we\u2019re continuing to test the portfolio, but clearly exploration has to compete for capital in what is a very competitive investment portfolio. And as we outlined when we describe the resource base and the cost of supply of our resource base a few weeks ago, but we see that as good discipline there, to make sure that we\u2019re only committing to exploration opportunities that we think we can compete against our resource base.","Doug Leggate","I guess like kind of a related question, I was going to have another follow up but I don\u2019t want to take up too much time so maybe I\u2019ll stick with this one. But I\u2019m thinking really more about the scale of the discretionary capital because 1.5 billion is still a descent chunk of your spending this year, so where would you expect that to move towards let\u2019s say in a lowered oil price environment should this continue? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Matt Fox","Thanks Doug. Well in the operating plan that we laid out a few weeks ago, we\u2019re anticipating a level of about 1.5 billion this year, next year and in 2017. We can revisit that to some extent, but that sort of expectation as of sort of planned average over the next few years.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good afternoon everybody. A couple of quickies. You mentioned on Libya that you are shut in, is that full-shore shut in or can someone else be producing those volumes and the follow up which is also a fairly quick and clean, could you talk a little bit more about the Kenia sales, I'm not sure who is buying that, Ohio is selling it and then I have a longer term follow up.","Matt Fox","So Libya yes that productions shut in and we are confident of that shut in in the Waha concession, so nobody else is producing it. The Kenia and we started operations up this month, will sell their cargos starting next month, we have growing our sales five or six cargos and they are going to Japan.","Paul Sankey","Is that kind of spot sales. Matt?","Matt Fox","Yes.","Paul Sankey","Got it. Matt, one of the things that people have been talking about since your analyst meeting is your comments on the pilot that you ran and pilots that you're continuing to run in the Eagle Ford. Could you just expand and talk about what could be the next catalyst in terms of news flow on those pilots? Thanks.","Matt Fox","Yes, thanks Paul. So, we are running several different pilots in the Eagle Ford in particular, in the upper Eagle Ford we are running I think 7 different pilots and across the over -- across different parts of Eagle Ford to test the triple stack concept that we talked about and just to understand, what parts of our geographic extent of the Eagle Ford is going to be meaningful to the triple stock development. ","So, those pilots are going to be drilled, as we go through this year and we\u2019ll start to see results, as we head into next year, so they I don't expected it to drill any definitive conclusions on just how much of the aerial extend will be developed that way until maybe the later part or next year frankly because a lot this is understanding till the wells began to interfere with each other and you don't see that early in the wells life. ","And off course we're still running this stimulated growth volume pilot that we talked about and we're going to get lot of new information from this year that from a longer term basis in terms of optimizing the Eagle Ford as a whole and other unconventional plays that we have in the portfolio.","Paul Sankey","Yes, Matt, just remind us what the uplift is in terms of performance that you I think we're anticipating, if I'm not wrong. I can't remember if you've seen initial results or whether you anticipate. ","Matt Fox","Yes. The initial results from single well pilots in the upper Eagle Ford basically showed the production was the same as to Lower Eagle Ford and of what we haven\u2019t test yet is windows are drilled in the context of a pattern of wells, do we see interference. And that's what we\u2019re testing with these days seven pilots that were running now.","Paul Sankey","So, there was actually a number I think associated with what you might get in terms of improved performance?","Matt Fox","No, I don\u2019t think we went into that yet Paul, because we really need to understand the nature of this pilots, how they perform when they\u2019re confined with other wells, we didn\u2019t actually make any view prediction about what we expect to find. We\u2019d rather do that after we're seen the pilot test results.","Paul Sankey","Okay and as you said this something that's going to take a bit of time to really -- maybe by next analyst meeting I guess?","Matt Fox","Yes it's possible but then it may take you to longer than that, we don't want jump the gun and I wouldn\u2019t, we\u2019re definitely encouraged as we said a few weeks ago, but we want to make sure that we\u2019re calibrating properly before we make any claims with that what there incremental reserves will be for example.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hi, Guys. Two quick question. Matt can you share what EPLNG the cash operating cost and the tax regime?","Matt Fox","We\u2019re not in the operating phase yet for EPLNG, so the -- I don\u2019t have the operating cost number of the top of my head. The tax regime is a tax and royalty and regime with royalties at the Queensland level and taxes at the federal level.","Paul Cheng","So it\u2019s typical like 10% on the royalty and 30% PPT or TIP?","Matt Fox","Yes. This is actually not fully resolved yet, there is some discussion still under way with the Princeton government on the nature of how their oil could be calculated, so I can\u2019t really give you a definitive answer on that yet. Paul.","Jeff Sheets","I'll add a little bit to what Matt said on the tax side, the taxes are actually paid down at the ATLNT at kind of corporate level and there is going to be as you can imagine with a big capital investment project like that from a cash flow perspective, a fair business tax Shale from depreciation on the investment particularly in the early years of the project.","Paul Cheng","So, Jeff, does that mean that during the first five years that we should assume there's not really had the tax that APLNG need to pay? ","Jeff Sheets","I don\u2019t know but I can give you that precisely in the number that depends on price levels as well. But if we had current kind of prices, that's probably not a bad assumption.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And then, Matt, can you -- maybe I missed it; can you tell me what is the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian production in the first quarter? And if you have any number you can share in terms of the exit rate for this year? ","Jeff Sheets","Yes the Eagle Ford was around the 175,000 about first quarter, and the Bakken was around 55,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. Permian was less than 10, on the unconventional side we also have significant conventional production but in the Shale\u2019s side it was less than 10. So what we expect to happen forward is we the aggregate production from the unconventionals is going to grow a little bit into the second quarter and then it\u2019s going to gradually decline as we exit the year so the fourth quarter exit rate is going to be quite similar to the first quarter rate in aggregate for the Shale plays.","Paul Cheng","And you start increasing the rig count next year again? I think that\u2019s the current trend so we should assume that they will resume the growth or that the increase in rig count for next year will be only sufficient that to hold it flat?","Jeff Sheets","It depends a bit on the pace of the build of the rigs back up you should really assume that it\u2019s going to hold it flat because by the time we get the wells back and running again through the drilling and completion and hook up and bringing them on production. We\u2019re actually going to see the decline in production from those plays continue into the early part of 2016 and then start to increase towards the end of 2016 and based on our current assessment of how we\u2019ll put rigs back to work, they\u2019re probably relatively flat from the average of 15 to the average of 6.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","So a couple of questions on the -- there have been several recent news stories around some of your M&A efforts of potential assets that you might consider selling, any additional commentary that you might have regarding potential M&A programs, are these bringing the people approaching you or are these assets that you are marketing, are we still looking at kind of smaller 500 to $1 billion sized deals. Any thoughts around that?","Jeff Sheets","We\u2019re always in with a portfolio of our size looking at what going to we do in the way of portfolio optimization. As we go forward we\u2019re not going to be pre-announcing that we\u2019re marketing particular assets. You will hear stories probably on the marketplace that we\u2019re testing values on that and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll always be doing as part of a prudent optimization of the portfolio. As we\u2019ve said I think it\u2019s prudent to think in terms of a company our size will do something with its asset portfolio every year and we talked about it, whether that\u2019s a $1 billion so a year there is probably a good go by. It really just depends on whether we\u2019re getting full value for the assets. It\u2019s always about whether we can sell the assets or at least what we think we could receive from in-value if we kept them in our portfolio. And we don\u2019t know what that number is going to be but there will be some level of asset sale.","Ryan Todd","And maybe shifting gears a little bit, in Alaska at the Analyst Meeting you guys had given guidance on Alaska production and you have a couple of projects turning up later this year. I guess can you talk a little about your production expectation in Alaska and maybe that of the industry with these differentials had kind of bounce around quite a bit. Maybe if you look out one or two years, what\u2019s the direction that you would expect in terms of crude realizations and activity levels in general in Alaska?","Matt Fox","We expect with the major projects that we\u2019re doing and the development drilling that we\u2019re doing in Alaska that we\u2019re likely to hold production relatively flat for the next three years and beyond that actually. And we had a reasonably good representation of the overall Alaska production because we get the big production areas we look to drill Kuparuk and Alpine so I think if you at us our macro view of Alaska about wouldn\u2019t be about basis to think about that. In terms of realizations I think currently realizations are -- for the E&S, crude are both $2 or $3 below Brent and we have taken one cargo this year to Asia and one last year and we always have that option if that\u2019s what we chose to do.","Operator","And the next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","I know Conoco remains focused on your yield bridging the cash flow neutrality; how would you respond to the commodity recovery, meaning when you seek to increase cash cushion, balance sheet repair just some level which might dictate or delay any potential reacceleration?","Jeff Sheets","I think our first reaction to an increase in prices is going to be to reduce the amount of cash we use and the amount of debt we might borrow, particularly as we think about the activity levels in 2015 and 2016.","Evan Calio","Any idea in terms of kind of levels or price signal that you need to see to reaccelerate?","Jeff Sheets","I think in the near term I am not sure we see a price level that would cause us to reaccelerate and we are going to want to see what that if there is some acceleration in prices and it's got a more lasting effect as well. I mean we are taking anything about, what's going on with our capital program as Matt mentioned earlier we have a couple of billion dollars rolling off on from certain amount of APLNG and we are -- our plans already accelerating capital spending in places like North American and un-conventional, as we go into 2016.","Evan Calio","Right, right, no, I understood that. Maybe to the other side could you quantify or provide a range of how much more you could borrow and still maintain you\u2019re A rating?","Jeff Sheets","It\u2019s a bit of a -- I don\u2019t think I can actually quantify that because the rating agencies won't tell you exactly what number that is. As I think we would characterize the same way we characterized it on our call last time, we think the amount that we do borrow is going to be -- it could be enough that would cause us to see a one notch downgrade from what's currently A1 at Moody's and A the middle single A with the Standard & Poor\u2019s and with Fitch. And what their have you seen all the agencies do have our credit rating outlook on a negative, so that that's they are going to be anticipating that. ","But once if that were to happen that were moves into a range, what we are comfortable that there is plenty of space there to meet, whatever borrowing needs we might have in 2015 and 2016 as we head towards cash flow neutrality in 2017.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake ","I just wanted to dive a little bit into shale again. I've seen some very strong performance from you guys this year, even stronger in the Bakken. Is there anything you are doing differently this year?","Matt Fox","And we were continuing to work through our optimizations, Ed that we discuss a little bit few weeks ago, optimizing the completion design and the well length and the well placement and so on. I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything fundamentally different going on there, but we are and we are moving towards more pad drilling, 90% of the wells have become pad drilling, but there is not a fundamental change there, the guys are just executing well.","Ed Westlake ","And then on the shale program and obviously a massive cut in rigs, and obviously you do modeling on volumes probably to a far greater degree than we do from the outside. But are there any risk that you undershoot on volumes or you feel pretty comfortable about the trajectory you just outlined?","Matt Fox","I feel pretty comfortable, although for obvious -- the answer I gave earlier on what we expect of our Eagle Ford and Permian and Bakken production to do this year and into next year. Assuming that we do increase our rigs in the way that we intend to next year.","Ed Westlake ","And then coming back to Doug's question on -- you know obviously people are going to focus a lot on cash flow margins and you got these big projects coming up. When do you reckon that APLNG Surmont will sort of hit what you think is sort of a peak operational cash flow? Obviously, whatever the macro gives at that point is a separate discussion.","Matt Fox","Yes. So, peak on both them really for a different reasons, peak operational cash flows in 2017, and for someone to do this because it takes a while as you know to build the steam chambers and ramp up production in the site B project, and in the case of APLNG, we\u2019ll bring the first train on this year, it will be next year before we bring the second train on, so the first year that will have both trains running will be in 2017. So in both cases it will be 2017 before they fully contribute at their plateau rate and off course that rate will continue in both projects for a decades.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin","Two quick ones. You cut your Lower 48 rigs by over half. How many frac spreads are you running, Matt?","Matt Fox","Let\u2019s see, I would say overall we\u2019re probably running three or four, it varies a little bit, but I think three full time and fore if we -- occasionally, so that's our total spread to support to those rigs.","John Herrlin","Okay, great. And at Global you had a passing comment about you being disappointed with the geology. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? That is it for me.","Matt Fox","Okay. So we've had two dry holes there in the campaign, the first at Kamoxi was basically the reservoir wasn't developed, as you know better than most these cabinet reservoirs are quite difficult to predict across the development and in the case of porosity just wasn't developed there. For Omosi porosity was developed, we did see good reservoir faces, but it was gas filled. So the fetch area was feeding into Omosi was overcooked. So two different reasons for the failures on those wells and that basin as a whole is a bit less predictable and then we are talking going in.","There is a valley well that we\u2019re drilling is actually testing a different play than the Omosi and Kamoxi wells were, so will see how that goes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Hi, folks. Good morning. Jeff, back on the balance sheet discussion previously, I am just curious, can you remind me if Libya?","Jeff Sheets","No we've not impaired Libya. For us we would have to see if there is some kind of view that there was a permanent loss of that concession before we really need to do an impairment.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Offhand do you remember what kind of capital employed or anything on that asset?","Jeff Sheets","You know, I don\u2019t know that number off the top of my head it\u2019s on the order of a $0.5 billion, but I wouldn\u2019t -- I am not sure exactly what that number is.","Blake Fernandez","No worries, that's fine. The second question, there has been a lot of discussion with the recent rise in commodity prices here with some of the E&Ps potentially layering in hedges. I know historically that has not been something that Conoco has enacted. But I didn't know if there was any new internal debate as to the potential benefits of doing that specifically for your Lower 48 activity?","Jeff Sheets","No, we take the portfolio approach to thinking about our cash flows. So we wouldn\u2019t really think about doing it for one particular part of our portfolio. Generally our philosophy that we\u2019ve talked about before hasn\u2019t changed, we feel like hedging is by definition kind of zero sum game in terms of value and it\u2019s one of the reasons we keep a strong balance sheet is to be able to handle the fluctuations in commodity price.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","So there has been a lot of talk, sticking with the Lower 48, at what price signal does U.S. shale production start reaccelerating? And as a major U.S. player, not speaking specific to your portfolio, just wanted to get your perspective at what level that might occur, whether it's $60 WTI or $65 WTI or the range of outcomes. And how quickly can the industry bring back that production and what potential bottlenecks to bring that supply back online are?","Jeff Sheets","I can\u2019t speak for the industry as to what price signal they might be looking for, it would certainly be a cash flow of a big impact on that as well. But in our plans we are planning the increases within 2016 modestly, but we\u2019re going to increase as we move into 2016 and that\u2019s in the anticipation of some continued recovery in prices. And in terms of the capacity clearly we\u2019ve laid down quite a bit of rig and the completion and capacity. And that can be brought back relatively quickly. There is a flexible industry that we have in the Lower 48, so exactly how quickly people bring these back on will be a function of the cash that we wanted to back in and the what they see us be an efficient and see if we are could bring the rigs and the completion crews back to work. So I don\u2019t think I answered your question very satisfactorily, but that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got.","Neil Mehta","You got me there philosophically. And then, Matt, I should've asked you this question at the Analyst Day. But the $1 billion of the cost reduction program, that operating cost reduction target, how sensitive is that to the commodity price? Or do you think that is commodity agnostic?","Matt fox","Our intention is to make that commodity agnostic, for the most part we\u2019re looking to get them a sustainable cost reductions through this effort. Now we\u2019re going to get some fluctuations associated with exchange rates and with the changes in the deflationary environment but our focus is on getting structural cost reductions that we can sustain through the cycles.","Operator","And your next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","I guess I would like to ask about the price realization. It seemed a little bit -- well, at least relative to our expectations -- a little weak in the first quarter both on oil and gas. And I was wondering how much of that may just be a function of timing, how much of that is maybe some of the differentials we have seen or a mix of production kind of oil condensate, NGLs, et cetera, working its way through. And the final part of the question, as prices have been recovering does that help on realizations as we think about Q2 and Q3 potentially?","Jeff Sheets","So what we saw in the first quarter was that realizations were probably weaker than what people were expecting primarily in the Lower 48. For example I think our Lower 48 crude oil realization was closer to $40 where WTI was like 48.5 or so for the quarter. What we\u2019re seeing is just a tough quarter for realizations a lost supply in the marketplace. The differentials that we\u2019re seeing are not that different -- that we saw in the first quarter and not that different when we were in a $50 price environment and they were when we were at much higher price environment, but still kind of that same level differentials. I think we would expect to see kind of differentials improve in terms of kind of percent of marker realized and maybe some slight improvement in any kind of absolute levels of differentials as well. The differentials were tough because they were kind of tough across all commodities for us in the Lower 48 as well, just it\u2019s tough on NGLs, oil and natural gas.","Roger Read","Yes, I was just wondering was there any -- I don't remember all the exact moving parts right here, but I am just saying was that a function of any more either a lighter crew that you are selling or a condensate barrel or just it just is what it is? I am just trying to understand.","Jeff Sheets","It's just little bit -- that\u2019s just what the market was in the first quarter, is something really that fundamentally changed in our product mix or the quality of any of the products that were selling that would lead to that kind of differential.","Roger Read","Okay, thanks. And then on related follow-up. The changes in taxes in the UK, give us an idea of maybe how you characterize that. Is it that really helped? It's a nice first step but we need to see more? Does it change anything in terms of how you think about investing over the next say two years, which seems pretty well locked down in terms of expectations on the CapEx side, but it could help on a post 2017 environment?","Matt Fox","Yes. Roger, it helps, the U.K. sector needs as much help as it can get, so the help on the tax rate, it was welcomed. The simplification and broadening of the and uplift on capital is going to help us realize about 12% uplift now in capital when you go through the math and so this -- we\u2019ll build only if we\u2019re thinking as a thinking about overall investment portfolio over the next few years, but it\u2019s certainly was a move in the right direction by the UK government.","Operator","And our next comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Pavel Molchanov","Your guidance for exploration in dry hole $800 million for the year, you said it is unchanged. But it looked like Q1 was well above your annual run rate. So, does that imply that there is going to be a significant reduction in that expense line item as the year progresses?","Jeff Sheets","Yes, it does and by its nature dry hole cost is going to be pretty lumpy and we happen to have both the Harrier well and the Omosi well in Enochdhu hit in the first quarter. You could have quarters where the numbers really low, no well actually gets to TD during that quarter and it could be lumpy again later in the year. But as we look at the overall kind of balance of the year, we think the guidance that we gave at the Analyst Presentation still make sense.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And then you've talked about some of the areas, where you are seeing cost savings that look pretty encouraging. Are there any operating areas where on the other hand costs have been surprisingly sticky, where you are not seeing the savings that perhaps you would have anticipated by this point?","Jeff Sheets","Are you talking about operating cost, Pavel or capital cost?","Pavel Molchanov","I guess more on the CapEx side.","Jeff Sheets","What we're seeing in this in more rapid response in the Lower 48 and other parts of the company and we expect to see some deflation kicking in and we\u2019re already asking some in our international business, but there is a this coming more slowly I mean it's what we've anticipate is coming more slowly from the international business, but it's come very rapidly in the Lower 48 and but we've build in build that sort of the trend, as we anticipated into our expectations of the deflation and we do expect to see those reductions coming in the international over the next several months.","Operator","And we have a question from Asit Sen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Asit Sen","Thanks. Good morning. Matt, just wanted to get your views on the recent industry debate on refracking in the unconventional. And if I could ask two questions on that. First, from Conoco's vantage point what is new in the technology offering that you are seeing? And second, within your portfolio where do you see the most relevance? And if you could frame that on a risk reward context, please?","Matt Fox","Yes. So, we have been running some refracs in our portfolio and some using the diverter sort of technology some just basically straight that pumping the new fracs with existing pairs and somewhat new paths so we\u2019ll be testing a few and the area that we\u2019re seeing the best uplift is as you would expect are our older wells where we pumped smaller jobs with wider spacing so they -- we see some potential there and it\u2019s particularly in wells that were drilled a few years ago and more recently drilled well, so we are continuing to evaluate that, but there is some -- certainly some upside potential.","Operator","I was just turning the call around to managements for final comments.","Ellen DeSanctis","That's terrific. Really we appreciate everybody's questions and comments obviously feel free to come back to us if you didn't get your questions answered. But we're going to give you back a little bit of time here again. Thank you for participating and we look forward to staying in touch with all of you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP \u2013 Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, Christine. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. Our speakers for today will be Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance and Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects.","Our cautionary statement is shown on page two of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements this morning during the call that refer to estimates or plans, and our actual results could differ due to many of the factors described on the slide as well as in our periodic SEC filings. We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today, and that's to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures that most closely correspond to the GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website. And then finally, during this morning's Q&A we will limit questions to one and a follow-up.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, Ellen, and let me also welcome those joining the call today. Since our analyst and investor meeting in November we've received quite a lot of positive feedback on our disciplined returns-based value proposition, but I think we also heard that we needed to show you that we can deliver on this plan; in other words, we said it, but you need to see it. So that's the punchline of today's call.","Since November we've taken several actions that offer a snapshot of our value proposition in action. In addition, our fourth quarter results underscore the inflection point we're at as a company. I'll build on these themes over a couple of slides and then I'll turn the call the call over to Don and to Al.","So we turn to slide four, this is an updated version of our value proposition on a page that we showed you in November. We showed our principles on the left and our cash flow allocation priorities and targets in the middle column. Shown on the right are proof points that these priorities are activated and delivering.","Let me step through them. In the fourth quarter we generated sufficient cash from operations to cover our capital expenditures and pay our dividend for the second quarter in a row, at an average of $45 to $50 Brent prices. As you know, our first call on cash flows is to invest capital to maintain our production and pay our existing dividend, and we're reiterating our 2017 CapEx plan of $5 billion which can achieve this priority.","Our second priority is grow the dividend. Earlier this week we announced a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. The dividend is an important part of our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, and we believe this increase sends a strong signal that we intend to operate dividend that is competitive, sustainable, and affordable through the cycles.","In November we set a debt target of $20 billion by the end of 2019. We're making steady progress towards that goal; we reduced debt by $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet through the cycles, and our plan is to reduce debt as it matures but we're willing to reduce debt more quickly if we find ourselves with additional cash due to higher prices or earlier proceeds from our disposition plans.","We stated a goal to pay 20% to 30% of our cash from operations to shareholders through dividend and share buybacks. In mid-November we began repurchasing shares under the initial $3 billion repurchase authorization. However, like our debt reduction target, we would be willing to put more money to this priority if cash is available and the value is compelling.","Finally, we grew production by 3% on an adjusted basis, 2016 versus 2015, and we did this while spending only $4.9 billion in capital. We're on track to grow up to 2% on that same basis in 2017 when excluding the full year impact of our 2016 disposition plans. We're putting more money to shorter-cycle low-cost of supply investments in the Lower 48. Growth will be balanced against our other priorities, and that's key to our disciplined approach.","Our ongoing commitment to these priorities is that we can enable us to deliver more predictable and sustainable returns to shareholders no matter what the prices do. We believe these priorities are unique and they are working, that's why it's a compelling time to invest in ConocoPhillips. Another reason is we're at a significant inflection point as an E&P company, and I'll describe that in more detail on the next slide.","This slide describes that inflection point in three ways: transformation, acceleration and differentiation. On the left, we've significantly transformed our company. The fourth quarter performance highlights the many changes we made to our business during the past two years which led us to cash flow neutrality in a $45 to $50 Brent environment. As we go forward you'll see sustainable improvements in both our cash flow and income drivers which will also drive improvements in free cash flow generation and in returns.","Our margin should improve as we allocate more CapEx to high cycle, short cycle investments \u2013 high return, short cycle investments. We've guided to lower adjusted operating costs, expiration costs, and DD&A versus 2016, and we think these improvements are sustainable, and we're reducing our share count. These factors should provide strong momentum in 2017 and beyond.","We're also accelerating our value proposition. Investors don't have to wait for a significant price move to the upside for our priorities to start kicking in. As I mentioned, since November we've increased the dividend, reduced our debt, initiated a share repurchase program, and shifted capital within our portfolio to higher marginal Lower 48 activity. We also expect to deliver $5 billion to $8 billion in asset sales that can fund additional debt reduction, buybacks or incremental growth. Our marketing processes are underway, and we'll provide updates throughout the year.","Finally, what differentiates us compared to other E&P companies; we're managing the business for free cash flow, and we laid out clear priorities about how we'll allocate our free cash flow to generate strong returns. Our value proposition balances commitment with flexibility and balances reinvestment in the business with returning cash to owners. Our 20% to 30% payout of CFO is distinctive.","We're focused on returns; not absolute growth. We intend to differentiate ourselves by maintaining discipline through the cycles and across all value drivers; we're not going to chase prices up and down. We believe our diversified low cost of supply portfolio is also an advantage. We have an 18 billion barrel resource base with an average cost of supply of less than $40 Brent that can drive future returns. We believe this inventory of high quality investment opportunity is distinctive amongst our competitors.","So transformation, acceleration and differentiation; these are the themes I hope you take away from today's call. We're on a more disciplined and resilient future path, and that's good for all our stakeholders.","Now let me turn the call over to Don and Al who will describe our 2016 performance and our outlook for 2017 in more detail.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, Ryan. I'll begin on slide seven with adjusted earnings. This quarter Brent averaged about $50 a barrel, and Henry Hub about $3 in MCF, resulting in an average realized price of just under $33 per barrel.","We reported an adjusted loss of $318 million or $0.26 a share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings improved about $800 million. We benefited from a 15% improvement in realized prices and a reduction in exploration expenses.","Sequentially, adjusted earnings improved about $500 million. Approximately $300 million of the benefit came from improved realizations, and $200 million from lower depreciation expenses. Depreciation expense in the fourth quarter was lower, and this was primarily a result of performance-related reserve revisions and the addition of new reserves.","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. Each of our producing segments showed improvement, and three of the five producing segments were profitable in the quarter. The supplemental data on our website provides additional segment financial detail.","2017 guidance is also provided in the appendix of the deck, and I want to comment on two expense items that are significant reductions from prior years: depreciation and exploration expense. We expect lower depreciation to continue in 2017. Our guidance for the year is $8 billion versus $9.1 billion in 2016. This may seem a little counterintuitive given the reserve revisions we announced this morning, however about 90% of the revisions were PUDs, undeveloped reserves, which have minimal impact on our depreciable asset base.","Additionally, 2017 depreciation will benefit from the performance-related reserve increases we saw in the fourth quarter, and finally our consolidated volumes will be a little lower in 2017 but offset by higher equity affiliate volumes.","Exploration expense guidance for 2017 is $200 million versus approximately $700 million in 2016, reflecting the wind down of our deepwater activity.","If you turn to slide eight I'll cover cash flow for the fourth quarter. There's a full year of cash flow waterfall in the appendix but we wanted to highlight the fourth quarter as a better reflection of the current environment, and to demonstrate the inflection point message that Ryan emphasized earlier. As you can, see we continue to make progress on our cash allocation priorities. Again, this quarter we generated sufficient cash from operations to more than cover our capital spending and dividend.","We started the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the fourth quarter we generated $1.75 billion from operating activities excluding operating working capital. Working capital was a $200 million use of cash in the quarter.","Proceeds from asset sales generated $900 million. We retired $1.25 billion debt maturity and accelerated the repayment of our term loan by $150 million for a total debt reduction in the quarter of $1.4 billion. Capital spending was $1 billion.","We initiated our share buybacks mid-quarter and, along with dividends, returns to shareholders totaled a little over $400 million, and we ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. One final comment, as I mentioned last quarter, at Brent prices around $50 a barrel, we would expect to generate about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow on an annual basis. Based on the midpoint of our production guidance, that's still a good marker for 2017. We're going to be keeping a close eye on this just like you.","That concludes my comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Al for his comments on operations.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Don. Well we've had another strong operational quarter. Production came in at the top end of guidance and, again, we again beat guidance for both capital and adjusted operating costs. I'll begin with a review of our preliminary 2016 reserves. Final reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February.","So on slide 10 you'll see that we started the year with 8.2 billion barrels of reserves. We produced 0.6 billion barrels and had additions of 0.5 billion barrels, excluding market factors. So on that basis, our replacement from additions was 81%; that's an 81% replacement of production from additions in a year when we spent less than $5 billion in capital and sanctioned no major projects. Our addition of 482 million barrels results in an adjusted F&D cost of about $10 a barrel.","Market factors reduced our year end reserves by approximately 1.6 billion barrels, and the oil sands represented over 70% of that reduction. About 90% of the reduction was PUDs. Of course, these resources have not gone away. Remember, these reserves were on the books in 2015 when the average Brent price was similar to today's price, so we expect to rebook reserves if current prices hold. The 18 billion barrels of resources with an average cost of supply less than $40 a barrel that we discussed at our recent analyst meeting are also unaffected by these market-driven reserve changes. More details will be available in our 10-K filing.","If you turn to slide 11 I'll cover some highlights from our Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, our production in the fourth quarter was 458,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of about 9% compared to our fourth quarter production last year, primarily driven by our reduced activity levels in the unconventionals.","Production from unconventionals in the fourth quarter was 226,000 barrels per day, a decrease of about 14% compared to our fourth quarter production last year. Underlying declines were in line with expectations, but we also had some impact from winter weather in the Bakken that's behind us now. We began ramping up unconventional rig activity in the fourth quarter and are currently running 10 development rigs.","Moving to Canada, our production in the fourth quarter was 321,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying increase of about 17% compared to our fourth quarter production last year.","The increased production in Canada is coming from our oil sands production ramp-up. For the quarter, we averaged 213,000 barrels per day; this is a new record for us. We've been pleased with the project execution in this segment, and we expect Surmont to continue to ramp-up during the year.","As I had mentioned during our Analyst Meeting, we added another 30,000 net acres to our liquids-rich Montney unconventional play in the fourth quarter, and we also had encouraging results from our Montney appraisal program last quarter.","If you turn to slide 12 I'll cover Alaska, and Europe and North Africa. In Alaska, our production in the fourth quarter was 187,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's essentially flat compared to our fourth quarter production last year. Only a few years ago this segment was in decline, and we've now turned the corner.","Alaska continues to be a very productive area for us with access to medium cycle projects with competitive cost of supply. We concluded Phase 1 of Drill Site 2S in the fourth quarter. Drill Site 2S is another example where our experienced Alaska project team delivered ahead of schedule, and under budget.","In addition, we recently announced an important and exciting discovery in Alaska. In 2016, we successfully drilled and tested two exploration wells on the Willow discovery in the greater Mooses Tooth Unit with encouraging results. Initial technical estimates indicate the discovery could have recoverable resource potential in excess of 300 million barrels of oil. Appraisal of the discovery commenced in January 2017 with the acquisition of 3-D Seismic. As a follow-up to the discovery, we acquired significant new acreage in the December 2016 lease sale to allow us to follow-up on the discovery. In 2017, we will also continue to progress development of the GMT1 and 1H NEWS projects.","In Europe, our production in the fourth quarter was 221,000 barrels per day; that's an underlying increase of 1% compared to our fourth quarter production last year. We've been able to deliver low cost of supply projects that will add production in Europe. We brought Alder on stream in November, and it's continuing to ramp-up. For 2017 we will be continuing to progress Clair Ridge, Aasta Hansteen, and development of the Greater Ekofisk Area.","If you turn to slide 13 I'll cover APME and Other International. In APME our production in the fourth quarter was 400,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying increase of 15% compared to our fourth quarter production last year.","During the year we've achieved key milestones with first production at Malikai, Bohai wellhead platform J, and APLNG train two, which marked the completion of the six-year megaproject. For 2017 the focus is making sure we reap the full year production benefit of APLNG, KBB and Malikai. We will also be progressing Bayu-Undan infill wells and appraising Barossa as a backfill option for Darwin LNG.","Our Other International segment is focused on the exploration and appraisal of unconventional reservoir potential. In 2016 we drilled two exploration wells in Chile. In 2017 we'll continue to focus on exploration and appraisal of both Chile and Colombia.","So let's move to slide 14. Our 2017 operating priorities remain unchanged from what we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November. That's production of flat to 2% growth compared to 2016 production, excluding the full year impact of dispositions in Libya, for $5 billion of capital and $6 billion of adjusted operating costs. We expect first quarter production to be between 1,540 and 1,580 thousand barrels per day, and expect to have our typical profile through the year with second quarter and third quarter turnarounds.","We will also continue to implement our more-focused exploration program. And finally, as Ryan mentioned, we're making progress on our planned $5 billion to $8 billion of asset sales. We have active processes underway, and we'll update you throughout the year.","So operationally, everything is on track for 2017. And now we'll turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning to you guys. The first question I have for you is around the dividend raise. So earlier this week you raised your dividend by 5% to 6%. Is that a good proxy for what we should expect going forward post-2017 as well?","And then, Ryan, can you just talk about the buyback program and how you weigh that versus dividend growth on a go-forward basis?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Thanks, Neil. Yeah, certainly a couple of days ago we announced a 6% increase to the dividend, so what we're doing \u2013 no, it's driven by the fact that we've reached cash flow neutrality in the company; we're generating free cash flow. What we describe to our investors it was important, our second priority to grow the dividend; felt that was important to do, we'd reached that milestone.","As we look at the market, we see some recovery in the market. We continue to, as Al said, operate really well and we'll continue to generate free cash flow as we go forward. So recognizing that priority, we're going to \u2013 we'll be growing our dividend, and that's our intention to do that. We're augmenting that right now with share repurchase as we generate the free cash flow, so I kind of view those together.","We're going to target our 20% to 30% return to shareholders. I think we're at the upper end of that right now with respect to both the dividend and the share repurchase. We'll balance those two as we go forward. We're going to set the fixed dividend, make sure it's affordable and make sure it's sustainable through the cycles. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the fixed portion of our return to the shareholders combined with the flexible part through share repurchases.","By the way, on the share repurchase piece, too, Neil, I'll just remind people we got started in mid-November after the Analyst Meeting, so that represented only kind of a half a quarter in terms of our \u2013 the amount we're trying to buy back over the course of the year.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate that, Ryan. And a follow-up on just the asset sale program, the $5 billion to $8 billion. When do you expect to be able to provide us an update on San Juan which seems to be the one that's most progressed? And can you just comment on early market appetite for North American natural gas assets?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I think we're seeing a lot of interest. These are pretty high-quality assets, so we expect a lot of interest and in fact we're getting that through the data room right now. We expect to get bids in and have some decisions probably over the next couple of months with respect to San Juan.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning or good afternoon I guess at this point.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Hello, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, I think you kind of answered it on the buybacks that you're run rating more like, I guess, $250 million per quarter, and with oil probably averaging closer to $55 at this stage relative to the $50 you talked about at the Analyst Day. Just kind of wondering how you think about that excess cash.","And you had given an example in one of your slides at the Analyst Day that kind of looked like $2 billion, maybe $3 billion of debt paydown per year into the next few years. Is that a reasonable way to think about this year for debt paydown?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Phil, I'll jump in on the debt. I think what we said is that if you look at our maturities I think a $1 billion this year and a little more next year that we pay it down as the bonds matured. If we had excess cash flow then we would look at potentially accelerating some of that, and we certainly have a convenient way and efficient way of doing that with our term loan that's due out in 2019. But beyond that we're not providing guidance on what proportion of excess cash flow would we allocate to debt versus buybacks versus investment in the business.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then a second question would just be we've seen a lot of activity out there from an acquisition standpoint, particularly in the Permian, and given your positioning in US shale and your strategic objectives that you've talked about, obviously M&A really isn't on there. So is it fair to assume you're really not looking at those type of opportunities or if something came up with say contiguous acreage that could enhance your position, would you consider it?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well, I mean, as we've said in the past, Phil, we're in the market. We look at all of these. We watch everything that's going on and we give our teams money to core up their acreage in and around their positions. Al described what we did in the fourth quarter up in the Montney. We had a unique opportunity to core up a fairly significant position that was contiguous to our acreage. We've done \u2013 we've been doing deals like that in all the big areas that we operate in. So that's nothing new to us.","The hurdle rate is quite high in the company; it's got to compete on a cost of supply basis for us. So right now we don't really feel like we have a gap in our portfolio, so we're not out looking to build. We're building some new areas through the exploration channel that we're excited about, but we have a lot of undrilled locations to go drill.","On your previous question, I might just add one thing to Don's response, too: follow the priorities. If we get free cash flow, we've already satisfied and grew our dividend. We're going to look to reduce debt on the balance sheet, and we'll look to increase our share ramp-ups from share repurchases if we think that's the right thing to go do.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Doug.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Doug.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Doug.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Ryan, the company reported positive free cash flow again this quarter and free cash flow should rise further in 2017 it looks like. And on this point, you guys seem pretty confident that you can make your growth and returns profile despite a level of spending that is historically lower than it was in the past.","So my question is what is it in the new reserve and production mix or the spending and financial framework that's so different than what was the case in the past? Because you're spending a fraction of, I mean, what some of your peers are that should support your confidence to deliver in this area?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Thanks, Doug. Yes, it's really the journey that we've bud (27:04) on, getting the major projects up and running and the switch in the portfolio to the shorter cycle, high return, low cost of supply investments that we've got. I remind people that 30% or so of our portfolio doesn't decline for over a decade, and that allows us to reduce the capital burden to maintain and modestly grow the company which is why we feel very confident that we've got that capability to do that at the $5 billion-ish capital level. And then the proof point is exactly as you point out. We grew 3% last year and spent $4.9 billion of capital. So that's why we have confidence.","We've exited the deepwaters, so we're not into that piece of it, and we've seen the technology and the innovation pretty apparent in our portfolio. So all of those things come together and it's buried in that deep 18 billion barrels of resource base that we have, and the journey that we've been on over the last couple of years, and we've gotten now to a place where low capital intensity in the company and it can support a very strong returns-focused value proposition like we laid out to investors last November.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then also strategically, there seems to be a lot more private equity funding in the United States energy sector during this cycle than there has been in past cycles. So my question is how do you view this competitive threat both in terms of competition for resources or oil field services or whatever else you deem meaningful to the topic? And do you think it's significant enough such that it could hold broader implications for your portfolio down the road or is it too early to know?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well I think it's a really good \u2013 a good question. We're spending a lot of time and I'd say probably not a little bit of private equity, I mean, a lot of private equity money chasing, certainly, in the Permian right now. And I think as we look at it, for us I guess where our focus and attention is right now is sort of on the re-inflationary pressures that you might see, and just make sure we've got a myopic focus on holding our margins and making sure that we keep everything.","As I said, we're not going to chase prices up and down as the prices rise if we see a lot of inflationary pressures, which some of this activity and the PE guys are kind of driving right now, we'll spend really \u2013 pay really close attention to that. We don't have to chase it up and chase growth down. We've got a portfolio that we can make sure we do it right and make sure we're focused on margins and returns. But it is \u2013 we've got a close eye on it. We're wondering, we're watching the activity in the rig rates, and it's interesting. We're not sure what they're selling.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thanks very much. Hello, everyone. Can I just ask about the new U.S. administration, how that influences your thinking and particularly maybe your view around the Canadian heavy oil position?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well I think it's a little early to tell. We certainly hope the new administration, at least in terms of what they've talked about, is going to give us a little bit of regulatory relief, which is we think is good. There are some things that the last administration were proclamating that were a bit worrisome on sort of how it might slow the business down, both on the regulatory side and on the infrastructure side.","We've seen President Trump make his decisions on DAPL and on Keystone, so hopefully some of that infrastructure will get moving that's needed to be there. I think a lot of uncertainty on the Border Adjustment Tax and its potential impact on how crude and other products move across the border, whether it's south of Mexico or some of the crude that moves down from Canada into the U.S. I think there's a little bit to be seen yet what that means. Does it get exempted or how are the details of that going to unfold? We're watching it closely, but I think it's a little bit too early to tell on that last piece.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Then my follow-up is just in terms of Doug's question on sort of the capital coming into North America. I mean, given your perspective and looking across the industry, is the pace of the restart in the U.S. surprising you?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I guess it surprised us a bit to the upside. But in the heart of these unconventional plays, the cost of supplies come down. So \u2013 and we're still getting more efficient, and the technology and the innovation is still improving. So, yeah, there's maybe some pace at which people are coming back is a bit surprising, but the idea is not surprising in terms of the overall macro. The growers are protecting their multiple, so they trade on multiples of cash flow. So they've got to get on and run hard.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","That's great perspective. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good morning, and congrats on the cash and discipline, and you've sort of clearly said that your priorities aren't really going to change. But I guess you've got a couple of assets which possibly could benefit from higher activity, particularly thinking the Delaware, the Red Hills and China Draw have seen some very good well results in the industry there. So maybe just talk a little bit about what are the gating factors if you just decide to go a little bit faster in that shale portfolio?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, we just \u2013 Edward, if I just kind of summarize where we are in our Lower 48 activity. Remember on the last call I told you that we were still at three rigs at that point in time, but we were planning a ramp to eight by the end of the year, and be four and four in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And then we would start adding rigs in the Permian in early 2017, and that is what's happened; we did end the year at eight with four and four. And since the beginning of this year we've added an additional rig in the Eagle Ford, so we're up to five there, and we've added one rig in the Delaware at China Draw.","We have a second Permian rig that'll be coming on in the next week or two that'll then take us to 11, and then we'll have additional activity with another rig in the Permian that may also have part of the year in the Niobrara as well. And we also plan to do some drilling in some of our Permian conventional this year. So we'll be in that kind of two to three-rig range in the Permian this year.","As we've been adding these rigs, we've been doing what I talked about on the last call of very carefully checking the costs and going out into the market, seeing what kind of rates we can get, and seeing what kind of \u2013 how long we can lock for, and that's been one of the things that's driving our pace of moving back into these areas.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is it fair to say that one of the surprises that might come over the next few years, I mean, obviously we can't predict oil inflation. But just because of the productivity that you're seeing in the Delaware, is that \u2013 your production growth may even be slightly above the 2% range for the level of sort of CapEx that you're putting in because of the productivity improvements?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, I think that's certainly a possibility, that's one of the things that's driven our outperformance over the last couple of years, is that exact sort of thing. I think you've seen some of that across the industry, so it's a little early to predict that one. But we do \u2013 given the low number of rigs that we're running through most of last year, we do \u2013 we are going to continue to decline in our Lower 48 unconventional out through about the second quarter before we start to turn back up with these rigs that we've added as we get to more of a steady state at higher rigs.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys, you've still got a number of projects that are ramping up and obviously some start-ups next year, the biggest of which has been train two in Australia. Can you give us some idea what the exit rate, the trajectory is going to look like through 2017 for production?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","The exit rate of...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, for the portfolio generally, but I just illustrate there being a APLNG ramp-up. You've also got Gumusut and I guess Kebabangan and a few others. But I'm just trying to get an idea of what the trajectory of production looks like and what the capacity of the portfolio looks like at the end of next year when everything is online.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I think, Doug, you will see our traditional U-shaped production curve where we've got \u2013 it's really driven mainly by turnarounds in the second quarter and third quarter that will cause our second quarter to \u2013 and third quarter to be lower and back up higher in the fourth quarter. But I think that, that U-shape, I expect by the time we get out to the back end, to the fourth quarter, that we'll be at production levels higher than the first quarter. So it's got that kind of shape to it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll...","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","And the major project momentum is a significant part of that. It will add probably 80,000, 90,000 barrels a day next year in 2017 volumes over 2016 from these various major projects.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So going into 2018, the momentum should be north of 1.6 billion barrels kind of is what I'm getting at? That sound about right?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, it should be in that kind of neighborhood. We'll get to those kind of quarterly projections as we move through the year. And of course, all these numbers are ex-asset sales, ex \u2013 don't have the dispositions in there, whatever those may turn out to be. So you got to be careful there with these numbers, but yeah, that's...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Go on.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","But \u2013 yeah, so that is the kind of shape that you'd expect in the curve, that we'd be up in that kind of territory by the time you get to exit of 2017.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","And it's those projects combined with the momentum that comes out of the Lower 48 as we come through our profile, and the rigs that Al mentioned are running in the Lower 48 gives us a strong exit coming out of the year into 2018.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Again, our full year guidance, Doug, has been 0% to 2% production growth for $5 billion of capital. So that's kind of \u2013 you can kind of look at that trajectory and figure out where we exit the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. It was kind of a segue I guess into my follow-up, which is on the asset sales. Ryan, I don't know to the extent you will share with us, but $5 billion to $8 billion, what is the, if you could frame for us, the production that goes along with that and more importantly the operating cash flow that goes along with that? And I'll leave that there. Thank you.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. We haven't really talking \u2013 it's really highly dependent on the mix of the assets that we ended up selling, Doug. So we haven't provided any guidance specifically on the cash flow and the production. We'll update that as we go through the quarters and tell you exactly what the cash flow and the production impacts are as we sell the assets. But the timing of that, we're trying to move as quickly as we can, and it's really hard for us to sort of forecast right now what order those things might go out in and what the annual \u2013 quarterly or annual impact might be depending on the assets we're selling.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ryan, just for clarity, would it be reasonable to frame it that the asset sales will be accretive to the remaining portfolio unit margins?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Absolutely.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon, everybody. On the reserves replacement, I was wondering could you outline to the best extent possible how much of the reserves replacement was associated with long-term projects that started up in the course of 2016?","And the reason I'm asking is you're clearly getting to the point through your actual performance where $5 billion a year seems to be easily your stance \u2013 standstill CapEx level sort of maintaining volumes. But I was wondering would that imply also quite rapidly or that you wouldn't replace reserves at that level of spend? Further to that, does it matter? Thanks","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay. There's two or three parts in there. I'll try and take them, Paul. First of all, as I mentioned earlier in terms of our additions, we had no project FIDs in 2016. It's those FIDs that generate those lumpy reserve adds from major projects. And so, really, that wasn't a factor in 2016. That 81% additions was not \u2013 didn't have any drive from major projects. So that's I think the first part of your question.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","It is. Thank you.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. And so it's not that we're not going to have any sort of these medium-sized project FIDs in the future; we will. And I think in years when we have some of those FIDs we'll likely move our way above 100%. If you look at our plan out through the next five years, we average around 100% but it's lumpy as major projects hit FID. But I think you're correct in your thinking that as we move more CapEx to these shorter-cycle unconventionals and you have a year when you don't have FIDs, this is not an unreasonable level to kind of expect to be at.","And the second part of your question about does it matter? I mean, my answer to that is no; I think the important thing to really remember here is what Ryan mentioned earlier, the 18 billion barrels of resource base which doesn't change one iota from the things we're doing here on reserves that's got an average cost of supply below $40; that's really what we're busy processing. And then, of course, there's the other 27 billion barrels in our resource base that's above $50 cost of supply that we're busy using new technology, and driving costs down to try to move it below $50, that those are \u2013 and our exploration program, those are all feeding that feeder pool and that's what we're drawing off of. It tells you that we're not \u2013 despite a number like 81%, we're not getting ready to run out of opportunities to invest in any time many decades out into the future.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thanks very much. The follow-up would be is there a new breakeven price given that you've been cash flow-neutral in the second half of 2016 at a somewhat tiny bit lower price than $50 and performance improvements continue? Could we now think about you guys as a $45 in 2018 or can you set some new parameters for yourself? Thanks.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Well, Paul, I think we'll stay with what we've got there. I think in the high 40s is probably the right way to think about our breakeven price going forward. And acknowledge that the fourth quarter cash flow was very strong, and if you annualize it you may come with a higher result \u2013 you will come with a higher, stronger cash flow result. But you do have to keep in mind the product mix that we anticipate as we go forward with consolidated volumes at least in the \u2013 over the next year declining and being replaced by equity affiliate volumes, and you're kind of in that range at $50 to $55 where distributions are pretty uneven and difficult. So I think we'll stay with where we are on our cash flow breakevens.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a very quick update. The $6.5 billion of cash flow you talked about was at what price for what year for long-term guidance?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","That was, for this year, at $50.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Hi, Paul.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Or good afternoon. Ryan, just curious that it seems like that volume, now everyone want Permian and not too many people want Eagle Ford and Bakkan. And you mentioned that you have some extra cash you're thinking about to accelerate the debt repayment. But at the same time that I think in business that you want to be countercyclical investment.","So on that basis that how internally you contemplate, is it better off to see you have extra cash to look at opportunity to be a consolidator in the Bakken and Eagle Ford given not too many people are interested at this point then accelerating paying the debt? Can you maybe help us to understand how is the thought process behind when you decide one way or the other?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well we'd look at each opportunity individually and then somewhat collectively as well, Paul. So if the guys come up with a good opportunity like we saw the swap that we did up in Canada in the Montney. If we see good opportunities like that in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken we're constantly looking. So the guys are doing 5,000 acres and 10,000 acres or a couple thousand acre trades constantly in our business both in the Permian, in the Bakken and in the Eagle Ford. So if we see an opportunity, absolutely. If it competes on a cost of supply basis and it can mold in and not just be additive to our portfolio but substitutive in our portfolio, we'll absolutely take a look at it.","We're not letting those go, but we judge that against our progress towards making sure our debts are coming down on the balance sheet and make sure that we're giving an appropriate amount back to the shareholders. So we are putting all of those few things into the bucket and trying to make those assessments as we go through the course of the year.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","This may be for Al or maybe for, Ryan, you also. The cost environment that you guys have talked about, can you give us some idea there and update where you see the cost pressures start to picking up or that even some sign that you start to have evidence saying that it may be picking up very soon. Some idea on that.","And also to Al, along the way, since I always ask that question, maybe you can give us the number for the shale oil production by play? Thank you.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay. I'll start with the cost question. I would say so far \u2013 from what we've seen so far this year we would expect our 2017 cost levels to be broadly in line with 2016. On the call last quarter, in response to a similar question, I told everybody that we really hadn't seen any request for cost increase yet and I can't say that this quarter. I mean, we are starting to see some request for increase, some cost pressure in the Lower 48 in the last month or two as you've kind of seen the whole industry talking about. But in our particular case, there's three offsets to that, that you just think about in terms of how you think about how it's going to impact ConocoPhillips.","One is that our international costs are still coming down. So if you look at our Lower 48 unconventional drilling, it's on the order of $1.5 billion out of the $5 billion that we're spending. So, really, when we talk about some of the pressure we're seeing, it's just against that slice of our $5 billion, that $1.5 billion. That's the first point. And that's being offset by still seeing some things coming down in the other parts to our business internationally. Then \u2013 and so that's the second piece, is that international offset.","And then the third piece is that we have, as you heard me talk about before, done some locking of cost levels, and so we're benefiting from that as we go through 2017. We've got cost locks on various contracts that are on the order of over a year or less that will kind of slow down how we see some of this inflation as we go through 2017. So overall, with what we've seen so far, I think we're kind of broadly in line in 2017 with where we were in 2016.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Al, can you give us which particular portal or service that you are seeing the cost increase request?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","I would say in the Lower 48 unconventional space, so rigs and pressure pump and then cement and all those sorts of things, where as Ryan said earlier there's been a pretty \u2013 I mean, the pace that things are being put back to work is nothing like the pace that they came off in the last few years, but it's been steady. And particularly in the hotter areas, places like the Permian, things where \u2013 places where the excess equipment and crews have been taken up, that's where you obviously start to see some price pressure. So it's been a mix kind of across the board and some of it is geographic depending on how much is available in a given area.","Then let me answer your other part on doing our fourth quarter volumes. So Eagle Ford came in at 143,000 barrels per day, Bakken and at 53,000 barrels per day, and Permian at 18,000 barrels per day. And the total, there's some other smaller pieces so our total L48 unconventional is 226,000 barrels per day for the quarter. I should mention that in those numbers we had a weather impact of about 8,000 barrels that was unusual winter weather impact across the fourth quarter. So when I think about those numbers \u2013 when I look back at what our projections were for the fourth quarter, we're actually spot on what we expected from our Lower 48 unconventional, except that we were down 8,000 barrels from where we would've projected, and that was really weather-driven.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, folks. Good morning. I had two questions for you. One is on deferred tax and one is on Libya. Maybe if I could start on Libya. Can you quantify what the earnings contribution was in the quarter and whether you're actually producing in 1Q? And then if we're kind of at a sustained run rate here when that's back online, does that change your capital outlook whatsoever?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","So on Libya, you would've seen in our numbers that we actually averaged 9,000 barrels a day net in the fourth quarter. If you look at our January numbers, we're producing more like \u2013 it's grown to about 12,000 barrels a day. So that's over 80,000 barrels a day gross now coming from Waha. I also said on the last call that we were having a lot of difficulties with damage at the tank farm and the loading port at Al-Sider. With the kind of production we were having, we might be able to get a first cargo before the end of the year. That that did not happen with the time it took to get everything repaired there.","We have now loaded three cargoes just in January from Al-Sider, so as this production has picked up we've been able to load three cargoes. And that's an advantage for us because during those years when we didn't have any production we did establish a tax loss carryforward. And so now as we're picking these cargoes up, we're getting that cash flow back. So that's a benefit to us here in the quarter","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","I could also add that we don't know what the future of stability of Libya is going to be that's why we always exclude it from our results, and so forth, or segment it. But if Libya were to continue as it is now without interruption, then that could generate between $150 million and $200 million of cash flow that's not included in the cash flow estimates or sensitivities that we have","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","And I forgot, Blake, I forgot to answer your question about CapEx pressure from Libya. If you look at what's going on there now, there's a lot of work just kind of in repair mode. You think about fields like North Gialo that were kind of the next medium cycle project we might do there; it's still way off. Things are not organized in country, and I don't think will be this year, to begin to spend any significant CapEx on things like that. I think it's going to be mainly basic blocking and tackling this year just trying to, in repair mode, trying to keep what we've already got online flowing.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then really the deferred tax. I'll just be brief here. Don, I think you mentioned $50 a barrel should equate to about $6.5 billion of cash flow. I noticed deferred tax is still a negative drain as Lower 48 has negative net income. When that reverses I guess I'm wondering does that cash flow sensitivity that you guys provide, should we be thinking of applying that plus maybe some additional benefit from deferred tax once you hit say $60 a barrel or so?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Blake, you should be \u2013 those sensitivities should be good. I think we qualified them that they were sensitivities for 2017, and they were within a specific range of oil prices of $50 to $60. So once you get above $60 then we'll probably give you some different guidance that's going to be driven by the deferred tax.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Roger.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Roger.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, I guess coming back to kind of the cash flow and the production commentary earlier, the lost 8,000 barrels in the U.S. and the cash flow was good in the fourth quarter. Was there anything in the cash flow or as we think about maybe over the second half of 2016 that you would call out as was either helped or hurt by circumstances? I don't know, I'm just trying to think about it again relative to the guidance given, and whether we should think of it as there really isn't much play or there have been some one-time items both favorable and unfavorable.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Roger, the cash flow in the fourth quarter I consider really clean. We always look at our underlying cash flow that we don't publish, but what's the business \u2013 how's the business really performing, and that CFO ex-working capital, $1.75 billion, almost identically matched our own internal view of what the underlying business was.","I'll mention the only add to that was really the realizations were a little higher than we would've expected driven by tighter basis differentials pretty much across the board. So what that means is that our cash flow sensitivities have embedded our own assumptions about product differentials, and the realizations that we're getting are reflecting improvements over our assumptions. So we're not changing our views of those differentials that are embedded in the cash flows, but as we go forward that provides a bit of upside to the cash flow potentially.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then as we think about what's going on with the reserves, and obviously things could get rebooked, but I don't know this question is for Ryan or for Al, but what's the right way to think about kind of a reserve production ratio that you would either be comfortable with or want to target? Or is that just something that falls out relative to all the other factors that you're managing?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well, I think we've said it repeatedly at our Analyst Meeting stuff. Our R\/P had been running 14 to 15 or so. We've been willing to let that drift down, and that's a consequence, as Al talked about, as we move more investment to the shorter-cycle investments. So I think we'll let that drift down a little bit, but it probably doesn't fall off the cliff or anything because, as Al said, we've got a lot of resources, and as we look forward in our plans over the next five years or so we actually average about 100% reserve replacement. So R\/P will drift down a little bit and then it'll flatten out naturally.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And would we expect much of an impact on reserves with the planned asset sales?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well, yes. I mean, there will be \u2013 commensurate with the \u2013 like San Juan Basin. We've got reserves booked against that asset. So, yeah, as we see the assets and the disposal process work forward, we'll see the rate and reserve impacts from those as well.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And I guess I can't get you to give me a number there? I'm just kidding, of course. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A couple of quick ones. First, Al, you commented obviously there was a pretty good opportunity for you to bolt up in the Montney. Could you just give us a sense of what the plans are up there in 2017 and do you all think that that can compete with some of the other stuff you've got going on in Lower 48?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I mean, I guess, I would characterize the Montney at this point as we're still in appraisal mode. We've been quite impressed by our latest batch of wells and what they've done and the liquids mix that we've gotten from those. And so I would say that we've seen enough up there to see that we've got something that looks like it could compete in our portfolio. And so we're going to continue with that appraisal work, make sure we know what we have.","One thing we haven't mentioned is part of that, some of that work that we did to pick up that acreage, we also did pick up some gas plant capacity, and that's given us a little bit more infrastructure, allowed us to \u2013 some of these wells, frankly, that we brought on have flowed strong enough that we need a little more capacity to be able to just handle the offtake. So we're \u2013 I would say that it's come on better than we might've expected, and now we're continuing to press forward with our appraisal plan, and that will drive us to figuring out what pace we want to put in infrastructure and develop that asset out. But I expect that over time you'll see that it looks like something that could compete in our portfolio along with \u2013 even against the Lower 48.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So certainly it sounds like an 2018 thing if things work out. In Alaska, you talked about the discovery in the Greater Willow area, and obviously bolting on some acreage up there as well. Could you guys give us a sense of how that would play out? Like when could we see the potential impact of some of these obviously high-returning conventional projects like that?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I think, Willow is a very interesting discovery for us in the Greater Mooses Tooth area, out west of Alpine. We not only have that discovery but we were also able in both the state and federal lease sales in December to pick up another 750,000 acres gross; we're 78% across all this acreage in our ownership. And so we, really, we've stood up a team up there in Alaska to really do the work, the development planning work, to figure out what's the most optimum way to develop this new discovery. You could see it being on the order of 100,000 barrel a day kind of production rate that would be supported by just what we've discovered so far. So we need to think hard about how we move forward around infrastructure, et cetera.","It's tough to predict timing because, as you know, the regulatory up there, dealing with the federal government has been pretty uncertain in the past on our other step-out projects. But I would say the earliest you could imagine bringing on a new round of things like Willow that we just discovered to be out in the 2023 kind of timeframe.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thanks a lot.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Christine, this is Ellen. We'll take one more call, just to be respectful of the time here \u2013 or one more question, excuse me.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for squeaking me in here at the end, guys. A couple of quick ones, the first on costs. I mean your CapEx came in quite a bit lower in the quarter, which kind of continued a trend of doing that all throughout 2016. Can you talk a little bit about what drove the beat on CapEx? Was it efficiency gains or deferrals activity? And does it have any implications? I know that you're \u2013 I know that the $5 billion number for 2017 is the base case at this point. I mean, is that \u2013 does it put some downside risk potential on that number or does \u2013 is that offset by the things? And then I have one follow-up.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay. You're right. Every quarter, it seems like our operating groups have been getting more and more efficient and surprising us with lower costs that's happened on both the capital cost side and the operating cost side because you've noticed we've been lowering that number all as we went through the year; now we've projected an even lower number there for 2017. But the \u2013 as you look at what generated this latest beat of $300 million, basically we had said $5.2 billion in our guidance and came in at $4.9 billion. About 80% of that under spend is outside the Lower 48. So it's consistent with some of the comments I was making earlier about where we're starting to see a little inflation and where we're still getting more deflation.","So we had lower costs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, UK, Alaska; and we also had lower cash calls from APLNG which were driven by just the higher price environment that we had in the fourth quarter. So it really was not a slippage or deferral kind of thing but really continuing to drive down costs that drove that. We were able to do that, still grow the 3% production as Ryan talked about earlier, and still leave us very well-positioned on volumes coming into 2017. So I think we're in good shape there; it's not like there's been anything that we \u2013 there was no change in scope that really drove that.","As far as how that goes into 2017, I just rely back on the comments I made earlier about what we're seeing in inflation so far. At this point, I think that we expect the overall cost environment to be similar enough to last year that we should be able to execute the plans we have in mind in these kind of \u2013 this kind of range of prices, in the $5 billion range again next \u2013 this year.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe a quick one. I appreciate the granularity you gave us on maybe some of the near-term trajectory in the U.S. on conventional volumes. But if we think about you ramping the rig program up to that 11 or 12 rigs over the course of this year and if you were to stabilize at that level, I mean, what would that mean for \u2013 what would that type of activity mean for the medium-term trajectory in the U.S. onshore? Is that flattish production? Is that kind on a single-digit growth, low double-digit growth? Anything that kind of...","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So let me kind of paint a picture for you there to give you an idea of how that looks. As I said before, I think we'll probably hit the low point in the Lower 48 unconventional in the second quarter. If you look at where we'll end up, if you look at 2017 versus 2016 Lower 48 unconventional volumes, I actually expect we'll still be down between 5% and 10% year-to-year. We were down 5% in 2016 versus 2015.","But if you look fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, 4Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016, I expect we'll be up 5% to 10% in the fourth quarter versus the prior fourth quarter. But even that doesn't really reflect this rig rate. If I reference you back to our Analyst Meeting, we gave you that handy-dandy decoder ring \u2013 Ellen tells me it's slide 55 in case you want to check \u2013 but if you look on there \u2013 If you look on there at 11 rigs we'll average, actually, a little less than 11 rigs this year. But of course you have to get to steady state on the rigs, which we're certainly not at yet before you get the kind of things that are on that slide 55.","But 11 rigs gives you between 10% and 15% compound annual growth rate in our Lower 48, in our big three, from the low point this year. So once we get to a steady state, assuming we do with that kind of rig level, that's what you should expect from us, is in the kind of 10% to 15% annual growth in our big three areas at these kind of rig rates.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Very helpful.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Ryan, and I'll go ahead and wrap things up here. By all means, if there are any additional questions feel free to ring into IR. Christine, thanks for moderating for us, and thanks to all of our participants. I appreciate your time and interest.","Operator","Thank you, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Christine. Hello to everyone and welcome to the third quarter call. With me today are Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects. Our cautionary statement is shown on page","two of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refers to estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors noted on this slide and in our periodic SEC filings.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today. These help facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. For any non-GAAP measures that we use, we provided a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure, that can also be found on our website.","One final note before we jump in, as most of you know, ConocoPhillips will hold our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10 \u2013 that's just around the corner. At that time we'll provide an update on our strategy and our 2017 operating plan. So we will not be addressing those topics on today's call. And then as always, during Q&A if you would, please limit your questions to one and a follow-up.","And now I'll turn the call over to Don.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Ellen. I'll start by covering a few highlights from the third quarter and Al will close with more on our operational results and what to watch for through the remainder of the year. I'll begin on slide four with a summary of the third quarter.","We had a strong operational quarter, and again exceeded the high end of our production guidance range, delivering 4% underlying production growth year-over-year. We safely completed an active turnaround season and achieved a major milestone with the startup of Train 2 at APLNG.","Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $826 million. We generated $1.23 billion of operating cash flow excluding working capital. It's notable that during the third quarter, operating cash flows covered capital spending and dividends.","Cash flow in the quarter was also negatively impacted by about $230 million from special items related to rig termination cost and severance expenses. So if you take the clean number and adjust it to today's prices of about $50 a barrel, then on an annualized basis, that would be about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow, which is about what we would expect. Again, sufficient to cover sustaining capital and dividends.","Looking at operating cost, we continued to drive cost down and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating cost compared to the third quarter of 2015. Most of these reductions are structural and continued to lower the overall breakeven price of our business.","With respect to strategic objectives in July, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, which is part of our ongoing exit from deepwater exploration. We also reached agreement on the sale of our Block B assets in Indonesia. We expect both of these sales to close before the end of the year.","Earlier this month, we retired $1.25 billion of maturing debt and expect to end the year with debt a little over $27 billion. I'll go through our third quarter financial results on slide five.","While we operated well this quarter, low commodity prices continued to impact financial results. For the quarter, with an average realized price just under $30 per barrel, we reported an adjusted loss of $826 million or $0.66 per share.","Year-over-year, adjusted earnings decreased as the result of a 9% drop in realized prices and lower equity affiliate earnings. Sequentially, adjusted earnings benefited from a 7% improvement in realized prices, mainly driven by improved North America natural gas prices, as well as higher contract LNG prices. Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide and are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.","I'll cover production on slide six. Last year's third quarter volumes were 1,554 MBOE per day or 1,484 MBOE a day when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of less downtime, production increased by 56 MBOE a day, representing 4% year-over-year growth. That increase came primarily from higher volumes at APLNG and in the Canadian Oil Sands. Those increases were partially offset by a 28,000 BOE per day decrease in natural gas, primarily in North America, bringing us to the 1,557 MBOED for the third quarter. Al will provide more color on third quarter operating performance.","If you turn to slide seven, I'll cover year-to-date cash flow. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date we've generated $3.1 billion from operating activities excluding operating working capital. Total working capital has been a use of cash of $600 million. Proceeds from asset sales have generated $400 million, debt has increased by $3.8 billion but this number will decrease for the full year once we include the $1.25 billion repayment we made in October. Capital spending year-to-date has been $3.9 billion and after dividend payments of around $900 million, we ended September with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.","So financially we are very well-positioned. We've made good progress on driving the business to cash flow neutrality and on improving our balance sheet since the first quarter. I look forward to providing more detail on our financial plans next month in New York.","Now, I'll turn it over to Al to take you through our operational performance.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights starting on slide nine. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts for the rest of the year, including updated guidance for capital and adjusted operating costs.","Third quarter production averaged 1,557 MBOED, which exceeded the high end of guidance. The beat was driven by better-than-expected performance in Canada, Norway, lower 48 unconventionals and Malaysia.","We completed some significant turnaround activities in Alaska and Europe during the quarter, which brings an end to our major turnarounds for the year. We continue to see some production resiliency in the lower 48 unconventionals despite the fact that we've been running only three rigs for the majority of the year, although we do expect more decline in the fourth quarter.","Now that APLNG Train 2 has started up, the major project capital roll off that we have been experiencing is essentially complete. So we've been working to shift more of our capital spending to the lower 48 unconventionals. We've already been able to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping crews at attractive rates to maintain our low cost of supply, so we expect this incremental drilling work to start ramping in November. This work will have no impact on 2016 volumes but will give us a head start on our 2017 production.","In Canada, Surmont fully recovered from the impact of the wildfires earlier this year and achieved a milestone of more than 100,000 barrels a day of gross production in mid-October. We're on track to exit this year at over 110,000 barrels a day gross as we continue to increase toward our 150,000 barrels a day gross capacity.","In Australia, we achieved first production from Train 2 at APLNG in September, and have again experienced a very smooth startup, which allowed us to begin delivering cargoes with Train 2 LNG in early October. We also have several conventional projects underway across the portfolio that are expected to come on production over the next couple of years. Alder and Clair Ridge in the UK, Aasta Hansteen in Norway, Malikai in Malaysia, and additional phases at Bohai in China as well as GMT1 and 1H NEWS in Alaska.","So moving to slide 10, I'll provide an update of our 2016 full-year guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we've hit the trifecta. We increased production guidance based on robust production year-to-date while at the same time lowering both capital and adjusted operating cost guidance. We're driving strong execution and are focused on improving every aspect of our business. And we're not done with our improvements, there's more to come.","We've revised full-year production guidance to a range of $1,560 MBOED to 1,570 MBOED, that's up 10,000 barrels a day from prior guidance at the midpoint, reflecting our strong third quarter performance. Fourth quarter production guidance is 1,555 MBOED to 1,595 MBOED.","We're lowering our capital guidance by $300 million from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion. Even though we're beginning to add rigs in the lower 48 as I just mentioned. Our efforts to reduce operating cost across the business are also succeeding. We're lowering our adjusted operating cost guidance by $200 million from $6.8 billion to $6.6 billion.","As you can tell, we're continuing to improve the company's breakeven price and deliver strong momentum going into 2017. So that was a very, very quick recap of the third quarter. We look toward to giving you a deep dive of our portfolio and providing our 2017 operating plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10.","So now I'll turn the call over for Q&A related to the quarter.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everybody. It's going to be interesting to see how many of us can stay on the quarter but we'll have a go. Okay. So, Al, this year I think you talked about major capital spending being around $1.5 billion. I'm just curious, when we look at the maintenance capital, and obviously that theoretically rolls off next year, is that the kind of level we should be thinking about in terms of what pivots to unconventional spending per your comments in the quarter?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, Doug, nothing's really changed from what I've said about this the last couple quarters. The $1.5 billion was sort of the roll off amount. About $1 billion of that was from some mega projects finishing up and about $0.5 billion was deepwater related. And some of that I've said in the past will roll into some other mid-cycle type projects that are coming up and the rest will tend to roll into lower 48 unconventionals. So I do expect that a fair chunk of that is going to go into lower 48 unconventionals in 2017 and that's what you see us kind of starting now. As that work has rolled off, we've gotten ourselves ready.","First, we went out and checked the market to see what kind of pricing we could get on rigs and frac crews. And provided that we still could get attractive rates similar to what we've been getting all year long, we were interested in getting started with that. And that's what we have found and so we've done that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","How many rigs are you at right now in the lower 48?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, as of right now we're still at the three rigs that we've been running all year. We have contracts now to add five more, and so I expect that we'll be at eight before the end of the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. My follow-up is for Don, if I may. So, Don, I just want to get clarification on your opening remarks. I'm sure you'll get into this in a couple weeks' time, you did hit cash breakeven in the third quarter. You were pretty close in the second, but you're talking about a $50 oil number in your opening remarks as covering dividends and spending when the target is $45. Can you just close the gap or us?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Doug, I mean, if you look back to the third quarter and our reported CFO was about $1.2 billion, then I mentioned the special items. So when we look at sort of the underlying performance of the business, ex recurring items and adjusted for timing effects, reclassifications of liabilities and things like that, we kind of look at it as about $1.5 billion. So that's what we are saying, that we get to \u2013 when you adjust it up from $46, which was the marker price for the third quarter, Brent, up to about $50 and you annualize all that, then we're looking about a $6.5 billion type of run rate at a $50 Brent marker.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","I don't want to labor this point, but I guess why \u2013 the target is $45, right, to cover CapEx and dividends? And ex the adjustments you just pointed out, you were at $1.5 billion, why do you \u2013 what's the gross up to $50 all about. I don't understand why that is coming into the picture when you're up $1.5 billion in the second and third quarter?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Yes, I may not be following you fully on that. We were just trying to take the third quarter and adjust it to today's prices, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","I'll take it offline. We'll get into it in a couple weeks. Thanks a lot, guys, appreciate it.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Okay.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Quick question here on asset sales, in the quarter I don't think there was anything particularly notable, but how do you think about the potential for larger scale asset sales in the portfolio, and then how does that compare to the $1 billion to $2 billion that you talked about previously?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, Neil, I mean, you're familiar with our history since the spin, we've been pretty active in managing the portfolio. I think up through 2015 we had generated about $16 billion in asset sales. And then with the falling prices and the soft market, we backed off and said we'd done most of the strategic things we wanted to do and we kind of set sort of a status quo, business as usual goal of maybe $1 billion to $2 billion, in a really weak market, maybe more towards the $1 billion, which is sort of what we've guided toward this year, in a better market, maybe $2 billion. I think as prices recover then we continue to look at the portfolio for opportunities. And so we get a little more interested in asset sales in a recovering market than the one that we've been in the last couple years.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Appreciate that. And then, in terms of the capital spending number, you continue to impress us on this point. It's now down to $5.2 billion, there has been multiple times you've been able to do this while simultaneously raising production. Just in terms of where you've been able to drive that delta, can you kind of comment on the underlying drivers of it and how much of this is related to more cyclical type of deflation as opposed to gains that you can hold on a more sustainable basis?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, Neil, just to recap where we've been, we started out the year with a $6.4 billion CapEx projection and flat volumes and where we are now is down to $5.2 billion, so down $1.2 billion, and about a plus 3% on volumes once you adjust for dispositions. So that shows you how much progress we've made as we've gone through the year. It's been a combination, as you know, of both the structural work that we've been doing, we've had a very rigorous problem ongoing with a lot of concrete steps to drive down our costs. In addition to the more cyclical side of the deflation that we've been able to capture. And so it started strongest in the U.S. and the lower 48 unconventionals but as we progressed through the year and as that has kind of asymptoted a bit, we're getting bigger savings in the later parts of the year in Alaska, Europe and the Far East, the of the world outside the U.S.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thanks for the color, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Just a couple of quick ones in the quarter. And you all had strong performance in 3Q and everything rolls nice into 4Q. Can you give us a sense of what some of that production outperformance was really driven by? Was it better than anticipated turnarounds? Or was it better well performance that you've seen in the unconventionals? And as a sidebar, could you also provide the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian production if you have that as well?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","You're not allowed to ask Paul's question. All right, we'll let you take that one over for this quarter. Well, the first part of your question, the turnarounds were \u2013 we had some pluses and minuses, overall quite a successful operationally and came about right about on target. So less than 1,000 barrels a day delta from turnaround actuals versus what we had expected.","The increase really has been driven by the lower 48 unconventional, by Canada, the Oil Sands side there, by stronger well performance in Norway and KBB in Malaysia, some better volumes there. Those have been the biggest pieces. A little bit in Alaska, as well with the continuing outperformance from CD5. So it's been \u2013 if I had to put a headline across all of that, I would say it's been really well performance and uptime beyond not so much that planned downtime, but our unplanned downtime has been performing better than expected. So uptime has given us a little boost, but primarily just well performance.","In terms of the \u2013 let me give you the actual numbers on the \u2013 first, if you look at the total lower 48 unconventional last quarter, we were at 262 MBOED in the second quarter. Third quarter came in at 259 MBOED, so down 3,000 (sic) 3 million barrels a day. The three big pieces of that, just because we got to get Paul Cheng's fell question in here, Eagle Ford was 171 MBOED in second quarter, it was down 8 MBOED to 163 MBOED. The Bakken went from 64 MBOED in the second quarter to 61 MBOED in the third quarter, down 3 MBOED and then the Permian was an offsetter, it was plus 8 MBOED. The Permian shale went from 13 MBOED to 21 MBOED for a plus 8 MBOED. So that \u2013 and everything else was flat, our other unconventional lower 48, so that's why the total added up to minus 3 MBOED. Minus 8 MBOED in the Eagle Ford offset by a plus 8 MBOED in Permian and a minus 3 MBOED in Bakken.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great color. The Permian jump is a bit of surprise. Is that pretty much non-operated stuff? You all haven't been doing any completions there recently, have you?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Actually, it mainly has been operated, actually. We've had some very nice wells there in both our Red Hills and our China Draw area. The timing of our completions and our hookups and our gas plant access have driven some shift there and when some of the volumes have come on into the third quarter.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, okay. Thanks for that color. And then a follow-up question. APLNG, Train 2 is now online, is Train 1 still outperforming, are you seeing similar indications with Train 2 in early days and I'm assuming you're still selling those excess cargoes at spot. Is that correct?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. So Train 2 actually started making LNG in late September, had a very smooth startup as we were able to get to first cargo, I think October 8 was the official date, really been ramping up with no issues there. Train 1 continues to run very well at more than 10% over the nameplate capacity. So where we're headed next there is that we're now, we're focused on the upstream side, on ramping our gas supply to be able to run both trains at full capacity. We're not at that point yet. I expect it will be sometime in the second quarter before we have enough gas supply from the upstream side to be able to run both trains at full tilt. And that's when we'll be looking to do our Train 2 lenders' test. We've completed the lenders' test on Train 1. Train 2, tentatively thinking around May or so that we'd be in a position to run that test. Just to give you an idea, year-to-date, we've now shipped over 50 cargoes from APLNG.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Just following up on the lower 48 commentary, the five additional rigs, where do you expect those to go, and then generally I guess, how are you thinking about the exit rate on production and what the rig additions could mean for 2017?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I mean, this is, of course, using this roll off CapEx to move to lower 48 unconventional in 2017 is not a change in plan for us. This timing, taking advantage of today's rates to get started a little earlier in 2016 is a little bit of a shift, but where we're \u2013 we are adding in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken. So we have the three rigs, there's been two in Eagle Ford, one in Bakken. We're going to add three rigs in the Bakken and two rigs in the Eagle Ford, so that we'll be four rigs and four rigs. So that eight rigs that I mentioned earlier we expected to be at at the end of the year will be four rigs in the Bakken, four rigs in the Eagle Ford. We will be looking to add rigs in our Permian acreage in 2017, but that's not part of this late 2016 effort.","In the Bakken, we've been fairly steady there on our progress in terms of recoveries and cost, but recently we've put a new completion design into place that we're going to talk more about at our Investor Day. And so we're really pretty excited. That's part of why we're eager to get some rigs back to work in the Bakken.","In the Eagle Ford, if you look at our cost of supply there, we've got such a huge segment that's got down in below $25 fully burdened cost supply, single well cost supply in the mid-teens, and so who wouldn't want to go run more rigs there in the Eagle Ford? And so that's where we've got those extra rigs allocated, in those two places right now.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, and any and thoughts on the impact this could have on production for next year relative to where the exit rate might be?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, I mean, it's not going to change the exit rate in 2016. We won't get any volumes from these five extra rigs in 2016, but it just fits in with our plan for 2017. We're going to talk more about that at our Investor Day here in a couple of weeks, and we'll show you quite a bit more detail around how we expect all that to come out. I'll save that for then.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, good morning. And congrats on cash and just on the CapEx inflation-deflation debate again, 20% of your CapEx I think in Q3 was really in the lower 48 and obviously there's still projects in the international side but costs are sort of still coming down as you said in the international area. So maybe just \u2013 maybe a sense of how much further deflation you think is possible on that chunk of underlying project sort of CapEx that you guys have?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","We, if we look just that deflation now, not talking about some of our other efforts to drive down cost, but just the \u2013 we have a pretty rigorous tracking system for trying to keep track of the structural and the cyclical and look at the deflation side. We achieved about $1 billion of savings, that's CapEx and OpEx, from deflation last year versus 2014. And we're on track in 2016 to get almost another $1 billion in 2016 versus 2015 of deflation savings. And even though there has been some shift geographically, if you look at how we've been capturing that, we look at it every month. It's been fairly ratable across the year, there's just been some shifting in geography.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then as you think about allocating rigs to North America, as everyone else is starting to do, I mean, what type of inflation assumptions do you think it's prudent for investors to think about?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, I mean, as I hinted at a minute ago, so far we have not seen any increases in cost in these rigs or pressure pumping crews as we've gone back and that's part of what's driven us to move ahead. I think we have a ways to go where we'll be in that situation. We're also helped somewhat by the fact that we're, as I said earlier, focused on places like the Eagle Ford where a lot of the other folks have left and the rigs are down 85% from where they were, and everybody is busy flogging the Permian. And so that actually makes it easier to continue to get good logistics and infrastructure costs and net backs and contracts in the Eagle Ford. So we do assume in our plans that there will be some reflation as we move over the next couple of years if prices improve. But we haven't seen any of that so far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could follow up on one on the CapEx, your run rate on CapEx during the second half of 2016 has been impressive, running probably at an annualized rate of around $4.5 billion a year, certainly below the kind of the $5 billion plus number that you've suggested in the past as sustaining CapEx. Has there been any change in your expectations for sustaining CapEx as we look going forward? Or is this just a sign as I guess the 4Q budget is a little bit of an indication of acceleration in capital as we head into 2017?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, we'll talk about this more at the Analyst Day, but the fact is that our stay-flat run rate has continued to come down. Every time we look at it in detail again, we find a lower number. If you look at our run rate through three quarters of CapEx this year it's at $3.9 billion and the $5.2 billion is exactly ratable with that, that we're projecting. I just want to be clear about one thing so that nobody gets the wrong impression. When we talk about adding these five rigs back and rotating some of this major project and deepwater CapEx over to the unconventional, I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression that that hints in any way at an increase in CapEx for us next year versus this year. That's certainly not what we have in mind, and we're going to \u2013 you'll see a plan at our Investor Day that continues to show strong discipline in the way that we're spending our capital.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on the quarter. Any color on the resilient performance of the U.S. onshore volumes? Is that just lower than expected declines? Or have you adjusted completions and that's driving improved productivity? Anything you can share there?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. It really is as we continue to use our latest technology, latest things we've learned from our stimulated rock volume work \u2013 I'm going to show you some of that at the Investor Day. We continue to get better recoveries and better production for longer from these wells. So it's all about well performance and better IPs and slower declines than what we had put into our plans back when we set up the budget a year ago.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, I'll do you the favor of sticking to kind of Q3-Q4 things and save all the fun for two weeks. Don, I'd like to ask you as we think about cash flow and the impacts of deferred taxes going against you, at what point given sort of a flat CapEx outlook for next year at a minimum it sounds like, should we expect that to come back around and be a favorable tailwind instead of a headwind?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Well, I think it's going to be a while, Roger. I mean it's going depend on prices. And between \u2013 if you think about prices between $50 and $60, you've got a number of operating areas, tax jurisdictions that are flipping back and forth between tax paying and not tax paying position. So if prices were to stay about where they are or in that $50 to $60 range, I don't think you're going to see a substantial change. So I think the guidance we've given on trying to estimate cash flow is probably legitimate, still within that range, and that is to take the earnings sensitivities that we've given you and gross them up for the effective tax rate, put it on a pre-tax basis.","It's going to be a while as I mentioned before, I think, in North America and the U.S. and Canada before we move into a tax paying position. So I would take those earning sensitivities and divide by, say, 0.65. And that's going to keep you pretty close within that price range that I mentioned.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess the other main thing, and you've covered this to some degree with adding the rigs, but what should we think about in terms of the lower 48 CapEx? Clearly, $1.75 billion here in the third quarter going up and adding the rigs, but does \u2013 the number we see in Q4 probably a pretty good run rate? Or as you mentioned, if you do add some rigs in other regions like the Permian, it's more of a steady increase? And I kind of apologize for saying I'm not going to ask about 2017, but I'm just generally trying understand as we think about $5.2 billion this year and next, kind of regionally how we should think about that?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. Okay. You did violate your own rule there. But we will get into that, Roger, in a couple weeks. But as I've already said, we are going to be rolling more into the Lower 48 unconventional. So without talking about the absolute amount, there is going to be a continued shift beyond what we're just doing here at the end of the year into the Lower 48 unconventional. And there's going to be plenty of room to do that without having to increase CapEx. And that follows the plan that we've been really talking about all year with the CapEx roll off.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon...","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Morning, Paul. So now what are you going to do when they've already asked your question for you?","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent. So I ask other things. Two questions, actually. Al, when you negotiate the contract, the five rigs, have you been able to get, say a fixed rate for the next two years or three years? Is that kind of, the option is available that you can lock in for a longer period of time at this point to take advantage of the low price?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Paul, we did explore that with a lot of our different business partners that we work with looking at who might be willing to do that. And we have been able to get some lock in, but nothing like two years to three years. If \u2013 most of the suppliers we were \u2013 all the suppliers we were talking with, if you wanted a lock for that period of time, they wanted a much higher price to start with. So they were willing to lock but it had to be at much higher rate...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","...because of their perception that prices will be that much higher over that timeframe. So we weren't able to get those kind of locks. We were able to lock for shorter periods.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And with the five additional rigs, you're at eight. I think in the past you guys are talking about to keep production flat you need about somewhere in the six rigs to seven rigs. Is that still the kind of number or that I got it wrong, the number?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. No, I don't think that's the number we've talked about in the past. When we first started quoting that number a few years ago, it was in the 15 rigs to 16 rigs range. Earlier this year we talked about 12 rigs to 13 rigs. And, yeah, the eight rigs number you're thinking of may have been just for Eagle Ford alone. I'm really talking about for the L 48 unconventional.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, so...","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","We are going to show you a graph on that at the Analyst Day that really lays out what kind of \u2013 for our total L 48 unconventional how many rigs it will take to stay flat, and what kind of growth rates do you get as you add rigs back? So I've got a whole chart to kind of address that coming up here in a few weeks. But suffice it to say that that number has continued to come down.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. But eight rigs will not keep you flat, yeah?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, we'll see. I'll let you interpolate that off the graph in a couple weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, folks. Good morning.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Just using the midpoint of your production guidance, it looks like we're looking for a decent ramp into 4Q. Al, I know you said lower 48 would probably continue declining so I just want to make sure kind of regionally we have our model calibrated correctly. I think you referenced some turnarounds coming off from Alaska and Europe. So is it fair to think that that's really part of the drivers in addition to your ongoing ramp in like Canada and APLNG?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. I mean, you just hit it all the key pieces really. It's the absence of those turnarounds and the continued ramp on the big projects at APLNG and Surmont and some FCCL as well as Malaysia.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Got it. And then if I could, Don, I wanted to go back to Roger's question, back on the deferred tax. If I'm understanding correctly, the numbers you were using, $6.5 billion, it sounds like that does not contemplate any kind of reversal of the deferred tax. So I guess is it fair to think that your cash flow sensitivities potentially have upside longer-term as the portfolio moves to more of a breakeven posture?","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Yes. Beyond $60, I think that would be right, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.","Donald Evert Wallette - ConocoPhillips","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. Al, I think it's come -","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey how are you doing? It's come across quite clearly that this is a change in rig count that essentially is a sustaining change, that is to say where you've been growing you're not adding rigs, but you are in the areas where you've been declining. And at the same time, I assume that the cost of these rigs is essentially baked in to firstly your lower guidance for this year but also the idea that you're going to hold flat for next year?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. That's right. I mean, I don't know about the whole flat for next year. I think that's a number we'll talk about in a few weeks. I suspect it might even creep down some more. But, yeah, that is built in. The additional \u2013 the $300 million savings, getting down to $5.2 billion on our CapEx guidance for this year includes those costs, although because they're coming on fairly late in the year, it's not a \u2013 it's $100 million to $150 million of additional CapEx from those five rigs coming in late in the year for 2016. But we've got...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","With all the roll off, there's plenty of room to increase rigs in the lower 48 unconventional without any kind of CapEx increases in 2017. And that leaves us in very good shape to be able to hold our production volumes.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. And just to be clear on what you just said when you talk about drifting lower, what you mean is CapEx may yet still drift lower next year?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. You said something about holding CapEx flat.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","No. No.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","I wasn't necessarily agreeing with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask about the Canadian operations. Clearly the production has been holding in very well, but realizations in bitumen prices have been quite low. So I was hoping you could address what type of cash margin that you're actually generating from those businesses in the current price environment?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. I mean, at the current environment \u2013 in the environment we've been in this year, we've been moving back and forth between negative to positive on the cash margin. So we're just breaking into kind of positive territory at these kind of prices.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Great. And then maybe if I could just clarify on some of the earlier comments on the Permian drilling, I might have misunderstood this, but I thought you said that the improvement that you were seeing in the Permian production was coming from your operated activity. I might have misunderstood that, but you don't have any rigs running there right now and you're really not contemplating on adding any, I'm just trying to square where you're getting the production growth?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. It's \u2013 I mean, there might be some amount of non-operated, but it is dominated by operated. And all I was saying, it's just a matter of timing. There were some wells that were drilled previously that even though you're not running rigs there, you've still got things that are being hooked up. We had issues with a third-party gas plant that was down for a while. So as it came back up, we were able to get gas plant access. So it was that kind of \u2013 it's timing of completions, hookup and gas plant access that really allowed those previously drilled wells to come on production and gave us that plus 8 MBOED quarter-to-quarter.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. That's helpful. That squares it.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Hi, everybody.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Doug.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","First, bravo to Al on his disciplined capital allocation point. I like that one. And then second, I wanted to ask another cost question but from somewhat of a different perspective than we talked about so far. Specifically, while it seems that well performance and efficiency gains are going to end up being structural benefits, it also seems that high grading and operational drilling and completion costs are going to be cyclical. And so first, would you agree with these basic cost categories? Or, Al, do you guys think about them differently, meaning am I leaving something out there. And then, second, do you think that the cyclical\/structural cost decline ratio is kind of 60:40, which seems to be an emerging rule of thumb for the industry?","And then finally, how do you think your cost profile is going to change during the next year or so? And the reason I ask is because there are some rumblings out there that service companies are obviously operating at unsustainable margins and something has to give. So three questions, on cost, framework and your expectations.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, so, Doug, I think that that 60:40 rule we're largely in agreement with that. We have as I mentioned earlier a rigorous tracking system to track all these reductions, and when we turn the crank on that system, it says about two-thirds of the savings we've achieved over the last couple years are structural and about one-third cyclical. And then there's the question about the timing of how those come back. Of course, the industry hasn't been through a cycle like this since the onslaught of the unconventional revolution. And so it really remains to be seen just how that ratio is going to turn out.","We're all trying to model in and make some forward projections, but I'm sure we're all \u2013 just as we all learned in our first down cycle in the unconventional, how the lag times were going to work and how the cyclical costs would work. We'll be learning on the upside as well some new ground there. But I know everybody's talking their book about wanting to increase prices and so we'll see what happens there, but I can tell you that we are going to be cost sensitive. It's part of our cost discipline that we are going to be selective in adding back rigs, pressure pumping crews, adding to that North American unconventional work. We don't have to do that and if we get some rapid reflation to where that starts driving up our cost of supply, then we're not going to add those rigs. We're going to stay disciplined in how we do that, maintain our returns focus.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","So, Al, just to be clear, so you think that the decline in cost for you guys was 60% structural, 40% cyclical rather than the other way around? I know that we don't know at this point but is that the way...?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, it's about two-thirds \u2013 our model and our tracking says two-thirds structural, one-third cyclical. And all I'm saying is that it's \u2013 some of that is a bit theoretical because we've never been through this before so we'll see how it really turns out.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you. You've obviously highlighted that accelerating investment into the U.S. lower 48 by adding rigs is a priority here. Is the higher investment into next year almost entirely going to be a lower 48 U.S. unconventional story? Or are there some other international brownfield type investment opportunities that should start to attract capital? And if so, can you discuss those? And can you maybe address where incremental Oil Sands CapEx might stack up for you as you think about next phases for Foster Creek, Christina Lake?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Guy, I got to tell you, that is the perfect question for our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. We're going to address exactly that in some detail and have a whole \u2013 in my section, I've got a whole set of slides to really lay all that out and show you where the capital is going, where the production is coming from, Oil Sands, LNG, our conventional projects, conventional drilling and our unconventional in the U.S. and Canada. So rather than try to front run all that right now, I'll save it for the meeting.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Understood. So my follow-up would be on the topic of the Permian and the growth this quarter. Can you just remind us of the current size of your Permian position as it stands today, the Midland-Delaware split? And also, what's the rationale behind not adding any rigs there this year? Is that just an economics decision? Is it due to the smaller position? Is it infrastructure related? Just trying to understand the thought process there.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, we'll be getting into that at the Analyst Day in quite a bit of detail, also. But we have on the order of 100,000 acres, 110,000 acres in the core part of the Permian. That's both in the Delaware and the Midland Basins. And we've done enough appraisal work there to see that we've obviously got very attractive acreage in the heart of those plays that is going give us excellent economics, just as you hear from everybody else. But we're not in a hurry to go start drilling that up before we completely understand it. If you look at the very disciplined process that we've used in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken where we make sure we understand it; everything from the spacing, to the completion design, to being able to drill with maximum efficiency. Lining all that out before we go before we go out there and just run a whole bunch of rigs drilling is our view of how to develop the asset the most efficiently and create \u2013 and derive the most value from it. And so, we're approaching the Permian in that same way.","And in fact, this rush to the Permian by everybody else has really left us advantaged in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken because we don't have nearly as much competition for suppliers there, for midstream. Everyone in the Permian is worrying now about all the pipes filling up and the plants filling up and not being able to get capacity. And just the way it used to be in the Eagle Ford. These days in the Eagle Ford there's ullage of all kinds and people offering us good deals. And with the exports coming out of Corpus Christi, we're getting good net backs because there's not as much volume flowing out of there, so it's all good in the places where we're at.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","That's a great point. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Just two quick international ones. You're one of the few overseas operators in Libya. We've heard that Libyan volumes have doubled in roughly the last 100 days. Have you noticed any uplift on your assets?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. I can't say much in any detail about Libya overall, but I can tell you about Waha, our asset there. We are \u2013 Waha is producing about 50,000 barrels a day gross right now, which is about 7,000 barrels a day net to us from near zero not very long ago. So that's kind of where we are here in mid to later October. I just should reiterate that none of these Libya volumes are in any of our numbers. We're quoting everything ex-Libya because of all the volatility there. But if we continue to produce at this 50,000 barrel a day gross from our facilities there, it should lead to a first lifting from Es Sider, from the port there, sometime in November.","But there's a tremendous amount of damage and significant challenges repairing infrastructure pipelines, and out in the wellfield. Also at the port and the tankage facilities there \u2013 the pictures from there are just, look like the battle zone that it's been. And so I don't expect that that's going to be able to ramp in a huge way overnight, but we are seeing some volumes coming out now and expect some liftings if it keeps up next month.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP Investor Relations and Communications.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Christine, and thanks to all our listeners.

Really a special thanks to our employees will continue to step up and deliver. We continue to make progress on our divestiture program. Completing this program will improve our portfolio, reset our base for future growth and add financial flexibility to the company.","In the third quarter we generated about $0.5 billion of proceeds from asset sales, including our interest in (inaudible). And we continue to advance our progress on other assets. Year-to-date we have generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions.","A key part of our strategy is to grow organically. Our exploration program continues to build momentum both on the unconventional and conventional sides of the business, and Matt will talk more about these program shortly, but I\u2019m pleased to see these for grabs gaining speed. Operationally, we achieved the high end are estimated production range for the quarter at 1.525 million barrels equivalent per day. This performance represents an important milestone for ConocoPhillips. We achieved 3% year-on-year volume growth when adjusted for dispositions.","Key production highlights include ongoing strong performance from unconventional assets in the lower 48, especially the Eagle Ford and lower oil Sands in Canada. In addition, compared to year ago this quarter benefited from the resumption of production at Peng Lai and in Libya. Our major projects are also progressing as planned, and Matt will provide additional color on these in his comments.","As I move to the financial themes, we generated $1.8 billion of adjusted earnings or $1.44 per share. Our diversified product mix and geographic mix continues to buffer us somewhat from ongoing weaker North American natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding working capital we achieved $3.9 billion in cash from operations. And finally we improved our balance sheet this quarter, lowering the debt-to-cap ratio to 31% from 33%.","So in summary, we had a strong quarter strategically, operationally and financially. We stayed focused and delivered on the aspects of the business that we can control.","Now if you turn to Slide 4, I\u2019ll quickly address the state of the business and how that our focus areas and priorities for the rest of the year and into 2013. First and foremost, the business is running well. We completed our worldwide seasonal turnaround activities on time and on budget. Our major projects and drilling programs are on track to deliver volume and margin growth.","These include our lower 48 and unconventional resource plays as well as our major growth projects in the Canadian oil Sands the North Sea projects in the U.K. and Norway, APLNG and our Malaysian deepwater prospects. These are the major prospects that underpin our long-term goal is to deliver 3% to 5% production growth and margin expansion at flat prices.","As I mentioned a minute ago, our exploration program is continuing to gain momentum. We\u2019re currently testing several unconventional and conventional opportunities and are advancing others quickly to the drill-ready stage. Earlier this week it was announced that we acquired slots in a sixth generation rig to begin executing on our operated deepwater Gulf of Mexico program by 2014.","Again, we are focused on completing our strategic asset disposition program. We have several packages on the market and expects some of these assets will take a little bit of time to divest, but we\u2019re being patient, and we remain committed to getting the program done at acceptable prices. We believe we\u2019re on track to deliver the $8 billion $10 billion of proceeds by the end of 2013.","So with a quarter to go in the year, we now believe our capital spending will come between $15.5 billion and $16 billion a bit lower than we guided to in the second quarter. Where we end up in this range depends on whether or not we find attractive opportunities to add unconventional acreage between now and year end. We continue to be opportunistic in the market for acreage that fits well in our portfolio.","Maintaining our balance sheet strength is essential. We continue to keep a close eye on our financial position to ensure that we have the flexibility and the capacity to execute our plan.","And finally, we remain committed to our stated strategic goals of profitable growth and sector-leading returns. I believe this gives a good quarter and gives good evidence that we\u2019re executing on the parts of the business that we control and have projects and programs in hand to support these goals.","So now let me turn over the call to Jeff for a financial review.","Jeff Sheets","Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start out the review of our third quarter results with Slide 5 which shows our total adjusted earnings and prices. Will go through the detail in each of our segments in subsequent slides and I\u2019ll defer the operational detail and updates to Matt.","Total adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion this quarter compared to $1.5 billion in the prior period and $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 adjusted earnings excludes special items related to net gains on asset dispositions, changes to tax laws in the U.K., pension settlement expenses and some other items. Details of these special items can be found in the supplemental data provided with our earnings release.","Our production came at the high end of the estimate we provided last quarter. Total sales volumes for the quarter were in excess of production resulting in a favorable impact to earnings of approximately $80 million, and we\u2019ll discuss these details as we go through the segments.","Sequentially prices weren\u2019t a huge driver in earnings. North American gas and bitumen prices increased while domestic crude and NGL prices decreased. Despite increases this quarter, North American natural gas prices remained challenged and this impact \u2013 we continue to offset this impacted by shifting our investment towards liquids production. Operating costs were consistent with our expectations.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and talk about our total production. Production of 1.525 million BOE per day was in line with our expectations. Stepping to the waterfall, dispositions reduced production by 53,000 BOE per day compared to the third quarter of last year. The dispositions included Vietnam, step here at Alba and some Western Canadian gas assets that as the Naryanmarneftegaz joint venture.","Down time was heavier than normal this reducing production by 49,000 BOE per day compared to the same quarter last year. We had major turnarounds this quarter in Alaska and in the U.K.","Growth more than offset base decline, accounting for 256,000 BOE per day of new production with the majority of the growth coming from the lower 48 shale plays and our oil sands assets. We also had considerable production increases over these periods from Libya and China.","In summary, volumes were up 3% adjusted for dispositions, but importantly the 3% growth was largely driven by a 7% increase in liquids production as shown on the dark blue bars on the slide. As we announced though this morning, we now expect our full year 2012 production volumes to average between 1.57 million and 1.58 million BOE per day.","Now I\u2019ll turn to the segment slides beginning with the lower 48 and Latin America on Slide 7. Production in this segment was 462,000 BOE per day this quarter, an increase over prior periods as we continue to successfully ramp up production in our lower 48 shale plays. Total liquids production in the segment increased 21% over the same period a year ago while natural gas production decreased 3%.","A year ago liquids represented 40% of our production in this segment. In the third quarter 2012 liquids increased to approximately 46%. We expect this liquids percentage to continue to grow and drive our margin expansion over time.","During the quarter production was 76,000 per day it Eagle Ford with 79% liquids and 29,000 BOE per day in the Bakken with 88% liquids. Total production of 102,000 BOE per day from these two plays has doubled compared to the same period last year. Compared to the second quarter the increased liquids production along with the 26% increase in realized gas prices contributed positively to earnings in this segment while continued declines in NGL prices negatively impacted earnings. Despite the sequential increase in natural gas prices, the segment earnings continued be impacted by generally weak natural gas prices.","Next we moved to the Canada segment on Slide 8. Canadian production was 277,000 per day in the third quarter with the growth over prior periods being driven by the ramp-up at our oil-sands assets. Liquids production increased 30% year-over-year, while gas price decreased by 6%. And this shift will show up as improved margins over time. Canada reported negative adjusted earnings this quarter, largely reflecting ongoing weak natural gas prices.","However, earnings were improved compared to the second quarter as natural gas and bitumen prices improved quarter-over-quarter. We also saw the WTI, WCS differential improve late in the quarter and the price of diluan decrease and this resulted in an overall improvement in pitchman netbacks. And it should be noted that despite the negative earnings the Canada segment continues to generate strong cash flow.","Now let\u2019s move to the Alaska segment on Slide 9. Production in Alaska was 176,000 BOE per day this quarter, down 39,000 per day but in line with our expectations. This production decline was largely due to major turnaround activity all across our assets on the north slope. The impact of lower production on earnings was offset by sales from inventory this quarter and these sales from inventories contributed approximately $120 million to the Alaska segment\u2019s earnings. As a result, adjusted earnings of $535 million were roughly equivalent to the prior quarter and improved from a year ago.","I\u2019ll now turn Slide 10 and talk about the Asia Pacific and the Middle East segment. Asia Pacific and Middle East continue to be a strong performer for ConocoPhillips and provides important diversification to our portfolio. Production in the segment was 306,000 BOE per day during the third quarter.","Both the Vilumunden field and they Darwin Allen Value plant were fully online this quarter after being down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Production continue to ramp up at Peng Lai, increasing 20,000 BOE per day over the prior quarter. We exited the quarter with net production of 45,000 BOE per day and we expect to maintain this level of production during the fourth quarter. However, we had again in Alaska on the left side from sales of inventory. Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings were adversely impacted by about $60 million related to lift timings.","Europe\u2019s our next segment and we\u2019ll just cover that on Slide 11. Production from the Europe segment was 191,000 per day during the quarter, a sequential decrease of 45,000 per day. Natural-field declines, down-time, and asset dispositions contributed to the lower production this quarter. Down-time resulted in 28,000 BOE per day impacts, primarily from planned maintenance at the Duty, east IVC, and Britannia platforms.","The majority of production that was off-line during the third quarter due to down-time should be back online during the fourth quarter. The disposition impact was about 8,000 per day from Startured and Alba. So adjusted earnings of $299 million declined versus the prior quarter, primarily due to the slower production. It\u2019s important to note that we benefit in the portfolio sense from having exposure to the stronger pricing in this segment.","Now I\u2019ll cover our next and final geographic segment, the Other International on Slide 12. So I\u2019ll remind you that this segment includes our assets in Russia, the Caspian and Africa. Production was 113,000 BOE per day, basically maintaining the same level of production that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters since Libya came back online.","Adjusted earnings of $124 million this quarter were helped by favorable settlements of certain tax items. Prior-quarter earnings were negatively impacted by higher taxes, exploration expense, and adverse foreign-exchange impacts. The earnings were also impacted by the sale of NMNG in mid-August. So at the time of the sale, NMNG was producing about 11,000 BOE per day and was diluted to earnings.","The final reporting segment I\u2019ll cover quickly is our Corporate and Other segment on Slide 13. Adjusted corporate expense during the quarter was $139 million. This is lower corporate expense then we expect to see going forward as the quarter benefited from licensing revenue as well as some favorable foreign-exchange impacts. For the company overall, total foreign exchange was not a factor in the total quarter\u2019s earnings. For the year, we estimate this segment\u2019s expense on an adjusted basis to be about $850 million. We repaid $2 billion of debt during the quarter bring the total debt outstanding to $21.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, total debt-to-cap was 31%, and our long-term target remains to be 25% to 30% range.","If you turn to Slide 14 I\u2019ll cover our operating segment margins and returns. Charts on this slide summarizes our key financial metrics for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis all four metrics were negatively impacted by lower North American prices as well as our overall realize price declined by about $5 per BOE compared to the third quarter of last year.","Our income and cash contribution per BOE were helped this quarter by the inventory sales in Alaska, but also reflected the operational and portfolio improvements that we\u2019re starting to make as a company, and over time we expect these metrics to improve as we deliver on our growth programs, our margin expansions and our continued focus on returns.","So I\u2019ll wrap up my remarks on Slide 15, which is our third quarter company cash flow. As Ryan mentioned in his opening comments, we generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations is quarter excluding working capital. Working capital was a $412 million use of cash. We also generated $522 million proceeds from asset dispositions. We funded a $3.7 billion capital program bringing our year-to-date capital program to $11.9 billion. We paid out roughly $800 million of dividends and reduced debt by about $2 billion.","During the quarter excluding working capital our cash from operations and proceeds from dispositions funded our dividend payments our capital program, and we used our restricted cash to pay down debt. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash equivalents and restricted cash. Our balance sheet and financial situation remains strong. We\u2019re well-positioned execute on our program. Importantly we have capacity and flexibility to fund the programs that will generate volume and margin growth going forward.","That concludes the review of our financial results, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll take us back through our operating segments and provide some detail on our drilling programs, growth projects and both our conventional and unconventional exploration activities. I\u2019ll cover some highlights from the third quarter, but also update you on current activities and provide some color of what expect in the near future. I\u2019ll start with the lower 48 and Latin America segment on Slide 16.","First, I\u2019ll focus on two key areas, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. In the Eagle Ford we have about 230,000 net acreages, and our acreage is largely located in the Condensate Fairway, which the industry recognizes as the best part of the play. We have 14 rigs running in the play today. In the third quarter our production averaged 76,000 BOE per day, and we achieved a peak production rate and 86,000 BOE per day.","In the fourth quarter we expect to achieve the peak rate of 100,000 a day as we continue to drill and pick up wells. And we are actively adding infrastructure in the play to create value. For example, we\u2019re adding stabilization facilities, like the ones shown on the top left, to remove light ends, maximize our light crude sales at pipeline spec and to maximize or capture of NGLs.","We should have an entire Eagle Ford possession held by production by the end of 2013, and that\u2019s important because it allows us flexibility to find new technologies and thoughtfully determine the most capital efficient way.","Switching now to the Bakken, we have more than 620,000 acres in this liquids rich play that\u2019s all held by production. We exited the quarter with the production rate of 26,000 BOE per day, and as a result of incremental takeaway capacity from new rail facilities, we\u2019ve ramped up from five to eight rigs, and we\u2019ll see the benefit of this increased activity in the fourth quarter and in 2013.","We also have significant exploration activity underway in other unconventional plays in the lower 48, including the Wolfcamp and the Delaware and Midland Basins, the Avalon Shale, the Louis Shale in Wyoming, the Niobrara and the Mancos in the San Juan Basin. We expect our results in these place by early next year. And I should note that these are just a few of the opportunities we\u2019re evaluating in our vast lower 48 land possession. We continue to identify other potential plays where we can acquire unconventional acreage at the low entry prices.","Moving onto Conventional Exploration, we have some significant activities underway in the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater and continue to build a portfolio of future opportunities there. Just for some context, we have 1.5 million Deepwater acres in the Gulf making ConocoPhillips the sixth largest Deepwater acreage holder there. Our initial strategy for this area has been to participate in non-operated wells by building a COP operated portfolio.","Currently we\u2019re building two non-operated wells, the Coronado prospect and the Shenandoah appraisal well. We\u2019re also just about to spud a third well, Humber. It\u2019s a supply and exploration well. And we anticipate four additional exploration wells spudding in 2013 along with the Tyber appraisal well. And the potential for additional appraisal wells exist if we have success with our exploration wells. So we\u2019re really excited about our 2013 program in the Gulf of Mexico.","Our long-term strategy is to build an attractive operated lease position that will allow us to drill three to six wells a year. And to advance our operating program that was announced on Tuesday that we\u2019ve secured access to a new Deepwater drillship to use across our operated portfolio starting in 2014.","Please go to Slide 17 and we\u2019ll talk about the Canada segment. Our oil sands assets in Canada are a big part of our growth story. In fact, we are currently the second largest SAGD producer in Canada with 23% of total SAGD production. And our assets continue to perform well. Christina Lake, Phase D reached first production in July, three months ahead of schedule. Foster Creek is performing well. And Surmont Phase I achieved record production in September. As a result, third quarter bitumen production was 92,000 barrels per day net, after royalty. And we expect production to average over 100,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.","Continued expansion in FCCL is ongoing and construction of Surmont Phase II is progressing towards first production in 2015. Surmont is a large-scale development. When it\u2019s ramped up to full production the project will produce at a gross annual average rate of 110,000 BOE per day, equivalent to about 3 typical FCCL phases. And we continue to expand. For example, the sanction the Narrows Lake Phase A and Christina Lake Phase F are anticipated by year-end.","The application of new technology is critical to the development of SAGD because it can add significant value due to the size of our resource base there. So we\u2019re starting an enhanced SAGD pilot in November. And we\u2019re actively testing several other technologies that will increase rates and reduce steam\/oil ratio.","Moving to our Western Canada business unit, here our drilling program is focused on liquids rich and light oil opportunities in our portfolio. And we\u2019re also drilling or planning exploration wells in several of our unconventional plays in Canada including the Duvernay, Montney and Horn River. In addition to that, we\u2019re preparing for a winter exploration program in the Canol oil play in the Northwest Territories where we hold more than 200,000 net acres. And like the lower 48, we hold a significant amount of land throughout Western Canada that\u2019s held by production. And we believe some of this acreage could be prospective for additional tight oil and share liquid plays.","So let\u2019s finish out North America with Alaska on Slide 18. Major turnarounds were successfully completed at Kuparuk, Britto and Alpine this quarter. In fact, Kuparuk was completed 14 days ahead of schedule. In October the ConocoPhillips Board approved the North Slope\u2019s Alpine West project also known as CD5. The project is now pending patent approval, which we expect in November and production will start from Alpine West in 2016.","As you may seen in the press, we\u2019re working with the other producers in Alaska to evaluate LNG exports from the North Slope. The Producer group has been focusing on narrowing down development concepts and assessing the cost of the major project components. In the Chukchi Sea we\u2019re targeting drilling the Devil\u2019s Four prospect in 2014. Now this prospect is in the 155 feet of water. So it can be drilled with a jack-up break with service BOPs and a prepositioned capping device on the seafloor.","We continue to invest around $1 billion a year of net capital such as Alpine West and infill drilling programs across the North Slope. Significant additional oil development and opportunities exist contingent upon more competitive state fiscal counts.","So let\u2019s move to Slide 19, the Asia Pacific & Middle East segment. We produce more than 300,000 barrels per day from this region and it\u2019s an area of significant growth for us over the next five years. We continue to make progress with the Australia Pacific LNG project. The project remains on track with premise, scope and cost and is on schedule for the mid-2015 start up of train one and 2016 start of train two.","Now we track project progress in three main categories here: upstream, midstream and downstream. In upstream all major contracts for gas processing and water treatment plants and associated gathering systems are fully executed and module fabrication and drilling are progressing.","In midstream the main pipeline work is in progress with right-of-way clearing, grading and pipeline streaming proceeding as planned. The downstream development of the LNG at Crackus Island is also proceeding as planned with engineering progress ahead of schedule and all construction access, dredging and mainland facilities completed in third quarter.","At Poseidon Boreas-1 was a successful appraisal well reaching target depth on September 18 with encouraging results. The well was drill stem-tested at just over 30 million cubic feet a date against a flowing tubing head pressure of 3,300 psi. Drilling operations will now begin on the second well of the program in November, and this is part of five-well appraisal program that we will conduct over the next two years.","In the Canning Basin we drilled and cored our first well. The well was drilled to about 12,000 feet, and 1,400 feet of core was collected. This is the first of a three-well program that will be completed by mid 2013.","In China our net production at Peng Lai reach 45,000 BOE per day at the end of the third quarter, and production should remain fairly steady at that level for the remainder of the year. The first well at our Panyu Growth project came on in late September. Current Panyu production is about 8,000 barrels of oil per day net, and this project will add another 8,000 barrels per day between now and 2014 as we drill additional wells from the two new platforms.","We now have four major projects in execution in Malaysia: Gumusut; Seacap, North Bohai; KBB in Malikai which were recently approved. First oil is expected from an early production system at Gumusut in the fourth quarter of this year. SNP in Gumusut full production will start in late 2013. The start up of the others will be staggered between 2014 and 2017. We\u2019re also working on several other project developments in Malaysia and we have the potential to significantly grow this business over the next five to 10 years.","Due to recently renegotiated gas sales contracts in Indonesia we will see significant increases to our realized gas prices for both on the Tennessee Block B, sales to Malaysia and of Corridor block sales to the Indonesian domestic market. Now these price improvements positively impact the value of both assets and increase the attractiveness of additional investment in these PSEs.","Finally in this segment, conventional exploration in Bangladesh. There we\u2019ve completed shifting seismic and we expect to complete the processing this year.","Please turn to Slide 20 and I\u2019ll provide an update on our Europe segment. We are focused on progressing our major projects in Europe. In the U.K. we completed a major turnaround at Judy that included preparing for the tie-in of the Jasmine project, and we installed the associated pipeline and jackets. Development drilling results at Jasmine are exceeding expectations and we expect first oil in the second half 2013.","In the U.K. we\u2019re also planning a five-well exploration and appraisal program at Greater Clair. In Norway we installed jackets, bridges and bridge support for the Ekofisk South project and commenced pre-drilling activities this quarter. We\u2019ve also progressed modifications to existing facilities on Ekofisk and Eldfisk in preparation for tie-in of the new facilities. First production for Ekofisk and Eldfisk II are expected in late 2013 and late 2014 respectively.","In Poland we exercised our option to acquire a 70% interest in Lane Energy and assumed operatorship of three Western Baltic Basin concessions for an additional exploration well that\u2019s currently being drilled.","The final segment I\u2019ll cover Other International on Slide 21. As we mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our 30% interest in NMNG. Our Libya production returned to pre-conflict levels. The third quarter average was 47,000 barrels per day. Additionally the fire and gas seals agreement was executed in early September, and this will result in a production increase of about 4,000 BOE per day for the rest of 2012 and going forward. In Kazakhstan, Caspian production is expected to be online in the first half of 2013.","We completed our seismic on Angola blocks 36 and 37. Air blocks are immediately outboard of the Camia discovery in block 21, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve already seen in the seismic. Drilling is expected to start in 2014.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating the things you\u2019ve heard consistently today. Operationally the team is staying focused on executing the base business while successfully funding our emerging growth programs. We\u2019re also seeing the payoff from the past few years of opportunity catcher, both in our unconventional drilling programs and our conventional major projects. Our expiration team is done a great job, not only building up our opportunity set, but advancing our current inventory to a drill-ready stage. So I echo Ryan\u2019s early comments about how much there is to look forward to over the next few quarters and beyond.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ryan for some closing comments.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Matt. If I could get you up to turn to Slide 22 for some summary comments. The most important takeaway I think from today\u2019s call is that the business is running well and that our plans are on track, and I\u2019m pleased with our performance in our first full quarter as an independent E&P company. We remain highly focused on executing our major projects and our drilling programs, and we\u2019re also building and testing our conventional and unconventional exploration portfolio. I think Matt\u2019s overview should give you confidence that we\u2019re making strong progress on these activities.","We\u2019re also executing on the strategic asset disposition program. When complete, these asset sales will improve our portfolio and create financial flexibility. This flexibility is core to our strategy, and you\u2019ve heard from Jeff that maintaining a strong balance sheet is and remains a top priority. The bottom line, our long-term value proposition remains unchanged. We believe we have the portfolio and the programs to deliver 3% to 5% growth in production and margins with improving absolute financial returns and a sector leading yield. This is our commitment, and we\u2019re on track to deliver it.","We\u2019re also committed to keep you updated on our progress. We expect to announce our 2013 capital budget in December and our year-end reserves and financial results early next year. And finally I\u2019d like to encourage all of you to save the date for our first Analyst Meeting as an independent E&P company. We\u2019ll host our meeting in New York on February 28 and will provide a detailed update of our strategic plans for growth and value creation.","So thank you for your interest and participation this afternoon, and we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) At this time we have a question from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, everyone. Congratulations on the results. It certainly feels that confidence in 2016 growth and that margin improvement is building. I guess I have a question just looking beyond 2016. I mean as you look across the portfolio, do think nonconventional shale is enough? Or what should we focus most on do you think in this sort of pre-drill potential of the offshore portfolio?","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Ed. I appreciate the comments. I think as we look out beyond 2016, that\u2019s the work that we\u2019re alluded to in the operating update is working both on the conventional and in conventional side of the Expiration business. So I think you watch both those spaces globally, in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and in North America, and we hope globally in the unconventional space as well. We\u2019re working that pretty hard right now to load up the inventory for the latter half of this decade.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then a sort of more specific question just coming in on that Eagle Ford, obviously you\u2019ve got some good production performance there. Can you just remind us what acre spacing you\u2019re planning your production on? And any IP targets that are behind that target? Because it feels like if you\u2019re already about 100 about 110,000 barrels a day guidance on 2013 that the well performance or the efficiency or something is changing that means you\u2019re ahead.","Matt Fox","So we have that 230,000 acres in total and we\u2019re currently thinking that the ultimate spacing will be about 80 acres, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning for. And that results in about 1.8 billion BOE associated with the play. But we have pilot tests going on, several pilot tests going on in Eagle Ford where we\u2019re testing different technologies and different spacing. So that might change over time as we learn more. Our IPs have continued to be in the order of 1200 plus barrels a day. And we\u2019re seeing strong IPs compared to the industry average. We think the completions are working well there.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And just to confirm those IPs, what time period?","Matt Fox","30 days.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. Yeah, they would be pretty good. Okay. Thanks very much.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Ed.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Good afternoon, everybody, and congratulations on your results.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Ryan, you mentioned a minute ago that the underlying production growth was 3% in Q3. And it looks like we\u2019re going to have another 3% gain in Q4. So the first question is whether or not that\u2019s your expectation for Q4 as well? And then second, obviously higher production is important. But your profitability and returns were near the highest level of the year during the third quarter as well. So I wanted to see if you could specify some of the functional and\/or geographical drivers behind the improvement in the returns as well?","Ryan Lance","Well, thanks, Doug. Yeah, we gave you kind of a range for the full year and expect us to come kind of in that range pretty well. So you can see the growth is coming in the fourth quarter. And I think as we look across the portfolio, we came out of the turnaround season pretty well. We\u2019ve added rigs in China and Libya, in the Canadian business unit and then the ramp-up in the unconventionals in the U.S. are providing a lot of the production growth that we\u2019re seeing in the third and the fourth quarter. And then those areas are also as we see prices bouncing around, differentials bouncing around as well, those areas have largely led to the income and the margin improvements that we\u2019re seeing as well. Primarily China coming back in the growth and both North American unconventionals and the Canadian oil sands.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay. And then also, administratively, the exit rate for NMNG was 20,000, 25,000 barrels per day. Is that about right?","Ryan Lance","No, the exit rate was probably closer to 11,000 for us.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Oh, okay.","Ryan Lance","So, yeah.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Doug.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John P. Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yes, hi. Just some quick ones. With the Eagle Ford, how long are the laterals? And how many drilled but unfracked wells do you have currently but inventoried?","Ryan Lance","The laterals are typically 5,000 feet. I don\u2019t know how many off the top of my head how many we have drilled and then not hooked up yet. But we have quite a few that we\u2019re waiting to hook up over the next quarter and at the end of Q1.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. That\u2019s great. In terms of your expenditures, if you\u2019re going to split it between conventional and unconventional, is 40% a good estimate for unconventional? It\u2019s CapEx exposure?","Ryan Lance","Yeah, that\u2019s a reasonable next move if we were going under unconventionals in our planning.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. Last one for me is Poland shale. You\u2019ve had other companies exit. Why are you optimistic?","Ryan Lance","Well, we still see potential in that sort of pari-Baltic region of Poland where we\u2019re drilling just now. The time will tell. We\u2019re testing a different part of the play, moving a bit farther north towards the Baltic with the oil that we\u2019re drilling just now. And so we\u2019ll see how that works out.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Thanks, Matt.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. Just right at the end you said something I just wanted to clarify which was that you\u2019re targeting a sector-leading yield? Can you just kind of run through that? Because it\u2019s not actually on the slides that I see.","Ryan Lance","Well, I think as we think about it, Paul, today we\u2019re yielding 4.5% or so, given where our stock price is. And as we think about our peer group as a mix between independents and the major integrates, we think the yield that the dividend will underpin for the stock will be at the upper end of all that peer group. Now some of that European integrates will be a little bit higher, but we are relative to a mix of peers in the integrated and the independent side, we think it\u2019s one that falls at the top end. And it\u2019s an important part of our value proposition. We\u2019re committed to maintaining that kind of a dividend.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So you\u2019re committed to maintaining the yield at the higher end of the range?","Ryan Lance","Well, I mean the yield will \u2013 we expect the stock price to grow, so the yield will probably come down a little bit. We\u2019re committed to maintaining the dividend that we\u2019ve announced and where we\u2019re at today.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","You guys have got an Analysts Meeting next Feb, right? I\u2019m just not quite sure about the dividend policy, because I think you\u2019ve got dividend as your top cash priority, and you have said that you want to grow the dividend, I\u2019m not sure exactly what you said on the percentage aim for that if anything? Then I guess the yield is not, with all due respect, not quite what you meant. Because obviously it would be a different thing if you were targeting a better class or upper range yields.","Ryan Lance","Yeah, so Paul, what we\u2019re talking about is, what we said, is we\u2019ll allocate 20% to 25% of our cash flows on an ongoing basis back to the shareholder and we\u2019ll do that primarily through the ordinary dividend. And we expect over time as our production grows and our margins grow, that our cash flows are going to grow as well, so I think what we say is we ought to expect modest increases in the dividend as we go forward over the next five years and deliver on the program that we\u2019ve outlined to the market. We probably won\u2019t grow as fast as what the dividend has grown over the last ten years in the integrated company, but as we look forward over the next five as our cash flows grow and our margins grows, so shall our cash flows grow. And our commitment to our shareholders remains the same. We\u2019re going to distribute that percentage of our cash back to them.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, that\u2019s great. I understand now.","Ryan Lance","And the yield will be, hopefully the share price will increase and the yield might come down a little bit.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sorry, I was just picking you up on that. But it wasn\u2019t actually written down so I couldn\u2019t be sure. I understand now. Just my second follow-up. Back to the Australia LNG, you kind of started down the road of explaining where we were on costs and progress. Could you just remind us what the total project cost is expected to be, when the critical moments are for activity? If I give you an example, Chevron\u2019s global project will have its peak activity level next Q2 2013? Could you talk about where, if you\u2019d like, where the level of risk lies on the timeframe going forward and where you see the overall project costs? And you began to break that down between your three segments of where the costs lie. Can you talk a bit more around those and I think you talked about the extent to which you were contracted but I was wondering if you could go through some completion levels and so on. Thanks.","Ryan Lance","I\u2019ll let Matt jump in as well. We\u2019re still at a two-train $20 billion project for APL and GMX. That\u2019s upstream, downstream, midstream all combined up. We haven\u2019t seen any indication. That\u2019s with without FX considerations which might move around a little bit over the course of the next four of five years as we complete the scope. I\u2019d say we\u2019re ramping up to peak kind of rates. I think we probably hit there into 2013 and into 2014 is when we start with our peak manpower both on Curtis Island and what we\u2019re doing on the upstream side of the project as well.","Matt Fox","The project is on track in terms of the progress. The critical path\u2019s intact and we\u2019re quite comfortable with the way things are working just now on the APLNG.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And given the critical path, when will be the maximum points of risk over the next coming quarters or whatever?","Matt Fox","As we go through the critical path for example, one of the things on the critical path there any LNG project is typically the LNG tanks themselves and they\u2019re ahead of plan. We basically were to the critical path, there\u2019s always the sort of individual milestones that you want to meet, but we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re on track to do that.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And if we roll that up into the completion numbers so far, where would we\u2019d be? I think you might\u2019ve said that actually, sorry.","Matt Fox","Project completion number as in the capital cost?","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes. Exactly. What percentage is kind of done?","Matt Fox","Percent complete just now for the total project is about 20% I think.","Ryan Lance","20% to 25%.","Matt Fox","Yeah, maybe it\u2019s 22%. But it\u2019s that order of magnitude.","Ryan Lance","Jim?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Ryan Lance","Hello, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Hi. When we look at what\u2019s going on in North America today, there seems to be a lot of asset transactions taking place. I just want to get your guys\u2019 update on acquisitions? I know you\u2019re divestiture plan is fairly straightforward, but I just want to get your update on how you\u2019re thinking about? Also acquisitions, given all the transactions we\u2019ve seen of late? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Ryan Lance","Yeah, thanks, Faisel. I think of the acquisition side we\u2019re mostly focused on acreage acquisitions and have been over the last year so. I think we added a bit over 700,000 net acres to the portfolio in the last year. So what we\u2019re focused on is trying to identify these unconventional plays early so we can be a very early mover and get into more of the ground floor type of opportunity rather than getting in after pilots have been done and the resource then derisked and drilling has started to occur to develop it. The price goes up pretty dramatically when you reach that stage. So our effort has really been focused on the organic side and capturing our opportunities early.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","And in the Gulf of Mexico, are you pretty satisfied with your position? If assets were for sale, would you take a look at them?","Ryan Lance","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever satisfied with our position. We continually look for opportunities to improve it or consolidate our positions and bulk up what we like and farm out what we don\u2019t like.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Understood. And looking at the Eagle Ford and the Bakken positions in your prepared remarks you talked about how you\u2019re developing some infrastructure. What is that infrastructure spend exactly? And when is that going to come to an end over the next, I guess in the future?","Ryan Lance","So this year we\u2019re spending around $600 million or $700 million on infrastructure, I\u2019m not exactly sure what the numbers are for next year, but it\u2019s mostly a 2012-2013 expenditure to kind of build the backbone through our acreage as we develop that whole acreage position.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. If I\u2019m just thinking about the projects that have been sanctioned \u2013 I\u2019m thinking about reserve bookings, it seems like you\u2019ve got some additional sanctioning in Canada. You\u2019ve got the Alpine West you said. And then you also went forward with the second train of APLNG. Are those kind of the big things I\u2019m thinking about? And how would I also think that the Eagle Ford where you have 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in place?","Ryan Lance","So we\u2019ll see reserve bookings at the end of the year associated with the ones that you listed, plus we expect to see our proved preserves in Eagle Ford increase. We also sanctioned the Malikai project in Malaysia, so we\u2019ll see reserves increase there. And there\u2019ll be some puts and takes on various other assets, but those are the major reserve additions that we expect.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Folks, good afternoon. Congratulations on the results. I have a couple for you, one is a little bit more detail, but I noticed the lower 48 natural gas production increased fairly sizably. I\u2019m trying to determine, I know there was gas that was previously shut in. Can you say whether that was a result of that gas coming back on line? Or maybe you could just answer where you stand today with regard to shut-in gas?","Ryan Lance","So we don\u2019t have any significant volume showing at all now. So some of that increase is gas coming back on line, but the majority of it is increases in associated gas production with our liquids-rich plays, for example Eagle Ford.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Second question is on oil sands in general. There\u2019s been an awful lot of press reports on assets being marketed from you guys up there, and I know you are probably unwilling to share too much. But I\u2019m just curious if you could talk in general how the oil sands fits into the portfolio?","Ryan Lance","Yeah, I think the oil sands are important in our portfolio. The important growth of the margins are good and they have a different profile, obviously relative to some of the other assets, but important in complimenting a large portfolio like ConocoPhillips has. We have gone out looking at marketing some of our oil sand positions primarily some of our Surmont. And it\u2019s over 100% acreage we have outside of the area. We\u2019ve got a lot of interest in it. And in fact, we\u2019ve got enough so that we got proposed a number of different structures. So we\u2019re stepping back for a minute and taking a look at what might work best for ConocoPhillips as we think about our options that we have with our position in Canada.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, Ryan. But just to be clear we shouldn\u2019t view that as potentially a full exit out of oil sands, right?","Ryan Lance","No.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. So I\u2019ll slip in one last one, I know you\u2019re in the conceptual phase of ANF gas LNG out of Alaska. Obviously you have a very decent position up in Western Canada there as well. I\u2019m just curious, are you exploring options for LNG exports out of Western Canada? Or are you just really focused on Alaska at this point? Thanks.","Ryan Lance","I\u2019d say we\u2019re mostly focus on Alaska, Mike.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, hi, gentlemen. Sorry, (inaudible) Just a couple questions please, I think you talked about natural gas price improvements coming in Indonesia and Libya. And you can see that your Libyan realization has picked up substantially. So just interested in why that is. And also on the Indonesian side, is that something we\u2019ve got to look forward to? Or is that something which has already happened?","Ryan Lance","On Indonesia it\u2019s really something we have to look forward to and both the Malaysia contracts and the domestic Indonesia contracts, you should start to see those coming through the fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Is that something structural or was it an oil price affect? Or what is that?","Ryan Lance","It\u2019s a renegotiation of the gas contract from Malaysia because Petronas wanted to secure more gas and because the Indonesian government wants to incentivize more development of the domestic production in Indonesia. So they\u2019re moving towards a more market-based pricing. So those are really the drivers.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And what happened and Libya?","Ryan Lance","You mean the fera gas contract, but that didn\u2019t happen until September.","Matt Fox","We had a little bit of that in the third quarter but if you are looking at the realized price per (inaudible) in Libya we started to sell gas under that contract.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Second question is I\u2019m just wondering how you feel about your U.K. North Sea portfolio. You\u2019ve obviously got a couple of developments there. But you\u2019re also I think going to sell some assets with the tax increases, et cetera. Are you kind of net seller now of the U.K. or are you after this disposal, which is in the works? Or is there something else coming?","Ryan Lance","Well, no, I think we\u2019ve been pretty pleased. So the North Sea and the U.K. sector, you\u2019ve got to divide that into three areas, the Central Graven, the stuff we have up west of Shetlands with our Claire interest in the East Ireland Sea and the southern North Sea that we have. We did try to market our southern North Sea position a little bit earlier in the year, but that got hung up with a bunch of changes that were occurring in the government in the U.K. side with taxes and abandonment liability and some of those issues.","But the core area that we still like and remain to think there\u2019s still opportunity there, things like Jasmine developments that tie into our existing infrastructure, so we see additional opportunity off the Brittania platform bringing more wells and additional satellites into production in the Brittania area. And we\u2019re currently exploring in the area for more Jasmine look-alikes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Did you pick up any licenses today, Luc, in the license room?","Ryan Lance","I don\u2019t know if we did. I haven\u2019t been informed if we have or not.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. All right, guys. Thanks very much.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Iain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I have a number of soft questions, hopefully. Matt or Jeff, for the APLNG on the $20 billion, what is the percentage that is the Australian dollar-based and what FX rate are you using in the budget, if you can remind me?","Ryan Lance","It somewhere between 50% and 60% Australian dollar, and I don\u2019t know that we have a particular FX rate that we\u2019re going to quote in the budget.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I see. Matt, how many Matt wells you already drilled in Poland? And is there any result that you can share from those wells?","Matt Fox","We\u2019ve drilled a total of four wells, three in the pari-Baltic region and then we\u2019ve got one more that we\u2019re drilling just now, but I\u2019m not really ready to talk about the results at the time on those wells yet.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I see. Ryan, I know that you don\u2019t give the budget in December. If you\u2019re looking at right now did you expect the budget would be pretty similar to this year? Or that is going to be higher or lower?","Ryan Lance","I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the range of where we\u2019re at this year.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Jeff, on the corporate expense do you have a guidance that for 2013, 2014, what type of run rate that normal quarter may look like?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, maybe just a couple words about our corporate segment. So with the spine and the way we realigned our segments some of those things that didn\u2019t used to be in corporate are in corporate now, particularly some of the technology operations, so that\u2019s going to introduce a little bit of volatility to corporate numbers. When you think about kind of core corporate, which is made up primarily of net interest expense and kind of corporate G&A, that\u2019s going to be around I would say $220 million a quarter more or less, but there\u2019s going to be probably more volatility in the corporate number than you might have been used to seeing in the past.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Jeff, that\u2019s an after-tax number, right?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, that\u2019s an after-tax income number. Right, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And, Matt, I\u2019m just curious. Is there any core key difference between your consolidate bitumen output and your equity of (inaudible) bitumen output? So in other words, when we\u2019re looking at estimating the pricing, the implied bitumen pricing, is there any core key differences that we should assume that there would be differences?","Matt Fox","Well, basically you can think of three different areas. Some ore produces a synbit, so the bitumen is blended with the synthetic. The FCCL assets both blend with the condensate. So as condensate prices and synthetic prices move around that affects the net (inaudible). Within the FCCL, Christina Lake has a higher TAN content Foster Creek. so as a result it sees a bit of a discount to the blend it sells. But roughly speaking at current prices the net mark at Surmont and Foster Creek are about the same, and the net mark at Christina Lake is a bit less because of this high TAN content.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Matt, have you guys received a final approval to restart fully on Peng Lai from the Chinese?","Matt Fox","We have submitted an EIA application and overall development plan, revised the overall development plan. We expect the approval shortly from both of those.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Thank you. A final on. Jeff, on the inventory standpoint at the end of the third quarter, are you guys still under it, over it? Or should we assume pretty much that you catch up by now?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, when you have an operation the size of ours, and you\u2019ve got a lot of liftings happening, oil liftings happening in places like Europe and Alaska and in Asia, every quarter you\u2019re going to have a little bit of fluctuation between the amount that you sell and the amount that you produce and it\u2019s going to go plus and minus. I mean generally we\u2019re in a balanced position, but we talked in the first quarter that we had about an $80 million negative impact from timing. We\u2019ve come out this quarter we said about an $80 million positive impact from timing. We\u2019re likely to see that order of magnitude. Types of swings can happen just because \u2013 through normal operations of timing of when...","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Sure. Fully understand that. From an inventory standpoint your are pretty balanced at end of the third quarter?","Jeff Sheets","Right. Again, we\u2019ll have pluses and minuses. Particularly when you look at particular segments you can have pluses and minuses just as part of your normal operations.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Very good. Thank you.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","Hey, guys. I want to go back to one of the earlier questions about the dividend. Your long-term growth target of 3% to 5% and your simultaneous target of having one of the highest dividends in the industry, if you discover that both cannot be done at the same time, which do you choose?","Ryan Lance","Well, we set our priority on our funding is with the dividend.","Pavel Molchanov","So I guess what\u2019s the minimum acceptable level for organic growth? In other words, would be willing to take that down to 2% to 4%? 1% to 3%? Or is the dividend unambiguously what you would choose regardless?","Ryan Lance","We would like to be here in 10 years saying we\u2019ve had steady dividend raises every year over an extended period of time. How fast we grow the dividend is going to be a function of how fast cash flows actually grow. We sit today at one of the higher dividends, and we\u2019ve had some very strong dividend growth over the past decade. I think what we\u2019re saying is we expect to have dividend growth going forward. It won\u2019t be at the same pace that has been the past, but that\u2019s a key part of our delivering to the shareholders. And we really can\u2019t sit here today and tell you exactly what the dividend growth rate is going to be going forward. It\u2019s an important part of what we offer the shareholders.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. I appreciate, guys.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the time that we have a question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Ellen DeSanctis for closing remarks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, Kim, and thank you, everybody. If there were folks in the queue that we didn\u2019t get to, Ryan and I are obviously more than happy to cover up the questions off line. Thank you very much for your interest, and we look forward to ongoing communications in December and certainly in the early part of the year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine and welcome everybody. Our executive speakers for today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our Executive Vice President and CFO and Matt Fox, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production. They will make some prepared remarks and then of course, will take your questions. ","We will have folks to stick a question and one follow up today just so we can move through the queue. A couple of quick reminders. Today\u2019s materials are available on our website and we will post the transcript of this call there soon. ","I also wanted to remind you we\u2019ve previously announced that we will host our 2014 analyst meeting in New York on April 10. So look out for some additional logistical details on that. And then finally, our safe harbor statement is shown on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation that we will make some forward looking statements during today\u2019s website. The statement as well as our periodic filings with the SEC outline some of the uncertainties and risks in our future performance.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Ellen and hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. So we just finished our first full year of an independent E&P company and all of us here at ConocoPhillips are pretty proud of what we have accomplished. 2013 was a year in which we had to achieve several strategic and operational goals to position the company for 3% to 5% volume and margin growth in 2014 and beyond. And that\u2019s what we did.","So if you turn to Slide 3, let me describe some of the highlights from this important year. Operationally, we met our production goals for the year. As importantly, we grew our reserves to fuel our future growth. As we saw it in announcement today, we achieved 179% reserve replacement ratio and grew reserves about 3%. Pretty strong results for a company of our size and certainly speaks to the quality of our asset base and our investment programs.","Our 3% to 5% growth will come from major projects and development drilling programs across our operations. In 2013, we achieved start-ups in several major projects and we continued to ramp up our unconventional programs in the Lower 48. These activities will ramp up during 2014 as well and also provide strong momentum into 2015. ","In looking longer term, our exploration program, which is key for sustaining our future growth, we had another successful year in 2013. We announced three Deepwater Gulf of Mexico successes. We advanced our North American unconventional exploration programs and accessed additional opportunities around the growth goal. So operationally, we hit the milestones we set for ourselves in 2013 and we have positioned the company for growth. ","2013 was also a strong financial year. On a full year adjusted earnings, we were at $7.1 billion, up 5% compared to 2012\u2019s adjusted earnings. This translates to $5.70 per share for the year. Cash from operations grew year over year and we ended up 2013 with $6.5 billion of cash and short term investments on the balance sheet. ","Our cash margins grew 11% compared to 2012 and this reflects the fundamental shift toward liquids in our portfolio and certainly a key aspect of our value proposition. Strategically it was an active year for ConocoPhillips as well. We closed over $10 billion of non-core asset dispositions, including Kashagan and Algeria and these are certainly important steps toward high-grading our portfolio and Nigeria is really the only remaining announced asset sale to complete we hope to have that done relatively soon. ","During \u201913, we maintained our commitment t to pay a compelling dividend. We increased our dividend by about 4.5% at midyear and remained committed to increases overtime.","So in summary, \u201813 was a very successful year for the company operationally, financially and strategically. We accomplished what we set out to do, to high-grade our portfolio, to position ourselves for volume and margin growth, to access and build opportunities for future growth, maintain our financial strength and finally, deliver strong shareholder return.","So let me now turn over the call to Jeff and Matt for some additional comments on 2013 and a look into 2014.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks, Ryan. Well, first to recap the fourth quarter results on slide four. Fourth quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $1.74 billion or $1.40 a share. Adjusted earnings were essentially flat to last year\u2019s fourth and down slightly sequentially despite lower realizations.","Some of the drivers in this quarter\u2019s performance aren\u2019t obvious, so I have the detail on those items. Embedded in this quarter earnings are weaker liquids realization in North America, reflecting wide differentials to WTI and WCS.","For example, in our Lower 48 segment, our realized price for crude oil averaged 90% of WTI in Q4 2013, compared to 101% of WTI in Q4 2012. Bitumen prices were also particularly weak this quarter.","Volumes for the quarter were negatively impacted by unusual weather in the Lower 48 and the North Sea which we pre-announced. We also had continued curtailment in Libya and a plan to turnaround in Qatar.","And finally, the quarter benefited from lower tax expenses. Our tax expenses were lower both because of increased proportion of production in areas more favorable fiscal term, as well as an approximately $100 million benefit related to changes in tax estimates from several regions and an $85 million tax benefit related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar.","Our fourth quarter segment earnings are shown in the lower right hand side of this chart. We have provided additional details on our operating and corporate segments in the backup materials.","Next I will cover full year 2013 financials on slide five. As Ryan mentioned, full year 2013 adjusted earnings were $7.1 billion or $5.70 a share and adjusted earnings were up about 5% from the full year of 2012.","And this makes the point that underlying performance is improving, realizations are about flat but margins are growing due to increases in liquids production -- liquids production from places of better fiscals which was consistent with our strategy.","Despite volatile pricing and basis differentials throughout the year all of our significant operating segments were profitable. We continue to believe that our diversified product and geographic splits are key to providing consistent performance overtime. That was a quick review of our reported earnings results, again there is additional information in our backup and supplemental materials.","Now I\u2019ll turn to slide six for some specific comment on production. Total production in the fourth quarter 2013 was 1.518 million BOE per day, which included 1.473 million BOE per day from continuing ops and 45,000 per day from discontinued operations. This chart shows the drivers of the change in production from continuing operations compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Fourth quarter of 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.566 million BOE per day, adjusting for dispositions in Libya, which were 10,000 and 43,000 BOE per day, respectively. Normalized production from continuing operations was 1.513 million BOE per day in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and that\u2019s the middle blue bar on the chart.","Moving to the right, we show the variance in downtime this quarter driven by unusual weather impacts and a month long turnaround in Qatar. Finally, you will see that growth just about offset decline.","I should note that there wasn\u2019t much of a contribution from major project startups since they came on late in the quarter, but they will start making a visible difference in our future production. The majority of our growth came from our development and major projects in the Lower 48 shale plays and the oil sands in Asia.","The full year volume story is more telling, so please turn to page seven. This chart shows the same convention of the previous chart, adjusted for downtime Libya and dispositions we grew product about 2%. Growth of 207,000 BOE per day was 30,000 per day higher than decline of 177,000 per day. This reflects underlying production growth in the Lower 48, the Oil Sands, Indonesia. Again the contribution from our recent major projects was negligible given the late year timing. And one note in 2013, Libya contributed 30,000 boe per day of production and at those volumes 2014 total production was 1.472 million boe per day. And we intend to exclude Libya in our future production outlook.","So we now think of this 1.472 million boe per day as the base on which we are going to grow 3% to 5% in 2014 and beyond. And that growth is bringing stronger margins, and Slide 8, 9 put our growth in margin trends in perspective. The chart on Page 8 shows the 30,000 barrel a day production change from the previous slide \u2013 sliced by segment and product in order of year-over-year change. ","At the top of the chart is our growth from liquids focused assets, especially the Lower 48 unconventionals, the oil sands in Canada and higher margin production from the Asia Pacific segment. We are growing in the places and in the products that have higher margins and declining in some of the lower margin streams like North America natural gas. ","During 2013, liquids production from continuing operations increased to 56% of total production and should continue to improve in 2014 and beyond. The impact of this mix shift on cash margins can be seen on Slide 9. This slows year-over-year cash margins both on a reported basis on the left side of the chart and price normalized basis on the right side of the chart.","As you can see from the left chart, 2013 cash margins grew 11% on an absolute basis despite flat realized prices compared to 2012, just like in the impact of production mix and location. On the right side of the page, we priced normalize the margins with 2012 as the baseline and margins grew 9% on this basis. We provided a reconciliation of this chart in our backup materials. We expect this metric to continue to improve and we will continue to track it since it\u2019s a key aspect of our value proposition. ","I will conclude my prepared remarks with our cash flow waterfall, which is another good story. So if you turn to Slide 10, this shows our cash flow performance for 2013. We began the year with about $4.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. For the year we generated about $16 billion of cash from operations and over $10 billion from asset sales.","Our continuing operations capital program was about $16 billion. We paid about $3.3 billion in dividends. As we announced in December, we prepaid $2.8 billion of future obligations to our 50% owned joint venture interest at FCCL and the remaining cash flow items such as debt repayments and cash flow associated with discontinued operations were a $1.5 billion use of cash. This leaves us in a very strong financial position at the end of the 2013 with about $6.5 billion of cash and short term investments on hand and a positive outlook for margin improvement that can grow cash from operations. So as we start 2014, we are well positioned to execute on our investment programs for the company. ","That concludes [inaudible] \u2026 on Slide 11.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. I will kick off the operation section with some comments on our 2013 reserve replacement performance. We achieved very strong results for the year. We ended 2013 with 8.9 billion boe of reserves, up 3% compared to last year. ","Importantly, we added over 1 billion barrels of reserves organically, resulting in our organic reserve replacement ratio of 179%. Including last year, we averaged over 165% organic reserve replacement as an independent E&P company. Our all-in reserve replacement ratio was 147%. This takes into account the impact of dispositions completed during the year primarily at Kashagan, Algeria and Cedar Creek Anticline which produces [ph] 588 million boe.","Some of the key additions came from the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Most of the additions in these two plays were a result of higher competence in performance and offset bookings [ph]. However we have only booked less than 30% of identified resource in Eagle Ford and Bakken and that\u2019s based on our current well pacings at 80 acres in the Eagle Ford and 320 acres on the Bakken. ","So those subside potential still exists in these place as we get results from a spacing pilots.","Canada contributed about a quarter of the additions predominantly from the oil sands. We also added reserves to APLNGs. We continue to drill our acreage there and with some contributions from both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.","We\u2019ll provide more details on our reserve bookings including costs incurred in our 10-K that will be filed in February. Again we are really pleased with these results and we believe the differential for a company of our size. And the bottomline is that these reserve additions give us confidence in our ability to deliver sustained growth and value accretion from our capital programs.","So next I will review our operating segments. In each segment, I will address key results from the fourth quarter and overall highlights from 2013 and I will give you some color around the activities to watch out for this year.","I\u2019ll start with the Alaska segment on Page 12, starting from the lower left with highlights from the fourth quarter. We applied for a two-year export license for our Kenai LNG plant. You may remember we base this facility in cold storage about a year ago to retain the option to restart but conditions changed with increase in gas production that could -- that cannot take advantage of that LNG capacity. At CD5, we began critical ice road constructions that lead us to new materials for roads and bridges, a key to accessing and preparing this project site.","Moving to the top right. 2013 was a big year for our Alaska business, probably the most significant highlight was the passage of SB21 of the More Alaska Production Act. These changes have made the investment climate in Alaska more attractive and as a result, we\u2019ll execute much higher budget for 2014, $600 million more than in 2013.","And this capital increase is focused on adding production. For example, in addition to CD5, we continue our major project, work at Drill Site 2S and Greater Moose\u2019s Tooth. And these three projects alone could add over 40,000 barrels a day growth by 2018 to offset the claims through tax.","And we continue to make progress on the Alaska LNG project. This month we executed the heads of agreement with ExxonMobil, BP, TransCanada and the State of Alaska that defines a path forward for the commencement of precede and if all goes well, precede what at the start of early in the second quarter of this year. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re making progress in all fronts in Alaska.","Let\u2019s move onto Slide 13 to cover the Lower 48 segment. As Jeff already mentioned, like many other operators, we had adverse production impact due to weather in the fourth quarter in this segment. But despite the weather, we achieved some significant progress in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken in particular.","In Eagle Ford, their operated program reached a milestone of more than 500 total wells on line. Production average 126,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter, representing 42% growth versus the same period previous year. And we reached a peak rate of 141,000 BOE a day in late December.","In the Bakken, we achieved a peak rate of 43,000 barrels a day and average 39,000 for the fourth quarter and that\u2019s a 63% increase compared to the same period last year. In the fourth quarter, we also made progress in our emerging deepwater business. We announced the discovery at Gila, conducted appraisal activities at Tiber and Coronado and continue the exploration drilling at Deep Nansen in the Western Gulf of Mexico.","Moving to the full year highlights, Lower 48 production was up 34,000 BOE per day representing 7% growth versus 2012. But more importantly behind this overall growth, our oil production grew 24% year-on-year delivering the mix shift we\u2019re targeting as we execute our strategy. In fact for the full year 2013, the Eagle Ford and Bakken grew 60% on a combined basis compared to 2012.","During 2013, we also matured our appraisal programs in the Delaware and Midland basins and the Niobrara. We continue to test various horizons, completion designs on natural wins in these plays with encouraging results to date. We\u2019ll give you an update on what we\u2019re learning in our Analyst Day in April.","So the goal of these appraisal programs is they have clearer view of development plans for these plays by the end of this year. And we are managing Gulf of Mexico deepwater program, we announced significant results at Shenandoah and Coronado in the first quarter and the discovery at Gila in the fourth quarter. These were important milestones and established strong momentum for acceleration in appraisal activities for 2014 and beyond. Our Lower 48 business is a very unique and high value segment. We have few leading positions in several of the best Lower 48 unconventional plays where we are growing production and continuing to identify upside. Also, we have an enviable position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that\u2019s delivered early success and provides future growth and significant value for the company.","Please go to Slide 14 and we will talk about the Canada segment. Operationally, our Canada business performed very well in the fourth quarter. Volumes continued to ramp up at Christina Lake Phase E and the Western Canada winter drilling program got underway. We were focused on drilling a liquids rich inventory. We continue to drill and evaluate on conventional appraisal and driven in Monterey and we spudded the first horizontal well in the channel play \u2013 we drilled two horizontal wells this season.","And overall 2013 was a very important year for the segment, like the Lower 48, we advanced very substantial yet divested of opportunities. For the year, production was up 1% and we achieved a 13% increase in liquids production compared to 2012 mostly from the oil sands. And oil sands business performed extremely well. Operational volumes grew 17% and by year end the Surmont 2 had achieved over 60% completion. And this positions us very well for \u201915 [ph], next 2015 as we plan. ","The theme for 2014 in Canada is continuous investment in growth. Our conventional liquids rich plays \u2013 our unconventional plays and our oil sands assets will all be active with some significant milestones on the horizon. So let\u2019s move on to our Europe segment on Slide 15.","Like the Lower 48, this segment experienced some very challenging, weather impacted fourth quarter production. However the big news on the fourth quarter was the start of production Ekofisk South in Norway and Jasmine in the UK. Ekofisk South production started in late October from the first of four pre-drilled wells, three months ahead of schedule. Ekofisk South is designed for 35 production wells that will grow production as we build over the next five years. ","At Jasmine first production was achieved in November. Production is currently constrained by the half of platform capacity until we fill the connection with J-Area [ph] platform which should occur during this quarter. ","Clearly the major projects dominated the operational themes for 2013 but extensive [indiscernible] in large part, project startups were key activity in the middle of the year and were executed very well. In addition to the two major projects I just discussed, work advanced on additional projects at Eldfisk 2, Britannia Long-Term Compression and Clair Ridge. We enter 2014 focused on ramping up and optimizing our major projects at Ekofisk South and Jasmine, and establishing production through our new East Irish Sea asset plant.","In addition, the Britannia long-term compression project is preparing for startup in the third quarter of this year, and pre-drilling is underway at Eldfisk 2 in anticipation of startup in early 2015. On exploration front, in this segment, we expect to see results from our unconventional appraisal in Poland; two verticals wells and one horizontal well are planned. We've also begun exploratory drilling in the Barents Sea.","So, our Europe segment had a pivotal year in 2013 after several years in project mode. We're positioned for growth from high value production that will extend the life of our legacy positions in Europe.","We have a lot of work to do to ramp up and optimize our operations in 2014, but these positions \u2013 these activities will position us for a strong future in that segment.","Finally, I'll cover our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment on Slide 16. Key fourth quarter highlights in this segment included the completion of the QG3 plant planned turnaround in Qatar and continued progress and access on future exploration options. We obtained operatorship and 100% working interest in the Palangkaraya PSC in Indonesia and we completed our seismic work in the Qijiang Block of China. These are both examples of relatively low cost, early stage exploration options. I'm pleased with the potential for materiality.","Highlights for all of 2013 included progress on major projects that will make a step-function contribution to future production levels in this segment. During 2013, our partners progressed towards major project start-ups in Malaysia. We are now anticipating a first quarter start-up at Siakap North-Petai and a second quarter start-up at Gumusut.","Our APLNG project is on schedule for first LNG by mid-2015, the Niobrara project stands at about 60% complete. On the exploration front, we announced the Proteus gas discovery in the Browse Basin, which was an untested structure to the Southeast of the Poseidon discovery.","The big catalyst for 2014 of the Malaysian start-ups at SNP, (inaudible) and Kebabangan. And we have an important year ahead at APLNG, as we approach start-up in 2015 and we expect to provide a full update of these projects at our April Analyst Meeting in New York.","Our appraisal programs offshore Australia will continue in 2014 with two wells each, plans in the Poseidon area and the Caldita\/Barossa and the punch line in this segment is very straightforward. Significant production ramp up over the next couple of years from high margin volumes and upside from a drilling exploration condensate.","I don\u2019t have a slide in our other international segment. The main focus last year was on executing the divestitures that Ryan mentioned. In 2014, the key segment activity will be of exploration in Senegal and Angola, which should get underway by midyear.","I will conclude my prepared remarks with some comments on our production outlook for the first quarter. We are on track to deliver 3% to 5% growth in 2014 from the projects and activities I just described. Excluding Libya, we expect to achieve approximately 1.5 million barrels a day this year.","As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019ll exclude Libya from future production outlook since we are not optimistic that production will resume from the eastern field anytime soon. In the first quarter, we estimate the volumes from continued operations excluding Libya could range from 14.90 to 15.30 and those in BOE per day. This range reflects short-term uncertainty around the ramp up of recent and pending start-ups, and includes a 15,000 barrel a day impact from a turnaround of the second chain in Qatar that will occur in March.","Now, I will turn the call back to Ryan for a brief recap and summary of the key things for 2014 on slide 17.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Matt. So, I hope there is no doubt that 2013 was a successful year for the company. We delivered on our commitments but perhaps more importantly, we positioned the company for a strong 2014.","Operationally, we had a significant inflection point for the company. We expect to continue ramping up our unconventional drilling programs and progressing on our major growth project. And as Matt mentioned, we expect to grow on almost all of our business segments this year, while progressing the major projects that will continue our growth into 2015 and beyond.","Meanwhile, it\u2019s a big year for our exploration programs. In our conventional program, we will be drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Senegal, the Barents Sea in Australia. In our unconventional program, it was an active year in the Lower 48 Permian, the Niobrara plays as well as Poland and Canada.","We should see ongoing improvement in underlying margins as we bring on new volumes and we will maintain our focus on improving returns while staying committed to returning capital to our shareholders.","On the strategic front, we are moving beyond the positioning phase of our journey as an independent E&P company. So now we are focused on executing our current plans to deliver growth in volumes, in margins, while positioning the company for long-term success.","Our goal here is to have a deep inventory of choices and options for investment and to be the best capital allocators in the business. We think our diversified approach to this business will service well over the long-term. We are not dependent on any single product, play type or geography and this allows us to consistently execute our programs through the cycles.","Bottom line, we are positioned to deliver 3% to 5% growth in both production and margins with a compelling dividend. That\u2019s our value proposition that we set out and we are committed to delivering on it.","So, I hope, Jeff, Matt and I have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones in 2014. It should be exciting year and I look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Meeting in April in New York. And I would mention -- I think Matt mentioned 2014 production of 1.55 million BOE per day.","So, now let me take all your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","In Lower 48 and also in International E&P, cash margin seemed to have been significantly stronger versus the year ago period, despite the [indiscernible] from realization, which I think one of Jeff's slide indicated. On this point, I want to see if we could get some color on the improved performance in those two areas, and specifically where you are seeing the improvement regionally in both Lower 48 and International E&P?","Jeff Sheets ","Doug, I think it primarily comes back to changes in mix, when you look at cash margins within that segment, and that's what we are trying to highlight with the slide. It just kind of shows year-over-year changes in production. You just saw a fairly large shift in liquids production that we talked about increases in very significant percentage related primarily to Eagle Ford and the Bakken, the biggest driver of that change.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","And Internationally, Jeff, could it be the loss of some lower margin production as well?","Jeff Sheets ","Yes, I think that's the overall mix. As you would have properly flagged there Doug, if you look year-over-year we basically had the same overall realized price. But the shift of production within different jurisdictions, which is kind of highlighted on that one slide we have, shows production going up in the Lower 48, up in Canada, up in Asia, down in Alaska, down in Norway, down in the U.K. So, up in kind of lower tax areas and down in higher tax areas. That has a lot to do with helping drive the cash margin \u2013 that and just the shift overall to liquids production over gas production.","Ryan Lance ","Doug, that's what we said. That's going to continue because that's the direction, that's the strategy, that's how we're allocating our capital, and that's how we're thinking about how we grow the margins and grow our cash flows as the production grows.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","And then just quickly on capital expenditures. I think Slide 10 indicated that the company prepaid almost $3 billion of its oil sands commitment. And so I want to see if you could spend a minute on that item specifically why the company chose to do so? Was not there any interest or tax benefits that were meaningful, and also how it affects the spending profile on that project going forward?","Jeff Sheets ","As we mentioned we prepaid a $2.8 billion obligation that we had and that was something that we incurred when we set up the joint venture back many years ago. The key for us is that was an interest-bearing obligation, it had about a 5% interest on it. You can really think of that being equivalent to debt. It was an obligation that we needed to pay over the next several years, and when we had as much cash as we have on our balance sheet just from a balance sheet management point of view that makes sense to prepay that obligation and save the 5% interest as opposed to leaving that cash on your balance sheet and variable return on the cash. ","But the other thing we want to make sure we point out on that is cash that's moving into a 50% joint venture. So while it's a $2.8 billion outflow for us, that means that we essentially still own about half of that $2.8 billion. So it's more of a $1.4 billion net of outflow. So that does reduce capital that we'll have in the subsequent years. We did that primarily just from kind of a balance sheet management point of view of getting rid of an interest-bearing obligation and taking advantage of the fact that you would otherwise have cash on your balance sheet, not making a very good return.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Just thinking about one of the components of that is obviously your shale portfolio and you gave good guidance back at the investor day last year. Still some growth in the Eagle Ford where you seem to be a bit ahead of plan in the Bakken and Permian, then accelerate. So what's the constraints on perhaps even driving a little bit harder in terms of shale? Is it the amount of money that you have to still spend on some of these longer life pancake type assets, , SAGD, APLNG or is it that the shale itself has not yet delineated enough for you to put more capital to work?","Matt Fox ","Well, Ed, this is Matt. It's really neither of those things actually, really what is the -- we\u2019re focused just now on running a safe and efficient operation. We do want this economy to scale, we do want to get too far ahead of infrastructure. But the real reason is that that we\u2019re benefiting from -- still benefiting from our cost learning curve and are drilling in the completions and that\u2019s going to improve even further as we move towards spud drilling for most of our wells.","So the cost learning curve and then there\u2019s a huge technology learning curve ahead of us in the unconventionals. This going to improve the overall efficiency of these developments and -- in the years to come. So we see consistent redeem in the Eagle Ford with an 11 rig program and we do have the flexibility as you point out to change that everything that\u2019s a right value proposition.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right. And most of the rigs which is HPP so there\u2019s no pressure as well. And then just a follow-up on shale and Matt, what are you most excited about that you feel that you can talk about last year when you think about the North American shale, clearly not just and maybe include Colombia as well but not just in the U.S.?","Matt Fox","Sure. I mean, I think, we\u2019re making progress on all of the shale plays, clearly the Eagle Ford and Bakken are now in development mode, but we\u2019re still seeing upside there and associated with pilot test that we\u2019re running for looking at decrease in well space and I sort of alluded to that in my prepared remarks. And we\u2019re getting encouraging results in the Permian, both in the Delaware and the Midland Basin and encouraging results in the Niobrara.","And then, again, in Canada we have -- we\u2019re still getting good results from our unconventional program out there. And we\u2019re going to give you a lot more detail on this when we get to the Analyst Meeting in April, because we think we will give you sort of update on what we\u2019re learning in all these plays and that I\u2019ll take a bit of time and we\u2019ll do that in April.","Ryan Lance","I would add Ed that, we continue to believe and I think our results are proving out that we\u2019re in best positions in the best plays and can we get any surprises we get usually to the upside and we\u2019ve got more resource and more opportunity as we think about our capital program and our allocation of capital is -- some of the big projects starting to wind down.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Great. Very helpful. Very clear. Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jim Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Ryan Lance","Good afternoon, Jim.","Jim Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Just wanted to look a little bit ahead on this margin story, obviously the passage of SB21, the last production act as you guys thinking a little bit differently about Alaska. And we obviously appreciate the details on Moose\u2019s Tooth and so forth. And I -- with the reservation that I\u2019m sure you guys are working on -- I want to talk about this in more detail at the analyst day. But you guys just comment a bit on how you see that affecting the margin profile going forward. I mean, obviously, you have an array of tax benefits in that bill. And so just, can you, sort of how to -- how it compares to the base production and is it kind of along the lines of Lower 48 or how should we think of that?","Ryan Lance","Well, it\u2019s not as strong the Lower 48 because there\u2019s still even with the tax improvements in Alaska, higher taxation in Alaska than in the Lower 48. The Alaska production is all oil. Which helps us on the cash margin side as well, where you think about something like Eagle Ford is kind of 60 oil and 20 NGLs and 20 natural gas.","So Alaska is going to also contribute to helping with cash margin because the continues to help with the oil production, probably not as much as increased Lower 48 production wells.","Jim Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay. Great. That\u2019s all I had.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Ryan Lance","Hi, Paul.","Jeff Sheets","Good afternoon, Paul","Ellen DeSanctis","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I have two questions, one maybe is a little bit overall picture, Ryan, one of your competitors Shell the new CEO is essentially saying that had it been a hunch, it\u2019s risky and want to scale back. Obviously that for the company and from your side you can\u2019t just always go for the single, it won\u2019t work? So that\u2019s basically that you have what internally considered by the proper allocation of capital, how much is your percent of your capital, you want to chase those really high-risk big (inaudible) or that how much is that you for that\u2019s a lower risk and smaller one? And also that whether it\u2019s capital or production profile I mean is there anything you can share on that thinking?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. What I\u2019d say Paul is that we\u2019re broadly at the higher level in terms of allocation. We think about spending about 15% of our capital on the exploration. We like to do that through the cycles. Now if we get success and we start to appraise, we\u2019ve got a decision that we face about increasing that percentage for appraisal and keeping an exploration program going.","But I\u2019d say, broadly speaking, we\u2019re spending about 15% of our capital on exploration. We\u2019re really kind of value based as we think about it. I don\u2019t go into it trying to overload either unconventional or conventional. Today our program is pretty balanced. It\u2019s about 50-50 conventional and unconventional.","But everything has to compete. So whether it\u2019s a new unconventional play that we might be looking at in other country or here in the U.S. or in North America, it\u2019s got to compete on a cost to supply basis and an expected rate of return. So for doing our risking appropriately, doing our technical work appropriately everything has got to play.","So I don\u2019t really look at it and say, I\u2019m not going to go elephant hunting or anything like that, we\u2019re just trying to do the best technical work we can, risk it the best way we can and then every dollar competes. So we\u2019re not\u2026","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I guess, I mean Ryan, if I could clarify myself. When I say elephant hunting, it\u2019s not just for the exploration. So for example when you go with Alaskan LNG, if indeed that the project trying not to be economically viable is going to be extremely expensive? And even the partner that your share is going to be huge. So there is huge big block and if anything happened there, it is going to be a huge negative impact on the company. So, those are kind of projects. So I\u2019m wondering that if they internally sell off my -- a percentage of the capital or the production you want to be in those big projects?","Ryan Lance","I think we look at -- we still look at returns and cost of supply and try to ask ourselves is it competitive in the portfolio. We know that big resource, long-dated projects like Alaska LNG that you referred to are similar to what we\u2019re executing in Queensland or what we\u2019re doing in the oil sands of Canada. Both have a different profile, different return profile than unconventionals in North America but again this is the part where we think a diversified large global E&P company with the balance sheet like we have is important because there is a place in the portfolio for some of those projects to balance it out.","Over time they reduce capital intensity and they have a place in the portfolio. But we have to be careful. We have to look at the other alternative investments and the other options and choices we have in the portfolio. And we haven\u2019t made that decision on the Alaska gas because we\u2019re still studying it and we\u2019re still trying to understand what that cost is going to look like, what the economics, how it competes in the global marketplace for LNG and how it competes in our portfolio.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And the second question is for Matt. Matt, on Eagle Ford, based on your previous production chart from this point on that growth is really going to slow down. But I guess my question is, is that just being out of conservative or indeed you think that is the most likely base case scenario. Should we be more aggressively trying to shift and increase the activity in either Bakken or in the Permian?","Matt Fox","Yeah. So we\u2019re going to give you an update on that Paul, as we may get together in the April for the Analyst Day. That was a view of how production would be likely to move in the Eagle Ford. Our view has been changed. We were going to show you something that\u2019s a bit more optimistic than that in April.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Folks, good afternoon. I\u2019m sorry to ask you to repeat the guidance. But I just wanted to make sure, be a 100% clear. I thought I heard the first quarter guidance number and then a full year. And I was hoping you could just repeat that if you don\u2019t mind?","Matt Fox","The first quarter guidance Blake was 1,490,000 to 1,530,000 barrels a day for the first quarter and that\u2019s really -- there is quite a wide range of uncertainty there because of the ramp-up of new projects that are going to be happening in that quarter. And this also would be affected by the downtime and the one of the Qatar LNG trends. So that was that the first quarter.","And our full year guidance is basically unchanged from what we\u2019ve been seeing at 1.55 million barrels a day for the year. And all of those numbers I just gave you exclude Libya.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. Matt, just to be clear. Now you had some weather-related impacts on Lower 48 in 4Q, obviously we\u2019ve seen some pretty rough weather this past week. Does that contemplate anything you may be witnessing currently for 1Q?","Matt Fox","That range includes some uncertainty and any weather impacts that we\u2019ll see for the remainder of the quarter.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay, great. The second question I had for you, this maybe a bit premature but on pre-salt Angola, I know you will begin drilling this year. Some of your peers who had success and ended up having some gas, basically the fiscal terms from what I understand didn\u2019t really contemplate monetizing gas. Are you trying to proactively get ahead of maybe kind of reevaluating your contracts with the government or you just taking a wait-and-see approach there?","Ryan Lance","We don\u2019t have gas right, within those two blocks, blocks 36 and 37. And the way that we model the petroleum system there, we don\u2019t expect to find gas, the way we model the maturity of the (inaudible) expectation is that we will find oil, if we find anything, it\u2019s still exploration in next program. So they -- we are still hopeful for that. We had blocks. It\u2019s a quite fix section above the structures and the effect of that is that it fills the [Soshok] which means the [Soshok] less material, not to get too technical on your business. But nonetheless we expect that that\u2019s going to be an orderly petroleum system prospect.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. Good to hear. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Blakse.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon everybody.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hey Doug.","Ryan Lance","Hey Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am not sure who wants to take this one but if you go to Slide 7 in your book. I am wondering if you could give us a little bit of help with its puts and takes on how you see 2014. So 1.55 , guidance, I\u2019m looking at last two bars of decline in the growth because what I\u2019m really trying to get to is the composition over the decline in terms of gas in particular, obviously that\u2019s when you look at your realized margin, I am guessing that would be a big help because there is a lot of gas in there. So if you could help me with the puts and takes and I got a follow-up?","Ellen DeSanctis","Doug, this is Ellen here. We love to take this kind of offline with you. We\u2019ve got the data that could help you but I don\u2019t have it at my finger tips. Obviously in the 177, quite a bit of -- our North American gas is declining of course and now we see in the 207, excuse me, the growth we show on that page, that our liquids ramped in the unconventional.","Ryan Lance","Doug, your question is probably more looking forward to 2014, right?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, yeah, its pretty much for 2014. I am trying to get a feel for the underlying decline on the mix and underlying decline.","Jeff Sheets","Yeah. I don\u2019t think that data we got really at our finger tip right now. Directionally we are going to see the same type of things. We are going to continuing to grow more liquids production than gas production as we ramp up oil production in Malaysia as we continue to grow the unconventional that the oil sands continue to grow. So you will see lot of the same things in 2014. We probably have to -- I am not sure if we tap that information , that\u2019s something we can probably give you more detail on\u2026","Ellen DeSanctis","Analyst Meeting here.","Jeff Sheets","\u2026when we do the Analyst Meeting. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, that\u2019s great. I will pick it offline. My follow up really is kind of related, I guess, but hopefully you can help me with this one Jeff, but if I look at the next several projects coming on line, it looks to us at least that that there is a fair number of them, we\u2019ll not incur cash taxes at least from the early years of production. I am just wondering if you could help offer some color and particularly things like basically you came in all feedstock, I\u2019m guessing, you won\u2019t be paying cash taxes in early years. I\u2019m just wondering if you could confirm that and may be press numbers around that. Thank you.","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, I may add a few things and will see that quite helps. So if you think about where our capitals going in the Lower 48, lot of it\u2019s going into drilling, lot of that capital is IDCs and which of course get very rapid depreciation. In Norway, you get rapid depreciation, in U.K. you get essentially almost immediate depreciation on new capital. So directionally you are right on all of those.","The way that manifests itself in kind of our results is just what you see under deferred tax line on the cash flow statement. You\u2019ve seen that that was a pretty significant source of positive cash in 2013, little bit less so in the fourth quarter than in the other quarters but there were some impacts that how the impairments in the fourth quarter roll through the cash flow statement, ebbs and flows impacts. You would have seen the similar number in the fourth quarter which you saw in the previous quarter. So it was a pretty substantial impact, positive to cash that will probably continue on in the 2014. But I don\u2019t have the number that I can give you that you know exactly what that impacts are going to be. But that\u2019s where it shows up for us, it\u2019s \u2013 how much of it add back to your deferred tax and new cash flow statement.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s embedded in your report cash margins, Jeff?","Jeff Sheets","No. It\u2019s not. The way we do a cash margin calculation is just simply a adjusted net income plus your amortizations, plus your DD&A and your dryhole cost and your leasehold amortization. So we don\u2019t factor in deferred tax into that. So, if we take rather kind of simplified approach to cash margins and we do that because that\u2019s the kind of metric we can have a comparison against other companies with.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Really helpful. Thanks guys.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug. Welcome back to you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate the guidance on margin growth and production growth. I was also wondering, whether you guys have sort of goals on return on capital employed and what those looks like underneath so the assumptions you have for 2014 and for that matter going forward?","Ryan Lance","So our return on capital employed for 2013 is pretty similar to what we saw in 2012 and it will be, will be a bit challenge to improve return on capital employed in a very near term. A lot of that has to do with the fact we got large capital going into projects that are not really producing much right now, if you think about APNLG, some of the oil sands assets and also due to the fact that, as Matt mentioned in his remarks, we were relatively conservatively booked on a lot of the unconventionals, which leads to some pretty high DD&A rates on the unconventionals and all those things kind of impact net income, which of course impacts return on capital employed.","You see a better picture for us once APLNG starts up, when the Surmont starts up and once we get a little bit more fully booked on the unconventional. So, we do see that we will be improving returns on capital employed plus prices can affect that metric as they change but those improvements are probably more in a 2016, 2017 kind of timeframe.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Fair enough. And just on Alaska, so I understand it\u2019s kind of early to figure out what the cost this project would be, but what type of capital are you spending right now on it and what are the -- what\u2019s sort of the critical sort of timelines or sort of time post in order for this to sort of move forward or even gain some traction?","Ryan Lance","I assume you\u2019re talking about APLNG?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Yeah.","Ryan Lance","Yeah. So as you know we\u2019ve selected the concept -- we\u2019ve selected to say. We just announced an [HOA] with the first structure in place for the project and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll start pre-FEED in the second quarter.","Right now, it looks like a project that will be somewhere between $45 billion and $65 billion, and that\u2019s because of some movement, different scope and so on, but that\u2019s our scale. And it will be something around the 17 million tons per annum since three chains there.","And the timeline that we\u2019re working with just now is that we would make a final investment decision in 2016 or 2017. There is quite a bit FEED required for project of this scale and between the pre-FEED and the FEED that will be 2016 or \u201817 before we make a final investment decision and first gas would be 2022 to 2025. So, that\u2019s the sort of range that we\u2019re thinking about just now for the project.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Ryan Lance","Okay. Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Hi. Good afternoon.","Ryan Lance","Hi, Roger.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hey, Roger.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Well, I guess, main thing I\u2019d like to focus on here is just trying to understand the, I know how you reiterated the 3% to 5% volume growth, 3% to 5% margin expansion. Could we walk through here what the margin expansion should be from at least my growth assumption more of second half \u201814 of that but just I wanted to hear what your take is on that?","Ryan Lance","I think that\u2019s probably a fair assumption. As Matt mentioned earlier, as we think about volumes overall for 2014, the impact of timing on start-ups at some of these key major projects is going to be a question.","I mean, we do -- I think like some of the previous questions that I have gotten too. The same kind of things that drove margin growth this year are going to be the things, the drivers next year as we continue to ramp up oil sands production ramp up, Lower 48 production and get to a full production in Gumusut, which because of the way the production recovery works there, had some really strong cash part and so you will see those all same, three drivers. North America natural gas probably won\u2019t grow in our portfolio going forward. We could see a slowing of decline in Alaska, but overall that\u2019s probably not going to cause margins to move significantly. So it\u2019s really back to the same primary drivers that we\u2019ve had this year, going to be drivers in 2014 as well.","Ryan Lance","With the same reductions in the gas side, so Europe, Lower 48, some of the lower margin gas, it\u2019s not getting capital investment, Roger, it starts to decline since that mix that Jeff described in his remarks.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. So it is safe to assume that margin is sort of a full year event in the production. Like, you said, I don\u2019t know want to put words in your mouth. But at least in my assumption on projects start-ups more of a second half event, does it get right away?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. And really with cash metric like that, we try to warn every quarter that that can swing up and down because incoming DD&A can be less than, I would say ratable through the year for different reasons. So we think it\u2019s important as we go forward that we talked about just kind of how we\u2019re progressing on more longer-term measures and just looking at it quarter-to-quarter.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. And well, I know you don\u2019t give quarterly production. The last question I had was last year, especially in the summer months, a lot of turnaround activity had a pretty significant impact on production volumes. Can you kind of characterize for us this year when we would be anticipating in terms of maintenance and turnarounds?","Matt Fox","","Yes. In 2014, we\u2019re expecting about 20% more planned downtimes than we have in 2013. And we\u2019ve got downtime I mentioned in the QG3 between seven in the first quarter. We have turnarounds in Prudhoe Bay in the second and third quarter, turnarounds in the U.K. in the second and third quarter. And a big turnaround to the Bayu-Undan field in Australia in the third quarter. So we are expecting the overall planned at 10 times to be above 20% more than it was in 2012.","Ryan Lance","2013.","Matt Fox","In 2013, sorry.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank, Roger. Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, Christine and thank you everybody. Of course, feel free to call us back.

My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","Clayton C. Reasor","Thank you, Kim. Well, good morning, and welcome to ConocoPhillips' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call, our final conference call as an integrated company. ","Today, we'll focus on key financial and operating results for the first quarter, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2012. I'm joined by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","As in the past, you can find our presentation material on the Investor Relations section of the ConocoPhillips website. And in addition, you can also find some presentation material that we've recently put out on each of the stand-alone companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. ","Please read the Safe Harbor statement on the bottom of this slide. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. ","So that said, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to take you through our first quarter results.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Thanks, Clayton. I'll start with some highlights for the first quarter. During the quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion. That's $2.02 a share. This is flat with the prior quarter and up from $1.82 per share in the first quarter of 2011. If you look back, in the first quarter of 2011, we had the same level of earnings that we did in the last quarter, but we saw a $0.20 per share improvement, and that reflects the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. ","Our annualized return on capital employed was 12%. We generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations. That's $3.23 a share. ","In E&P, our production was $1.64 million BOE per day, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. And if you compare that to the first quarter of 2011, our production per share increased by 9%. ","So we had seasonally strong refining utilization of 91% globally. And during the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Vietnam, and we funded $1.9 billion in share repurchases, and that brings the total of share repurchases since we started the program in 2010 to around $17 billion. And as of today, we're about a week away from the distribution of the Phillips 66 shares to our shareholders, and we're executing the remaining steps of this transaction this week and right on target to complete on the 1st of May. ","So let's turn to Slide 3 and look at our earnings in more detail. Reported earnings for the quarter were $2.9 billion. This includes gains on asset sales of $987 million, offset by $562 million of impairments and $95 million of repositioning costs. The gains were mostly related to the sale of Vietnam business, and the impairments were primarily related to the Mackenzie Gas Project and the associated leaseholds. ","Adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion were flat with the first quarter last year. But as I mentioned, they were 10% higher on a per share basis as a result of our share repurchase program. ","E&P adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion and R&M adjusted earnings were $444 million during the first quarter, and our other segments, together, provided an additional $32 million of earnings. But Chemicals had a record quarter, and we're going to provide more details about that later in the presentation. ","So next, we'll look at some more detail on our segment earnings, and we'll start with E&P production, which is on Slide 4. Our first quarter production was 1.64 million BOE per day. That's down 65,000 BOE per day from the first quarter last year. If you exclude the impacts of dispositions and the suspension of our operations at the Peng Lai Field in Bohai Bay, production would have been 9,000 BOE per day more than a year ago. ","Our growth opportunities are performing well, and we continue to execute on our plans to exploit the unconventional resources in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and oil sands. Our unconventional plays have contributed 85,000 BOE per day compared to a year ago. These growth opportunities are part of the 47,000 BOE increase shown on the slide. We also had less downtime and a slightly increased production from Libya, which improved production. And these improvements more than offset our normal field declines. ","The suspended operations at Peng Lai, combined with asset dispositions and the decline in our Russia and Naryanmarneftegaz production, reduced production by about 94,000 BOE per day. And on the natural gas side, compared to the first quarter of 2011, North American natural gas production was 18,000 BOE per day lower, with about half of that coming from curtailments. ","Now I'll turn to the E&P earnings on Slide 5. E&P results benefited from strong crude prices. However, the strength in crude prices was offset by weakness in North American natural gas markets, and as well as NGL prices and a widening spread between crude oil and bitumen prices. Our E&P adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.1 billion, slightly lower than the first quarter last year. ","As this Slide 5 illustrates $156 million of after-tax impact. We had that due to higher prices and other market factors, and that was offset by about $225 million decrease associated with lower volumes. ","In the U.S., earnings in the first quarter of 2012 were $158 million higher than a year ago. This reflects the improvement in domestic crude prices, but this was offset by significantly lower Henry Hub gas prices. Henry Hub averaged $2.72 this quarter, which is 34% lower than it was a year ago. ","Year-over-year, we saw reduced earnings in our international business. International was impacted this quarter by lower crude sales volumes and, again, significantly lower gas prices in Canada. ACO prices averaged $2.15 per million Btu this quarter, which is 44% lower than a year ago. ","So let's move to Slide 6, and I'll talk about some of our E&P unit metrics. As we just discussed on the previous slide, we saw strong crude prices, but this was offset by weakness in North American natural gas, NGL prices and the widening bitumen differentials. We produced around 110,000 barrels per day of NGLs in North America in the first quarter, and margins on this production were impacted by the fact that NGL prices did not move up as crude prices moved up. ","In addition, our first quarter results were adversely impacted by about $85 million after tax from differences between production and sales volumes and some other timing impacts. So year-over-year, these timing impacts and the weakness in natural gas and the relative weakness of NGLs and bitumen prices, along with some higher taxes, kept per barrel margins flat with the same quarter a year ago. ","So although we saw this disconnect between NGL and bitumen prices and crude prices in the recent quarter, this doesn't change our long-term view about our ability to grow cash margins as we shift capital towards higher margin production. As we've mentioned in our recent investor updates, we expect cash margins to grow 3% to 5% per year over the next 5 years in a flat price environment. So that completes our E&P segment results. ","Now let's take a look at our R&M segment results, which are on Slide 7. First quarter R&M adjusted earnings were -- of $444 million were $36 million less than the same period a year ago. And in comparing the periods, R&M earnings were negatively impacted, primarily by lower refining margins and some higher turnaround expenses. This was offset by higher earnings from volumes and improved marketing margins in the U.S. And we ran higher volumes at some of our Mid-Continent refineries where the margins were the strongest. ","So overall, despite improved market crack spreads, refining margins decreased, primarily due to less favorable crude differentials in Europe and the Gulf, East and West Coast regions and some lower secondary product margins. But turnaround expenses were $176 million pretax, and that's in line with our expectations. ","So we can move to the next slide and look at the R&M per barrel metrics. First quarter 2012 income per barrel was $1.80, and the cash contribution was $2.62. The per barrel metrics for R&M were similar to a year ago and up compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Compared to the fourth quarter of '11, R&M benefited from both a more favorable crude differentials and improved market crack spreads, which, together, drove significantly improved refining margins and higher adjusted earnings. ","So we continue to look for ways to improve our margins in this space through capturing more advantaged crudes and increasing clean product yield. Our clean product yield of 84% was flat with the prior quarter and 1% improved compared to the same period a year ago. Wood River drove about 40% of this improvement in the clean product yield post the core implementation in the fourth quarter 2011. ","Next, we'll take a look at some of the results from our other operating segments on Slide 9. Adjusted earnings increased in both our Chemicals and Midstream segments. Chemicals' earnings were $218 million during the quarter. This record quarter reflects a very strong margin environment. Industry margins for ethylene during the first quarter were among the highest recorded in 20 years. With domestic ethylene utilization rates north of 100%, CPChem was able to capture these margins. ","Compared to the first quarter of 2011, Chemicals' earnings improved by $25 million, due primarily to higher olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes, which were partially offset by lower margins in volumes and specialties, aromatics and styrenics. ","Midstream earnings of $93 million were more than 25% over a year ago, primarily due to higher gathering and processing volumes. In the first quarter of 2011, we had significant reductions due to severe weather, which we didn't see in the first quarter of 2012. ","Adjusted corporate expenses were $265 million for the first quarter of 2012. That's $39 million improved compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower net interest expense and benefit-related expenses. Excluded from these adjusted corporate expenses are about $95 million in repositioning costs. ","Let's go to Slide 10 and look at our cash flow for the first quarter. We generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations during the quarter and closed the sale of our Vietnam business unit, resulting in proceeds of a little over $1 billion. During the first quarter, we funded a $4.4 billion capital program. $4.2 billion of that was directed to E&P and around $200 million to R&M. And E&P capital for the quarter included over $500 million in exploration in Gulf of Mexico leaseholds. ","I want to explain an impact on our cash flow having to do with how we account for assets that we will be selling later in the year and that we've moved to a held-for-sale category during the second quarter. The impact of that is that in our -- when you look at the other line in our other cash -- in the cash flow from operation segment, you'll see a negative. And $450 million of this negative was reflected -- was as a result of moving assets to a held-for-sale category. This was offset by a $450 million positive that is in the working capital line. So were it not for these changes, you would have seen a working capital for the quarter that was negative by about that amount. ","If you look across all the segments, almost all the cash from operations -- really, all of the cash from operations this quarter came from our E&P operations. R&M cash from operations were consumed by working capital changes. In our Chemicals joint venture, the -- CPChem has begun retaining cash in order to fund a complete retirement of their debt balances later this year. We also paid $2.7 billion in shareholder distributions. That's split between the $1.9 billion of share repurchases and $843 million in dividends, and these share repurchases accounted for $25 million shares during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. And related to the repositioning, we issued $5.8 billion in senior notes at Phillips 66. These notes bear a weighted average pretax cost of 4.1%. Associated with this issuance, we are currently holding a restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion in addition to the $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. As part of the separation, the notes will transfer to Phillips 66, and ConocoPhillips will receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66 of approximately $6 billion. ","Turning to Slide 11, we'll talk about our capital structure. At the end of the first quarter, our equity balance was $67 billion, up $1 billion from year-end 2011. With income largely offsetting distributions, the equity increase is primarily related to foreign exchange impacts. Our debt balance increased reflecting the Phillips 66 debt I just discussed. And if you adjust that out, our debt to cap is 25% for the quarter. ","I'll move to Slide 12 and talk about some capital efficiency metrics. First quarter 2012 annualized returns on capital were 12%, which is flat from a year ago. If you break this down by segment, first quarter returns were 14 -- ROCEs were 14% in E&P, 9% in R&M, 50% in Midstream and 31% in Chemicals. This is a metric we're going to continue to focus on as we invest in higher margin assets across our portfolio, and they'll be a key initiatives for both companies going forward. ","So I will wrap up with some outlook comments and then we'll open the line for questions. ","So we're going to give guidance, first, for ConocoPhillips and then for Phillips 66. So starting with ConocoPhillips, our annual production guidance for 2012 remains unchanged at 1.55 million to 1.6 million BOE per day, and that depends on the timing of dispositions. Sequentially, in the second quarter, production will be down from the first quarter. Second quarter production will include turnaround and maintenance activity of 50,000 to 60,000 BOE per day, primarily in Australia, the U.K., Alaska and our Foster Creek, Christina Lake joint venture in Canada. And production in the second quarter will also be negatively impacted by 20,000 to 30,000 BOE per day related to dispositions, including the recent Vietnam disposal. In the Peng Lai Field in Bohai Bay, current gross production is 40,000 BOE per day and should continue at this level through the second quarter. ","We also expect continued gas shut-ins in North America of around 9,000 BOE per day due to low gas prices, and we continue to evaluate this for a further shut-in. And our full year capital guidance for the E&P is approximately $15 billion. ","So I'll shift now and talk about exploration. We expect exploration expenses to be in line with our previous guidance of $1.2 billion for the year, as we continue to progress our exploration portfolio in several core areas. ","In Australia, we indicated last quarter that we plan to commence a 5- to 7-well appraisal program around our Poseidon discovery. The Boreas 1 well spud on April 4, which is the first well in that appraisal drilling. In Angola, our seismic program has commenced and recent discoveries in the area confirmed the exploration potential. We expect drilling to start in 2013 or later. In Bangladesh, Blocks 10 and 11, we completed seismic activity in the first quarter this year, and we're analyzing the data. We have 1.4 million acres and 100% working interest in this opportunity. ","In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to spud an exploration well in the second or third quarter this year to test the Coronado prospect, and the operators at Shenandoah and Tiber are anticipating appraisal wells in 2012. ","In our international shale plays, we exercised the co-option for a 70% operating interest in a 5,000-acre position in the Western Baltic Basin of Poland. We have a co-option this year on the remaining 572,000-acre position. We drilled 2 horizontal wells and continue -- in 2011, and we will continue our pilot program in 2012. ","We plan to start up the first phase of our program in the frontier shale play in the Canning Basin in Australia, and we should commence 3 vertical wells in mid-2012. ","In North America, we've initiated 7 pilot programs in some of our new emerging plays in the Niobrara, Wolfcamp, Avalon, Canol and Duvernay plays. And we continue to pursue high-quality, liquids-rich unconventional opportunities globally. ","Now some updates on our major growth projects around the world. Efforts continue to drill our liquids-rich shale plays in North America in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian and the Cardium plays. At Eagle Ford, we expect to maintain a 16-rig average and drill about 180 wells in 2012. First quarter production averaged 54,000 BOE per day, and current production capacity is around 60,000. It will be our priority to stay ahead of condensate takeaway capacity to reduce any further curtailments. And system constraints are now primarily related to gas takeaway capacity in construction and some other infrastructure. ","In the Permian and Bakken, we are running a total of 13 rigs today, 5 more rigs than last -- this time last year. We expect to average 16 rigs during 2012. First quarter production at Permian and Bakken averaged 51,000 and 24,000 BOE per day, respectively. Our SAGD projects continue to grow production. As you've seen, bitumen production from SCCL increased 11,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of last year. And we're exploring further opportunities to achieve better netback pricing, such as improving the blend ratio, alternatives to synthetic and condensate distilluants [ph] and application of new technologies. ","We expect to sanction the second train of APLNG during the second quarter and are currently on track to deliver our first cargo in mid-2015. And we are in the Phase 1 development of the Jasmine projects in the U.K., and 2 of the 8 project wells were drilled. And so far, subsurface results are exceeding our expectations. Jasmine production should start in 2013. ","And finally, for ConocoPhillips, we are targeting $8 billion to $10 billion in asset dispositions over the next 12 months. We expect to repurchase 5 billion of shares in the first half of 2012, and the timing of additional share repurchases will depend on the timing of the dispositions. ","So now I'll turn and give some outlook on some items for Phillips 66 going forward. In R&M, we expect turnaround activity in the second quarter to be approximately $140 million pretax and global refining capacity utilization is anticipated to be in the low 90s. The majority of the turnaround activity is expected to be in our international operations next quarter. And we reiterate our full year guidance of around $450 million pretax for turnaround expenses. ","With the Wood River CORE project online, we're seeing a 5% increase in clean product yields at the refinery. And if you look at our WRB joint venture with Synovis, realized over $200 million gross profit uplift from the core project during the first quarter of 2012. ","Next, I'll turn to a discussion of some of the growth projects in the Phillips 66 Midstream and Chemicals businesses. In Midstream, DCP has several growth projects underway. These include developments in the Niobrara, Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Granite Wash plays, along with logistic opportunities in the Mid-Continent region. DCP recently announced an agreement to construct a new NGL pipeline that will originate in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Weld County, Colorado and extend approximately 435 miles to Skellytown, Texas in Carson County. ","The new front-range pipeline with connections to the Mid-America pipeline system and the recently announced Texas Eastern pipeline will help producers in the DJ Basin maximize the value of their NGL production by providing takeaway capacity and market access to the Gulf Coast. In addition, DCP is also building a Sand Hills NGL pipeline to provide additional NGL takeaway capacity in the Permian and Eagle Ford. ","In Chemicals, CPChem announced additional fractionation capacity of 30,000 to 40,000 BOE per day -- barrels per day at Sweeny. CPChem is progressing with one of its affiliates in Saudi Arabia to build a manufacturing facility that will produce olefins, polyolefins and alpha olefins. Production is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year, and CPChem has a 35% interest in this JV. CPChem also plans to construct a 1-hexene plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast with a capacity of 440 million pounds per year. Start-up is expected in 2014. ","CPChem continues to progress plans for construction of a $5 billion worldscale ethylene cracker at Cedar Bayou, Texas. A final investment decision is expected either later this year or early in 2013, and that facility would take about 4 years to construct following a final investment decision. ","We have -- and then finally, for Phillips 66, we have 2 of our refineries on the market. Due to the increased -- due to interest from potential buyers, we're extending the timing for our trainer disposition to late May, and we also continue to market the Alliance refinery. ","So that concludes our remarks on ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. As I mentioned earlier, the company's on target to complete its repositioning in the 2 independent leading energy companies on the 1st of May. We\u2019d like to direct you to look at our Investor Relations website for the recent presentations given by Ryan Lance for ConocoPhillips and Greg Garland for Phillips 66. ","So that concludes the prepared remarks, and we're ready to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Doug Terreson from ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So you guys have covered a lot the past few Mondays, but in E&P, and specifically in exploration, Jeff, you mentioned Poland and Bangladesh along with a host of others. And so I just wanted to see what the drilling plan was for those 2 countries during the next 12 months or so. It seems like there's momentum there. And also, any commentary that you may have on recent exploration development activities in China.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","In Bangladesh, it's too early for us. We're just in the seismic phase right now, so we don't have -- too early for us to really give any thoughts around drilling programs there. In Poland, we're going to continue at kind of the pace we are at and to try to further delineate that play. But it will be relatively low levels of expenditure there going forward. On Bohai Bay, we are in the process of going through a ramp-up of production to the levels that have been approved by the authorities. We're still in the process of working through the long-term development plan for the field. That's going to take us up to around 40,000 BOE per day. It's about 19,000 or so, net to ConocoPhillips at Bohai Bay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a number of kind of small questions. On the bitumen pricing for upstream, it looked like your equity affiliates pricing was much lower than your consolidated operations. And I guess historically, that number has always been much higher. I suspect that's because of the joint venture with Synovis. If you could just elaborate a little bit on what's going on there. Why has the pricing shifted now to a discount versus your consolidated operations?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think you probably see those move back and forth over time, and I wouldn't assume that there's going to be a discount on all of them going forward. There was a particularly wide WTI, WCS differential in the first quarter, which we've seen close somewhat in the first month of the second quarter. We're getting an increased production from Christina Lake, which is also has a little bit higher transportation differences as well. But as I said, I think you will see -- we don't expect to see differentials as wide as what we saw this quarter. Or I think you can also expect that over time, you'll see similar realizations from both the consolidated and the nonconsolidated.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then on Alaska, too, it seemed like given the production and pricing in Alaska that your earnings in Alaska were clearly higher than it's been in the past. Could you also give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Sorry to bog you down with small questions.","Clayton C. Reasor","Yes. That may be one way. We might have to circle back. But \u2026","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I mean generally in Alaska, there's a couple of factors which can affect kind of quarter-to-quarter. There's a bit of a pricing lag on some of the crude. So in a rising market, that can have a difference. And then of course, the tax regime in Alaska when you get up to these kinds of oil prices, that takes as a very high marginal take to you -- take. But I guess, as Clayton says, we can get back to you again with that.","Clayton C. Reasor","[Indiscernible] more detail on that.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, to me, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that CPChem is investing more capital on its operations this year. So they're retaining more of their cash flows that was allocated for distributions? Is that the same for DCP? So if you can just give a little more color how those distributions from CPChem and DCP would be for the year.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So, yes, I think maybe I'll -- let me clarify and make sure that I was clear on what we said about CPChem. You are correct in that both of them have good opportunities to invest capital. But generally, we would think that distributions will be coming out of both of those joint ventures, they can more than fund their capital programs with cash flows. What's unique at CPChem currently is that we are -- we've made the decision to essentially delever CPChem and pay off their debt balances post the spin happening. So CPChem is not making any distributions to either of the partners currently. So the record earnings that they saw in the first quarter were all retained at CPChem. That'll put CPChem in a position later this year where they have a cash balance sufficient to pay off the debt at CPChem and then, I think, we would start to see some distributions from that joint venture.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And is it the same thing with DCP or what? Can you give us more detail on that, too?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No. I think we actually -- we continue to see distributions out of DCP, the cash flow there.","Clayton C. Reasor","My understanding, Faisel, is that the funding for DCP expansion, about 2\/3 of that financing comes from dropping assets down into the MLP inside of DCP, DPM. And about 1\/3 of the funding of their expansion comes from either noncash expenses like DNA or from about, let's say, 10% of their net income or any cash they have on the balance sheet. So they're expecting to continue to dividend out cash, as well as fund their expansion programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess some clarifications, then a question on CapEx in SAGD. Firstly, just on that $450 million in the held-for-sale category. So if we were trying to think of sort of cash flow before working capital, would $4.6 billion be closer to the right number to use?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's right. So were it not for that, we would have seen about -- when you look at our supplemental information, you'll see that working capital is basically a push for the quarter. So were it not for that reclassification, you would have had about a $500 million use of cash from working capital. But if you're looking at cash flow before the working capital changes, what you said is correct.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on CapEx, obviously, if we take in the upstream the sort of $4.15 billion, take out $500 million for leaseholds, multiply it by 4, rack [ph] back the leaseholds, you get to about $15.1 million. And normally, CapEx in the upstream companies tends to be a bit back-end weighted. So just trying to see what might be different this year in terms of being able to hit the $15 billion of guidance.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think what's different this year is, it's not back-end loaded. We had, as many of you mentioned, the large leasehold acquisitions. We also had a fairly high spend level at the APLNG project in the first quarter as well. And we're running a pretty consistent spin through our unconventional developments like the Eagle Ford. So you won't see the same level of back-end loading in our capital program this year.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the final question on SAGD CapEx, the presentation that Lance gave last week, it was a $2.3 billion spend in SAGD. As we focus in a little bit more granularly on some of these assets, can you maybe just talk through what the sort of run rate or spends you'd have on the SAGD would be going forward, if there's any lumpiness to it or trends?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so I need to break that into a couple of pieces there, Ed. So if you look at how we fund the Foster Creek, Christina Lake joint venture, it goes back to how the venture was set up to start with, where we are making payments into the SCCL joint venture of -- it's around $800 million or $900 million a year, every year for what will be 10 years. We're about 5 or 6 years into that right now. And Synovis is doing the same thing on the WRB side. So between that contribution that we make and the cash flows that are generated inside the joint venture, that funds SCCL CapEx for us. So the $800 million or $900 million that I talked about is the SCCL CapEx, and the rest of it is the development of the Surmont project or 50-50 joint venture with Total.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things for me, hopefully, both relatively housekeeping. The first one is on your comments, Jeff, on shutting in gas. Can you just give us an idea, what would it take for you to bring your gas production back online? And given that prices have deteriorated somewhat since you made the decision, I guess, at the end of the fourth quarter, can you just give us some thoughts as to whether the portfolio is -- that you are still producing to date, is resilient at current gas prices? Or is it likely to get a little bit more aggressive there? My follow-up is on share buybacks, please.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, Doug, I'm not sure that we'll see much change from where we are right now. Again, maybe to reiterate some comments that we made when we talked about this previously. If you look at our gas production across the Lower 48 and Canada, North American natural gas production, probably 2\/3 to 70% of it, the economics of gas production are driven by liquids prices. So you don't see much -- there's no real reason to be shutting in that gas production. It still has strong economics. Of the 30% to 1\/3 that's left of that, we operate about 1\/2 of that production. Generally, our partners have not wanted to shut in production. Then we'll continue to monitor the balance of what we operate that isn't where -- the gas is more dry gas for potential additional shut-ins. But right now, we wouldn't expect it to be markedly different than what we saw in the first quarter.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Jeff, when you say shut-in gas, are you actually shutting in wells, or are you choking them back? I'm thinking about shut-in royalty commitments that you might have.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It probably varies from place to place. I think, for the most part, we're actually shutting them in. And royalty commitments and things like that are things we look at and evaluating whether or not we shut in.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. My follow-up is really a very simple one, hopefully, on share buybacks. Whatever shares you've repurchased by the end of this month, does that still impact the share count for PSX? And can you help maybe quantify what that number would be?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. So, yes, it would impact the share count for PSX. And we've talked about doing $5 billion by the end of the second quarter. We did $2 billion, basically, in the first quarter, and it's a pretty ratable purchase across the quarter.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to be clear then, if you did, let's say, $3 billion in the balance of the second quarter, I'm trying to understand how much -- I know it's a very small point, really, but how much would be allocated wholly to -- $1 billion in April? Okay, great. That answers the question.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Close enough to that, but for -- around that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to confirm when you all talk about $5 billion to $10 billion of asset sales, you're not counting the Phillips 66 dividend within that. And then I guess, a related point is, when you talk about using asset sales for stock buyback, does that dividend also count as potential proceeds to supplement your stock buyback?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No. Okay, no. So what we are saying on the ConocoPhillips side, is that we would anticipate over the next year that we're going to have between $8 billion and $10 billion of asset sales. And then ConocoPhillips is going to have about $5 billion of share repurchases by the end of the second quarter. And as I just mentioned, we'll probably have about $3 billion of that done by the time of the spin. Then we'll do another $2 billion probably in the balance of the second quarter. And then after that, the pace of share repurchase will sync up with the pace of further asset sales. So when we talk about asset sales, we're not trying to -- we're not counting the dividend, we're not counting the Phillips 66 shares. It's just the straight asset sales.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think I got it then. So if you do sell $8 billion or $10 billion or some other number, that would be the ballpark by which you\u2019d do future stock buybacks beyond what you just talked about for the second quarter?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. I think we would -- of course, we're going to be evaluating everything going forward, just where we earn cash from operations, what the investment opportunities in the portfolio look like and where we want to be on the debt balance. There'll be a lot of things that go into the mix. But if you go back to the -- really, what Jim Mulva said back in his presentation in March, where he said $5 billion by the end of the second quarter, and we hope to be around $10 billion depending on the pace of asset sales, that's the same kind of guidance we would give.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's great. And then just one E&P follow-up. You mentioned some of the work you did in the Niobrara. Where is that program for you guys? How many wells have you drilled? Where are you in terms of being sort of encouraged in terms of your position and where do you think it can go over time?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I don't have those details right in front of me. What -- we may have to get back to you on...","Clayton C. Reasor","I'd say we're early days.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, it's still pretty early days. And I'm not exactly sure how much we're talking quite yet about the Niobrara.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And I'm sorry, just one very quick final one. The 24,000 barrels a day you said for the Bakken, is that Williston Basin or is that actually Bakken?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's Bakken.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you had done any kind of -- I'm sure you have, done a look back on Bohai Bay and determined the overall financial impact as a result of the incident, and obviously, there's opportunity cost we can get with that. But there's some adjustment we have to do for the fiscal regime there, the cleanup effort directly and also the settlement. Do you have a total figure that we could use to cross-check around that?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Not that we really want to -- no, we don't, really. And we're still in the middle of discussions on Bohai Bay with the authorities there. It probably would be better for us to get everything resolved and then talk about that.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you give any more clarity on the fiscal take there and what -- I mean, your production volumes as reported for ConocoPhillips are already net of the sort of PSC effect. And then I guess on top of that, we need to apply an income tax, any sort of incremental excise tax or how do we think about the government take of your net share of production?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Well, the production number we talked about was our net share of production, which includes the effects, the PSC effects. I mean, other -- I don't think we would really want to provide exact kind of what the fiscal regime is absolute to those barrels. I mean, it is high-quality production with good margins. It's above average production. It's above average margin for us.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And any estimate on overall dollars spent for the cleanup efforts? I mean not just -- not speaking to any kind of settlement or ongoing negotiation, but just actual cash outlay to resolve the incident?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I don't have that figure in front of me, Robert. We can probably get back to you on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I hate to belabor the share buyback question, but if I can just confirm, the $2 billion post split in the second quarter, are we to think about that as being solely at the upstream? Or is that a combination of both upstream and downstream?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's at the upstream. That's a ConocoPhillips guidance. Right.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So at post split, it'll just continue on the upstream?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Correct.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And then on your production guidance, obviously, we have some gas shut-in. I know you had contemplated the return of Libya. I'm not exactly sure at what level, but obviously, Libya has come back fairly quickly. In your assumptions, can you talk about what's embedded in there? In other words, are the shut-ins in natural gas already in that 1.55 to 1.6 number?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I mean it's part of the reason why we give ranges on production and guidance is that, yes, that is -- we have our uncertainties of exactly what rate Bohai will ramp back up with and just other things in our portfolio. Just as far as Libya is concerned, Libya production, I believe, in the quarter, was around 36 a day, which is about 6 higher than it was in the first quarter of 2011.","Clayton C. Reasor","And I don't really -- based on our forecast, we don't see that going higher than that for the year. I mean, it's pretty flat looking out through the remainder of 2012.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. The last one, if I could ask one on APLNG. I know it may be early days on this, but you're looking at FID, potentially, in the second quarter. My understanding is the real, I guess, incremental returns from that project were going to come from trains 3 and 4. Do you have any clue when we may be evaluating those?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think we're going to just have to see how things develop, whether ultimately, there's a train 3 or 4 or whether it makes sense to take any additional resource we find to lengthen the life of the first 2 trains or we don't know whether there may actually be capacity in others' trains that could make sense to use longer term. So it's really too early for us to try to make an estimate on whether or not there will be additional trains there. There just be a lot of options, but what we think is still a very high quality resource.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, I want to come back to the buybacks on asset sales again. Given the fact that you're forecasting $5 billion by the end of the second quarter, and you're now linking pretty closely your share buybacks to your asset sales, is it a fair assumption to say that by the end of the first half, you\u2019ll have sold $5 billion of the $8 billion to $10 billion you're talking about? And what sort of production impact is that going to be?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No. I think when we think of the share repurchase program we're currently doing in the first half of the year, we're more looking backwards at the asset sales that we have done in the previous -- first part of this year and the latter part of last year. So we're not -- I wouldn't carry that link across to things being done in the second quarter.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can I ask a couple of questions on where you talked about as far as ...","Clayton C. Reasor","While on the production, Iain, I guess Vietnam is in there, right? So impact of production on second quarter from asset sales, I think, Jeff said were...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's 20,000 to 30,000. The biggest chunk of that is Vietnam. We've got some things in the North Sea and some smaller assets in North America that could close in the second quarter, relatively small amounts there.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So 20,000 to 30,000 is really already done?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, a lot of that was Vietnam. Correct.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, and just a couple of questions about -- you mentioned taxes and also an underlift as being fairly significant negatives in the first quarter. Is taxes kind of become the continuation of the North Sea effect in Alaska? Or is there something else there which we don't know about?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It's primarily the North Sea effect. The U.K. tax increase that happened last year.","Clayton C. Reasor","The second quarter, I guess, so it impacted the first quarter.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, right. And then Alaska, again, it's a pretty progressive tax regime at the current price environments.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the underlift, what about that? That seems like a fairly substantial number for an underlift?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, it was fairly substantial. We see numbers of about that size. Well, really -- no, it is a fairly high number for an underlift. It's not completely unprecedented. It just has to do with timings of when cargoes get lifted.","Clayton C. Reasor","And unfortunately, the ones that did affect it were international that had relatively higher margins.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we're talking about Australia or the U.K., something like that?","Clayton C. Reasor","Yes, above average margins.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Clayton, I just want to make sure I understand, you're saying that the underlift is primarily relate to Australia or that it's not related to Libya. I thought the underlift would be primarily related to Libya?","Clayton C. Reasor","No. The underlift is -- you have underlifts and overlifts all throughout the portfolio, so it's a netting effect that this quarter netted to that kind of number. So we were overlifted in some places, we're underlifted in others. It's just the balance this time ended up with a number that we felt was significant enough we should mention it.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Jeff, maybe that I must be missing something, maybe you can help me. I was looking in the first quarter, your oil and gas realization is roughly about $66.7 per BOE. It's about $2 higher than the fourth quarter. Even after I take into consideration of the underlift of $85 million, your net income for the whole year is still about $15 versus in the fourth quarter, it's about $16. Your production is actually somewhat up. So -- and you're saying that -- is that the reason why the unit cost out there -- unit margin is down? You said because, sequentially, we have a higher unit cost or is there something that we're missing?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, it's primarily driven by things like the timing on the underlift, like we've mentioned. It's driven by the fact that natural gas prices were lower in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter last year. NGL prices were lower in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter last year. Bitumen prices were lower in the fourth -- lower as well. Crude prices were up. And the mix of all those things...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But, Jeff, I'm sorry, but what I did is that I did look at what you report as your crude oil price and your bitumen price and your natural gas price. I did a calculation based on what you report. Your average realization per BOE net of all those what you mentioned actually sequentially is up about $2 per barrel. That is what I am -- seems I am at a loss.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Okay, we'll have to work with you on that one. I'm not sure how your -- what your calculation is. We'll have to take that one off-line.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, I will do that, if I could. Clayton, do you have an actual fully diluted share cost [ph] at the end of the quarter, March 31?","Clayton C. Reasor","We probably do. Do you have that, Jeff?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, I just have the average in front of me. No, I don't. We can get that to you. I mean it will be on the face of the 10-Q that we file next week.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I mean you guys have it, that you can show me a complete [indiscernible] per share?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, we can do that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that the reposition cost, Jeff, do you guys have an estimate on what that total is going to be?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So it was $95 million in the first quarter. It's been $120 million if you look at across the fourth quarter and the first quarter. It's going to be -- you'll see it. It'll be hard to track after this because it's going to be reported in 2 separate companies. But most -- probably the majority of the repositioning costs are behind us now.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on a going-forward basis, on a sustainable basis, what is the estimated increase in your higher G&A costs at the 2 separate companies? Do you have a number that you can share?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","It'll split evenly between the companies, and for both companies, I think we're saying it'll be around $75 million to $100 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Per year?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Per year, right.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pretax or after-tax basis?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's an after-tax number.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","After-tax. Okay. And in Poland, Jeff, is there some drilling result you can share with us so far?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","There's not drilling results that we are sharing yet.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The final 2 questions. In Bakken, Permian Basin and Eagle Ford, do you have a breakdown of what is your production as a percentage of frac oil, condensate and NGL?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so Eagle Ford is 60% crude or condensate.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Do you have a further breakdown between crude oil and condensate?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","No, I don't, because those 2 price very similarly.","Clayton C. Reasor","About 20% NGLs.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","About 20% NGLs and about 20% natural gas. The Bakken is basically 90% crude and 5%, say, NGLs and 5% gas. Permian is...","Clayton C. Reasor","I got it. 53% -- or 50% to 55% crude; 10% to 15% NGLs; and the balance would be gas.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's of our current Permian production. So if you look at the things we're bringing on there, I think there's probably a higher weighting to the liquids side.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And it seems that, I mean, the refinery, don't we need one condensate per se? So that's why I wanted to see a breakdown between the condensate and frac oil. I mean, as of today, I don't think there's such a big difference in terms of the pricing. But is it possible that over the next 2 or 3 years, as we continue to ramp up the condensate and with no readily available local market for that, we would start to see big differences between the condensate pricing and the frac oil pricing?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's something I don't have a view on right now, Paul.","Clayton C. Reasor","Yes, I mean I guess, you're saying that our refineries aren't going to be interested in running very light liquids production [indiscernible] find a home outside the U.S.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I mean, you're going to max out on your distillation tower on the very late end. So I mean, there\u2019s really not much you can run, especially if you're going to see more of the WCS coming down, then they will occupy some of the light barrel, light column already.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I'm sure we will see some short-term dislocations in the market as we build out these plays in the next few years. But longer term, when you think about products like propanes, butanes, condensates, those are something that you can export. So that will also help any differentials that might be there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Clayton, is there any possibility if you can, say, maybe help us there by giving us the breakdown between your condensate and your frac oil mix in those areas? That would be really appreciated.","Clayton C. Reasor","Yes, we've got some follow-up to do with you, Paul.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time, we have a question from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kind of a big picture one about the dividend. You will have unquestionably the highest dividend yield of any independent oil and gas company. And I'm just curious, your thoughts on how that positions you vis-\u00e0-vis the investment days. It's obviously not a typical, not a commonplace model for independence. So just your thoughts on that.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's a great question because that is really kind of a fundamental difference of ConocoPhillips and much else that's out there in the marketplace today. And you can see that when we put out our investor update, we titled it as a new class of investment, kind of pointing out that difference. I mean, in many ways, we've got the assets of a major. We're going to try to have the nimbleness and culture of an independent. But from a distribution point of view, we feel like we're of a size and of a maturity, and in an industry where shareholders should be expecting that a significant portion of cash flow comes back to them in the form of a dividend. And we've talked about that being 20% to 25% of our cash flow. And that ends up giving us a dividend that's like what the integrated company has today. And we recognize that, that's going to give us a pretty high yield going out of the box. But we think that's an issue, not with the dividend, but with the share price, and that that's going to be something that will change over time. We still would be looking to maintain that kind of payout ratio longer term and also to see increases in the dividend as our earnings and our cash flow grows over time.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that same point, is there an oil price level where you would begin to be concerned about maintaining share buyback at the rate that you're currently doing, especially given that, I think as you indicated, your asset sale program may not extend that much into 2013?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Well, as prices change, we're always looking at the whole mix of things that we use our cash flow for. Though, basically, we want to maintain a capital program that's fairly consistent across the years, we don't want to be moving that up and down. We want to have a dividend that's, like I just discussed, that's at the level it is today and grows over time. We've got a lot of capacity on our balance sheet to handle short-term swings in prices. So if we get a big change in prices, we'll look and adjust. But in the near term, it probably would not see large adjustments on the upside or the downside as prices moved either up or down to the size of our capital program. And on share repurchases, we're always going to be evaluating what the best use of our proceeds are. As we look out today, we think it's reasonable guidance to say that we'll be using proceeds from asset sales to fund share repurchases.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session due to time constraints. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Reasor for closing remarks.","Clayton C.

My name is Senera and I'll be the operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. ","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may now begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Senera. Hello, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today's prepared remarks will be delivered by Don Wallette, our EVP and CFO and Matt Fox, EVP and our Chief Operating Officer. Our three region presidents are also in the room with us today. They are Bill Bullock, the President of our Asia-Pacific, Middle East region, Michael Hatfield, the President of our Alaska, Canada and Europe region and Dominic Macklon, the President of our Lower 48 region.","Page 2 of today's presentation deck shows our cautionary statement. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide and also in our periodic SEC filings.","We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website.","One final comment before I turn the call over to Don, given that our November Analyst and Investor meeting is only a few weeks away we're going to limit questions to one per person and ask that questions address today's earnings release or recent announcements.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don.","Don Wallette","Thanks, Ellen, and good morning all. I'll begin with the third quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance, we realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production volumes combined with lower overall costs to mitigate the impacts of reduced marker prices. Cash from operations was $2.6 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued with a return on capital employed at just under 11% on a trailing 12-month basis.","Moving to the middle column, operationally in the quarter we produced 1.32 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 7% on an underlying basis compared with the year ago quarter and up 12% on a per share basis. Matt will cover the rest of the operations highlights in a moment.","On the strategic side earlier this month, we announced a 38% increase to our quarterly dividend which reflects the company's improved underlying financial strength, as well as our commitment to peer leading capital returns to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased $750 million of shares in the quarter and announced our plan to buy back $3 billion of shares in 2020.","In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've returned over 40% of CFO to our shareholders. We closed the sale of our E&P assets in the UK in September, which generated $2.2 billion in proceeds and as recently announced we entered into definitive agreements for the sale of our Australia West business.","If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash flows for the quarter. We began the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion. Moving to the right cash from operations was $2.6 billion. There were a couple of items impacting cash from operations in the quarter that are noted here. First, in conjunction with the UK sale we made a one-time top-up contribution to the pension plan, such that it is now fully funded and essentially self sufficient. That $320 million can be viewed as an acceleration of future pension contributions.","And second, as we do each quarter, we note the cash received during the quarter associated with the PDVSA settlement. To-date, we've received over $750 million related to the $2 billion settlement agreement reached in the third quarter of last year.","Working capital was a $300 million use of cash and as mentioned, we recognized $2.2 billion in proceeds from closing of the UK disposition. Capital spending was $1.7 billion resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter. And we distributed $1.1 billion or 41% of CFO to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share buybacks, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $8.4 billion.","So as you can see this past quarter once again continued our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. It also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning capital to shareholders. We firmly believe that ours is a sustainable, distinctive and compelling value proposition, one that is highly competitive, not only within the energy sector, but also across the broader market.","With that I will turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights, and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we safely completed our third quarter turnarounds at Prudhoe, the Western North Slope and Kuparuk and closed the Nuna discovered resource acquisition. We also continue to progress appraisal of our Willow and Narwhal discoveries. Earlier this month we spud another horizontal well from an existing Alpine drill site into the Narwhal trend. The well is designed to provide offset injection to the horizontal producer we drilled earlier in the year and help us optimize future development planning. We're also gearing up for the winter exploration, appraisal and project execution season.","Moving to Canada, we completed commissioning of the Montney gas plant this quarter. Due to delays in the third-party pipeline, we now expect that project to be online in early 2020. As Surmont our alternative diluent project is on track for start-up in the fourth quarter as planned. In fact, we are actively transitioning today start condensate blending for Dilbit sales beginning on November 1.","This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we require but also provide blend flexibility and consistently improve our netbacks. And the Lower 48 Big 3 third quarter production by asset was Eagle Ford at 226,000 barrels equivalent per day, Vulcan a 102 and Delaware at 51 for a total of 379,000. As we indicated last quarter, we expect Big 3 production to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year and we're on target to achieve a full-year growth rate of about 21%. Lastly in the Lower 48, we now have 3 vintage 5 multi-well pilot pads online in the Eagle Ford and you'll hear more about that in a few weeks.","Moving over to Europe, the UK disposition closed and we successfully transitioned operatorship. In Norway partner-operated turnarounds were safely completed in the third quarter. In Qatar, we've been invited to submit a bid for the North Field expansion project. And then, Malaysia production ramp up at KBB continued through the quarter and we expect to reach full throughput by year-end. In addition, Gumusut Phase II came online in August. And finally in Australia, we announced the divestiture of our Australia West assets for $1.4 billion, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to progress Barossa and remain on schedule for FID by early next year. So, we've had another strong quarter of execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio.","Now I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we enter the last quarter of 2019, we're continuing our focus on execution, while maintaining capital discipline. Our full-year operating plan capital guidance remains unchanged at $6.3 billion, excluding about $300 million of opportunistic low cost of supply resource positions that we discussed last quarter. On the production side full-year guidance also remains unchanged, except for updating for the close of our UK asset divestiture. With that in mind, we now expect the fourth quarter to average between 1.265 million and 1.305 million barrels equivalent per day but the full-year guidance between 1.3 million and 1.31 million barrels a day.","So, we remain on track to deliver 5% underlying full-year production growth and combined with our buyback program that results in 10% production growth per share. Finally, we're looking forward to our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined plan that delivers free cash flow and strong returns. And of course we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our continued strong performance highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the remainder of our 2019 plan and we look forward to sharing our longer term plans with you in November.","Now we'll open up for questions on the quarter.","Questions-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yes. Hi, good morning. First question here, just as you said on the quarter. As we look ahead here to the fourth quarter guidance, it looks like from your prepared remarks, the production outlook was just meant to be an adjustment for the closing of the UK transaction. Just wanted to confirm that. And if there are any other moving pieces we might want to be thinking about for the quarter? Thanks.","Matt Fox","Yeah. Phil. Yeah, it really is just an adjustment for the UK Change. It's a bit less of an increase from the third to the fourth quarter than we usually see, but that's mostly because we've had front-end loaded production in the Lower 48 and Qatar. And it's also influenced to some extent by the fact that Montney start-up has slipped into the first quarter because of this delay in the third-party pipeline, but really primarily just reflecting the change in the UK.","Phil Gresh","Okay, got it. And then just one for Don, on the cash flow, you've had a decent working capital headwind year-to-date and I was just wondering if there are any transitory dynamics there that could reverse some of that in the fourth quarter, and then obviously I think we're going to get a step up in the APLNG distributions as well, correct?","Don Wallette","Yeah, Phil, on the APLNG distributions, yeah, we do expect the even quarters to be high and the odd quarters to be low. So we'll continue that trend. We had $60 million distributed in the third quarter. I would expect that number to grow to about $300 million in the fourth quarter. So still pretty consistent with what I guided to last time, which I think was $750 million for the year on APLNG. On working capital, we had $300 million use in the quarter and there we saw an increase in accounts receivable due to some sales timings on liftings in Norway and Malaysia both and a decrease in accounts payable of about the same -- about $150 million and that's just normal payment timing. So there's really not a lot going on there. I wouldn't suggest that we have a trend line that we're following.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wonder, again trying to stick to the quarter I guess with also one of the things you included in your slide today Matt, your decision to exit Barossa in the middle of the quarter, but yet prepared to still consider investing in Qatar. I just wondered if you could walk us through your thinking in terms of LNG market outlook, why exiting one and still being involved in another might make sense for you guys and maybe if I you get out, can I add a Part B to that. Just it was like international gas prices were a little bit better this time. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any improvement or is that just a lag effect on pricing? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Doug. We decided to exit the ABUs not because we're concerned about the cost of supply there. We actually think that as a competitive project, but the -- we concluded that the we should monetize those assets and redirect capital to higher returning projects across the rest of our portfolio. So it was a pretty straightforward allocation of capital decision for us to make the decision that with the ABUs. We are still interested in the Qatar North Field expansion and the -- we think that will also be a very competitive cost of supply LNG project and we will continue to progress those discussions with Qatar, as we go through the rest of the year and into next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question...","Ellen DeSanctis","Excuse me, Senera, we'll complete the answer to Doug's second part of the questions.","Don Wallette","Yeah. Doug, you had a question about LNG realizations in the third quarter. So I just wanted to address that and you're right, it is the lag effect in pricing the way these long-term contracts work. So for example, in the quarter, Brent, as you know it was down about $7 from the previous quarter but JCC pricing was up $8. So what you're seeing is just the lag effect on LNG realizations.","Ellen DeSanctis","Go ahead, Senera, we'll take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. And I apologize about that. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, team. The first question I had was around Qatar. Can you remind us again, Matt, just around the mechanics of production, to extent do you have a heavy first half weighted production run in Qatar, does that come -- did you come up against any caps or restrictions on volumes as you get into the fourth quarter?","Matt Fox","Yeah. The -- so we've already talked as we've gone through the year about the front-end loaded nature of the Lower 48. In Qatar there is an annual limits to total production that we can produce there in Qatar and we had very strong performance through the first three quarters. So that means that we choke back in the fourth quarter to meet our limit. And that's something that's been in place from the beginning of Qatar, but it's been a bit more pronounced this year because performance has been so strong in the first three quarters.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, and then you're drilling down into the Lower 48. Can you just walk us through each of the 3 regions and what you're seeing from a volume perspective as we go into the fourth quarter and anything notable that you would call out in terms of how the performance is play-by-play?","Dominic Macklon","Yeah. Thanks, Neil. It's Dominic here. I mean I think in terms of Q4 outlook here on the Big 3 all pretty flat I think Eagle Ford pretty flat from Q3 into Q4, Bakken had a good strong quarter in Q3, it's probably relatively flat into Q4, we may see some weather impacts in December up the in North Dakota, of course, we will see a little bit of growth in the Delaware. But overall, our guidance is relatively flat, Q4 for the Big 3 versus Q3. We will see continued growth in 2020 in the Big 3 and we look forward to talking about that in November.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Hi, everybody. So my question is about the implications of divestitures in the North Sea and Western Australia on your total corporate retirement obligations and specifically how you expect those to change once those asset sales close?","Don Wallette","Yeah. Doug. This is Don. Yeah, I can give you some guidance around the asset retirement obligations. In the UK , I think we've already published that, but that's $1.8 billion of reduction in ARO and then in, let's say, Australia West assuming that completes in the first quarter of next year, we would expect that ARO reduction to be about $650 million. So combined between the two major asset sales, we'd see a $2.5 billion reduction, that's about 30% of our balance.","Doug Terreson","Oh wow. Okay. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Roger Read","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I was just curious, given that the winter program is already pretty set, I'm just kind of curious about an update there, what we may look for in the coming months?","Michael Hatfield","Yeah. Hi, Roger. This is Michael. We're gearing up for our winter drilling program now. In fact, this upcoming winter program will be our largest ever. We'll drill wells that at Willow, at Narwhal and Harpoon and we're looking forward to sharing the details of that program at our meeting in November. There's really nothing further to share at this point.","Roger Read","All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys. Good morning. Matt, Just curious that on Montney, I think you guys are targeting on the condensate window. What's the API you're targeting because one of the push back we heard from people is that the update that people actually want to have a higher API condensate, so that the used lesser of the pipeline space, and when they blend it with the bitumen. So from that standpoint, I mean why that you guys think that you're condensate if you get from there, even if it is a lower API you will have a good market?","Michael Hatfield","Yes, thanks Paul. This is Michael again. Our liquids in Montney is about half of our product mix and about two-thirds of our revenue mix. About over half of that is condensate, and it's a fairly wide condensate, it's about 40 degrees. It's not linked physically with our Surmont asset. We'll sell the condensate into the market, and in fact we're in the process of just waiting on the third-party pipeline to start up our gas plant probably early next year. And so we'll start to see production results from this first pad, that will bring online at that time. So the condensate and other products will all be sold into the market in Canada, which is actually a pretty strong market in terms of condensate.","Paul Cheng","And Michael, I'm sorry, what did you say what is the API for your condensate?","Michael Hatfield","Yeah, it's around -- it's in the 40 degree range, plus or minus.","Paul Cheng","40? Okay, that seems pretty low. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Mizuho Securities USA. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Thank you. Hi, all. We had question about the maintenance capital levels that will be ongoing after the disposals you made, Matt. So we wanted just to know what the impact is on spending on an ongoing basis from the disposals. And if I could follow up on the M&A theme. Could you talk a little bit about the $300 million of opportunistic add-ons, I think you call them, what are the parameters for those deals and do we assume that the parameters that you're using there would be similarly applied to a bigger deal if you made one? Thank you.","Matt Fox","Okay. Yeah Thanks, Paul. The maintenance capital. I assume you're referring to the sustaining capital number that we are...","Paul Sankey","Yeah exactly, sustaining is what I should have said.","Matt Fox","Yeah. No, that's same. It's sort of interchangeable. But the so that's around $3.8 billion and that continues here. In fact, it continues through the next decade when we talk about some in a few weeks. So, there is no significant change there. There's some puts and takes with the acquisitions and growth in the unconventionals but it stays around $3.8 billion and that keeps or sustaining price, which is what we're really focused on well below $40 a barrel. The -- on the M&A front, it's really -- you referred to the $300 million the spend this year on acquisition capital. So those were adding positions in Alaska at the Nuna trend that's now closed in the Lower 48 adding for the most part royalty acreage within our coexisting operated positions. Some smaller additions in the Montney continue to calling up there and then the entrance into the Vaca Muerta play in Argentina and there's nothing new in this quarter from in that respect.","But the -- yes, they sort of decision criteria, when we are thinking about those it's basically we're focused as we are in all of our capital investments on the cost of supply. So we have to be able to see the acquisition price plus the development cost of supply in aggregate being competitive with other sources of resource additions. And again, that's something that we'll talk about -- more about in November, just philosophically how we think about all event and in the context of asset or corporate acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Jeanine Wai","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Hi, hello. In terms of Alaska, and I think this question qualifies because it's on recent news, do you see anything changing from an operating perspective now that you have a new partner with BP exiting, and have you had maybe any early conversations and could there be some upside there? And I guess what we're getting at also is because we've noticed that you spent almost all of the full year budget in Alaska already?","Michael Hatfield","Yes, Jeanine. This is Michael, again. So with the transition from Hilcorp -- sorry from BP to Hilcorp, it's still early stages. So we're still pending the successful close of that transaction, with Hilcorp does have a track record in Alaska rejuvenating mature fields. They've reduced lifting costs, they've increased development activity and increased production in these other fields. And so we expect to see a reduction in operating costs and a renewed focus on investments. Now any capital plans for Prudhoe Bay require the approval of Hilcorp, Exxon and ConocoPhillips and so while we work very closely today with BP, as the operator we'll continue to work closely with Hilcorp as they come in and Exxon to maximize the value of this legacy asset. So we're excited for this transaction, we see opportunity to unlock more value at Prudhoe Bay.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. And just saying we'll stay tuned. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Bob Brackett","Another Alaska related question. If we think about the fair share Act ballot initiative. Can you talk about that and perhaps put it in the context of the longer-term ebb and flow of tax policy up on the North Slope?","Michael Hatfield","Yeah. Thanks, Bob. This is Michael, again. It's a situation that we are monitoring very closely. I'd say this initiative is not in the best long-term interest of the Alaskan citizens. We believe the Alaskan citizens will see the benefit that the North Slope exploration renaissance has already brought to the state and to its citizens. If you look at the positive changes that have occurred since SB 21 went into effect in 2013, ConocoPhillips and others have announced several additional discoveries and projects that could add significant incremental production and revenue to the state. And so we believe that continuing those investments is good for employment, it's good for the Alaskan economy and it's good for the Alaskan citizens. And so that's for both now and over the long-term, and so we feel like it's also worth noting that this sort of initiative has come up in the past and we've successfully informed voters of the negative consequences of jobs, production and long-term revenue, the impact of those sort of initiatives have on the benefits of -- the benefits that the citizens would see.","So we do have a long history of engagement with the public. We feel that there is a mutually beneficial relationship with the stakeholders and in short, so it's very much on our radar and something we're monitoring quite closely and we do expect, in fact, we're gearing up now to make our case to the citizens about the benefits of continuing under the fiscal regime that we currently have.","Bob Brackett","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Good morning. My question is just on capital allocation for the remainder of this year, just thinking about the unchanged budget, would have stopped there may have been some downside potential and spend just given that UK closed. So just looking for any color on where that unspent CapEx might be allocated to instead for the remainder of the year?","Matt Fox","Yeah. This is Matt, Jeoffrey, so far this year run rate has been about $1.6 billion in the quarter, that's going to drop $500 million in the 4th quarter. Part of it because of the UK disposition, but also just general phasing primarily associated with completions, and refracs and exploration timing there and it's just that those modest sort of planned changes that causes to go from a run rate of $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Michael Hall","Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate the time. I guess maybe going back up to Canada or to Alaska -- sorry, can you guys provide an exit rate on what Alaska production look like after the turnarounds?","Matt Fox","Yeah. We're producing around the 210,000 to 220,000 barrels a day at this point.","Michael Hall","Great. That's helpful. And then on the Canadian gas plant, can you just remind me what the net capacity on that is to those operations and to you?","Michael Hatfield","Yeah, the capacity is about 100 million cubic feet a day. One of the benefits that we have of the plant that we've designed here is we can design one and build many. So as we're in this appraisal mode and we ramp up to different stairsteps of production levels we'll be able to clone this plant multiple times over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James Please Please go ahead, your line is open.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick one, about gas pricing, you mentioned the lag effect benefiting LNG in the quarter by -- in your European gas pricing, it was the lowest number as far as I can remember on record, lower than in 2016 even. I'm curious why North Sea gas was so depressed in the September quarter?","Don Wallette","Hey Pavel. This is Don. Yeah, all of the markers, were down during the third quarter from Brent to WTI and Henry Hub, of course, here in the US AECO, International Gas in Europe. LNG, of course, is quite different and it's priced differently. That's why we saw the increased realizations in the third quarter. But now that's just supply and demand factor in Europe, there is a weakness in the market or there was in the third quarter and it continues in the fourth.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Understood. My follow-up a little more thematic, if I may. In your sale of Australia West did you consider including APLNG as part of the same transaction to simply exit Australia altogether?","Matt Fox","And this is Matt, Pavel. No, this was focused on the cash flow characteristics in ABUs and the nature of that asset, the stage of the lifecycle. And we didn't consider an exit of Australia in its entirety.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Leggate","I know I ask my one question already. I think that's a mistake. I can ask another one, if you like.","Matt Fox","Feel free Doug.","Doug Leggate","Well, I have you guys I actually didn't line up from other question. I feel quite embarrassed, but I had another one written down. Just on your cost guidance, I'm expecting this will come up next week, but because the costs -- well they've been running a bit light this year I'm just wondering if there is anything that we should read into that, are you doing a lot better on both operating costs. And I guess DD&A's a bit low as well but pretty much from the cash costs. But I'm guessing that's something you will address in a couple of weeks, but any comments you can share? But -- and I'll extend my gratitude to the operator for giving me the second shot. Thanks.","Don Wallette","Doug, thanks for your second question. No the operating costs continue to hold the line. In fact, in third quarter, I think our production, and operating costs and SG&A were down about 6% or so from the previous quarter. I wouldn't read a whole lot of that -- into that. Some of it was -- we had a bit higher cost in the second quarter because of the turnaround activity and we had I think a settlement litigation thing that we settled. So we see operating costs remaining essentially flat for this year. And so we're not adjusting the full-year production and operating cost guidance at this time. I mean, we can talk more about how we see that outlook going forward next month. But we continue to be aggressive on trying to keep a very efficient operating structure.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Ellen.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, Senera. Thank you to our listeners today. We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Appreciate your time and interest in ConocoPhillips.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP-Investor Relations and Communications, ConocoPhillips.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thank you, Christine, and hello to all of our participants today. With me on the call are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP of E&P. Ryan's going to open the call this morning with some comments about the general business environment and then will turn the call over to Jeff and Matt for their customary second quarter comments.","Q&A will follow that and we are going to ask that people limit their questions to one plus one follow-up.","We will make some forward-looking statements this morning. And obviously our future performance could differ from our projections due to risks and uncertainties. Those are described on page 2 of this morning's material and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","This information as well as our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and other supplemental information can be found on our website.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ellen and thank you all for joining the call today. As Ellen said, before we dive into the second-quarter results, I want to take the opportunity to provide some broad comments about our approach to the business in the current price environment.","So let me give you the punch line of these comments, the dividend is safe. Let me repeat that, the dividend is safe. The business is running well, we have increasing flexibility and can achieve cash flow neutrality in 2017 and beyond at today's strip price of roughly $60 per barrel Brent. And we have a unique formula for sustainable performance and a portfolio that can deliver.","Now let me put a little bit of meat on the bones. Weak prices have certainly dealt us and the industry a significant headwind, but the reality is we don't control prices. That said, there are many things we do control like how much capital we return to the shareholders, how much and where we spend the capital and the cost of running the business.","And rest assured, ConocoPhillips is laser focused on the things we can control. We cut our capital early in the cycle, not just for this year but for three years. We took a $1 billion cost-cutting challenge and we recently reduced spending for new deepwater opportunities. And we did this while continuing to meet our operational targets, raising our dividend modestly to continue to meet our commitment to shareholders.","Our ability to make these decisions is not accidental. Over the past few years we've built a sizable portfolio and resource base, flexibility, options and choices. It's a huge advantage at times like these.","Just as importantly, we're navigating the sharp downturn with a focus not just on the short-term measures but also a focus on the medium and the long-term horizons. This is really important and frankly it's hard to do.","So if you turn to slide four, let me provide some perspective on how we're simultaneously managing across these time horizons. First, the short term is all about safely executing the business. That means delivering on our current performance targets. As Jeff and Matt will cover, we're meeting or exceeding our short-term goals and as you saw in this morning's announcement, we're lowering guidance on operating cost and reducing our capital guidance for 2015.","That represents a significant benefit to net cash flow for the year. We also recently increased our quarterly dividend. The increase was very modest, representing about $25 million impact in 2015. While every dollar matters, we believe this was an important message for our shareholders.","At the same time, we're also paying close attention to the medium-term. And the medium-term for us is all about managing the path to cash flow neutrality in 2017. In addition to the short-term items I just mentioned we continue to focus on ways to increase our capital flexibility. If the current price environment persists, we have the flexibility to reduce our near-term capital spend below $11.5 billion and still achieve modest growth. Now stay tuned for more on this as we see where the commodity prices head later in the year.","Also, we're focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength. We have additional capacity and ample access to liquidity. And as we've continuously said, we expect a company of our size would generate about $1 billion of asset sales annually from pruning the portfolio. That's an additional source of cash and good business.","Finally, we announced a $1 billion operating cost reduction challenge for 2016 and we're on track to meet or exceed that target. These actions will help our medium-term performance but also drive sustainable improvements beyond 2017.","And that brings me to the long-term, the actions we are taking to ensure our long-term success include maintaining our capital flexibility, lowering the cost of supply across the portfolio and shortening the cycle time of our investments. These are criteria that are guiding our decisions and these were the drivers behind the recent decision to reduce our deepwater spending, which Matt will discuss in more detail.","So that's how we're managing the business through this period, by simultaneously focusing on the short, medium and long-term horizons. And we're doing it in a way that I believe meets our commitments to our shareholders and honors our priorities of a growing dividend, a strong balance sheet and growth that we can afford.","Now ultimately, our goal is to position the company for sustainable performance and this point is demonstrated on the next slide. Now we know what's on everybody's mind. What if prices stay lower for longer? Well, the left side of this chart lays out our answer. We believe we can achieve cash flow neutrality in 2017 and beyond through exercising capital flexibility even at $60 a barrel Brent.","We can exercise additional capital flexibility from various sources, deflation capture, efficiency improvements, discretion in development programs, uncommitted major projects, deepwater reductions and the additional program efficiencies. And we believe we can achieve our 2017 production target given the ramp from our major projects between now and then. The majority of which is from capital we've already invested. And this is all before tactical asset sales.","Finally, the right side of the chart shows a graphic from our April Analyst Meeting. At that meeting we discussed the quality and cost of supply of captured resource base. Today we have over 44 billion barrels of identified resource, over half of which has a very attractive cost of supply.","16 billion barrels is either proven reserves or has a cost of supply that's less than $60 per barrel. That's almost 30 years of resource at current production rates. So we have the opportunities to invest capital in captured economic programs with little resource risk. This should accelerate value for shareholders while increasing the predictability of our business. That's how we can sustain our success for the long-term.","Now I hope these comments provided some perspective on our approach to the business in this environment. The bottom line, it's a very solid and disciplined plan.","So, I'm going to come back with some closing comments, but let me turn it now over to Jeff.","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ryan. So I'll walk through our results for the quarter and then provide some updates on our 2015 guidance. I'll start with our second quarter financial performance, so that's on slide seven.","As Ryan mentioned, we operated well this quarter with production hitting the high end of guidance. We reported adjusted earnings of $81 million or $0.07 a share and these results included 4% volume growth and 14% lower operating costs compared to this quarter last year after adjusting for special items.","The story for the company and the sector this year continues to be low commodity prices. We did see a slight increase in total realized prices in the second quarter compared the first quarter which improved our sequential earnings, but year-over-year our realized price was down nearly 45%.","Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown on the lower right side of this chart. Segment adjusted earnings are roughly in line with our sensitivities and the financial details for each segment can be found in the supplemental data on our website.","Now if you'll turn to slide eight, I'll review our production results. Our second quarter production averaged nearly 1.6 million BOE per day compared to 1.56 million BOE per day in the second quarter 2014. That's growth of 4% or 69,000 BOE per day, which came primarily from liquids and from domestic gas sales of APLNG which we'll turn to LNG over time.","The waterfall also shows the difference between downtime and dispositions in the second quarter this year versus same period last year which was 30,000 barrels per day. That reflects mostly downtime in Canada from forest fires near Foster Creek and in Malaysia as a result of the Gumusut turnaround.","Now if you'll turn to the next slide I'll cover our cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. This chart provides a summary of our sources and uses of cash through the first half of the year. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash, through the end of June we generated $4.4 billion from operating activities excluding working capital. Total working capital in the first half of the year was a $1.1 billion use of cash, with the largest impact related to lower payables associated with reductions in our capital spending. We do not expect to see significant additional working capital changes associated with investing activities through the remainder of 2015.","In the first half of the year, we received $600 million in disposition proceeds. As we've previously said, with a portfolio of our size you can see $1 billion of assets sales every year as we continually high-grade the portfolio. We increased debt by $2.4 billion. The debt included fixed and floating rate bond tranches, with an average maturity of 5.6 years and an average interest rate of 1.9%.","For the first half of the year, we spent $5.7 billion in capital and that was comprised of $3.3 billion in the first quarter reducing down to $2.4 billion in the second quarter. And as we'll point out on the next slide, we're lowering our capital guidance for 2015 from $11.5 billion to $11 billion. So that puts us at $5.3 billion in capital for the second half of the year.","After paying our dividend, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet. So we remain in a strong balance sheet position with cash on hand, access to ample liquidity, as well as the potential for incremental cash from tactical asset sales.","I'll wrap up my comments on slide 10 with some guidance for the rest of the year. We are on track to achieve the high end of our 2% to 3% production growth for the year. Our third quarter production guidance is 1.51 million BOE per day to 1.55 million BOE per day, which reflects significant turnaround activity in the quarter.","We are also providing an update on several of our financial guidance items which in the aggregate will provide approximately $900 million in benefit to net cash flow in 2015. We now expect full year 2015 capital expenditures of around $11 billion compared to our previous guidance of $11.5 billion. This reflects lower capital that's roughly equal parts program efficiencies, deflation in FX and some activity deferral.","We're also making good progress on our operating cost targets, which are mostly coming from changes to the way we run our business. We still expect our operating costs to increase in the second half of the year as we continue our turnaround work and bring projects online, but given our run rate through the first half of the year, we are lowering our operating cost guidance for the year from $9.2 billion to $8.9 billion. That puts us ahead of schedule as we work towards our $1 billion cost reduction target in 2016.","Our corporate segment benefited from LNG licensing revenues during the second quarter and we're changing our full-year guidance to a net expense of $900 million from $1 billion. And there is no change to our DD&A or exploration, dry hole and impairment guidance.","That concludes the review of the financial performance and guidance. I'm going to turn it over to Matt for an update on our operations.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff and Ryan mentioned, we've had another strong quarter operationally and the business is performing well. I'll quickly run through our segment results and then turn it back to Ryan for some closing thoughts.","In the lower 48, second quarter production averaged 556,000 BOE per day. That's a 3% increase from the same period last year and represents a 9% increase in crude oil production over the same period.","We're now running 13 rigs, with six in the Eagle Ford, four in the Bakken and three in the Permian. That's down from 32 rigs at the end of 2014 and we believe this is the right pace of activity in this environment. We'll reassess these levels later in the year, taking into consideration market conditions, pilot test information and the price outlook.","With our reduced capital program, our growth in this region has started to slow and we expect production to see modest declines through the rest of the year, consistent with our prior guidance.","Looking at the Gulf of Mexico, our appraisal work is continuing, with activity in the quarter at Gila, Shenandoah and Tiber. And next I want to provide a quick update on the rest of our Gulf of Mexico program following our deepwater announcement earlier this month.","As Ryan mentioned, we recently announced a plan to reduce spending in deepwater, notably in the Gulf of Mexico. We've taken the step of terminating our agreement for a drillship and we expect to take a charge of up to $400 million as a special item in the third quarter. The drillship wasn't scheduled for delivery to the Gulf until later this year, so not a lot has changed for our 2015 drilling program.","Two exploration wells are expected to spud in the third quarter at Melmar and Vernaccia. After Melmar we will have two remaining slots on the Maersk Valiant drillship. We expect to drill a Socorro prospect with one of these slots and we're currently evaluating and high-grading our drilling prospects to fill the final operated slot.","We're going through our budgeting process for next year and we'll provide more detail on expected capital and operating cost savings for 2016 when we announce our capital budget later in the year.","Next I'll cover our Canada and Alaska segments on slide 13. We produced 306,000 BOE per day in our Canada segment, an 8% year-over-year increase. The growth came from our new wells in Western Canada as well as strong performance from our oil sands assets. In May we achieved a major milestone with first steam at Surmont 2. We're on track to start producing in the third quarter and expect production to ramp up through 2017. Our other oil sands assets continue to perform well and we're see ongoing ramp-up at Foster Creek Phase F despite the 11-day shutdown the end of May due to forest fires.","Alaska's average production was 174,000 BOE per day. We're continuing to make project (sic) [progress] (16:18) on our CD5 and Drill Site 2S projects, where the first wells were spudded at both projects during the quarter and both are on track for first oil during the fourth quarter.","As we mentioned in the first quarter call, we resumed exports from Kenai LNG in April. So far we've delivered two cargoes and we expect to deliver four more by the end of the year. And our seasonal turnaround activity started at both Prudhoe and Kuparuk in June and will continue into the third quarter.","Now let's review our Europe and Asia-Pacific and Middle East segments on slide 14. In Europe, second-quarter production averaged 206,000 BOE per day. We achieved startup of our Enochdhu project slightly ahead of schedule. We're also making progress on our Alder project, which is expected to come online in late 2016. Eldfisk II and Eldfisk South production is continuing to ramp up as we bring additional wells online. And we've safely completed our turnaround activity in the J-Area and the Ekofisk Area ahead of schedule. However, we still have a significant amount of turnaround activity planned in the region during the third quarter.","In the APME segment, we produced 349,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. That's an 8% increase compared the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of new production from major project startups in Malaysia. APLNG Train 1 is nearing completion. We achieved another milestone this week when we started loading refrigerants to the LNG facility and we remain on track for first cargo in the fourth quarter.","In China we completed our Bohai appraisal program with encouraging results. And in Malaysia, Gumusut began a major turnaround in June, which was just completed in the past few days.","So to wrap up my comments, the business is continuing to perform well, we're hitting our production targets, lowering our cost and maintaining our focus on safety. We have a few more major projects and turnarounds to complete this year but we're on track to deliver on our commitments.","Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan for his closing remarks.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt. And that wraps up our second-quarter review. So here's the summary: The dividend is safe, the business is running extremely well, we can achieve cash flow neutrality in 2017 and beyond at today's strip of roughly $60 per barrel Brent and we have a unique formula for sustainable performance and a portfolio that can deliver.","Now currently the environment today is challenging for the industry. But we believe we're entering a new reality for the business. The winners will be those companies with a rational vision, high quality asset base and a strong workforce and a commitment to shareholders.","The winners will be those companies who can manage short, medium and long-term goals simultaneously and we're setting plans and delivering on the things that we can control in the short term, paying close attention to the drivers of medium and long-term performance. We believe this broad perspective will serve us well and make us an even stronger company in the future.","So thank you for listening to the opening remarks and I'd be happy to turn it back over to the operator for your questions and our answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Guy Baber of Simmons and Company. Please go ahead.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much for taking my question. I had a couple. First, was just hoping to discuss the decision making progress around determining whether to increase or decrease unconventional activity levels later this year and into 2016? You mentioned the development program discretion, so just wanted to dive a bit deeper into that. I think the prior view was to begin increasing the rig count the back half of this year, but oil prices have obviously weakened and you obviously have a lot of flexibility next year with $2 billion in major projects rolling off. So could you just help us understand the framework for determining unconventional activity spending levels as we go into next year?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Guy, thanks. As we laid out in April, we saw some modest increases in the prices over the next couple of years in our path to sort of our working the medium-term in 2017. And if we see the \u2013 and in that plan we had some ramping up of our unconventional activity assumed in that plan. As our capital flexibility increased and our project capital was rolling off Surmont and APLNG, we're going to direct that to the unconventionals which are shorter cycle time, higher returns, and just better opportunities for the company.","I would say if prices that we're seeing today, sub $60 Brent, high $40s and low $50s, we don't have plans to increase the capital and ramp up in the unconventionals if these kind of prices persist. So we're watching the space pretty closely. As Matt said, we'll announce our capital later this year, but that's going to be informed by where we think the commodity prices are and where we think they will be in 2016. And that's going to then dictate how much we ramp up in the unconventionals.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks, Ryan. And then my follow up was could you just discuss a little bit more some of the assumptions implicit in the comment that you could achieve cash flow neutrality by 2017 at $60 a barrel Brent. So more specifically, could you perhaps elaborate on what deflation capture would be implicit in those assumptions? And just any more detail that you could give there I think would be helpful, as I think that's a pretty important assertion.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think what we're saying right now is that when we came out in April, we talked about the capital required to generate a flat production profile for a long period of time for the company. We thought that was about $9 billion. I think the deflation that we've seen to date and the additional deflation that would happen in a lower price world that you're describing, our flat capital goes down something closer to $8 billion and if this price were to persist for a period of time we would expect additional deflation and more efficiencies going forward. We haven't factored that into the analysis necessarily but it is a recognition that we can achieve flat production for a long period of time at an $8 billion capital level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Doug.","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Ryan, I wanted to continue on Guy's question about the downward revisions to operating capital cost and specifically you highlighted on slide five four different categories, and you just touched on deflation capture but I also wanted to see if you could comment on \u2013 or give us a little bit more insight on what you mean by discretion in development programs, deepwater reductions, program efficiencies, just a few more specifics there, if you have any?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Doug. Be happy to. So we described sort of the deflation capture and efficiency that we're seeing in the portfolio to lower the capital required to keep flat production over time, and that's clearly something that we would dial in if we saw these kinds of prices persist. We talk about \u2013 something we don't talk about is asset sales. We think in the portfolio our size we have an ongoing rationalization program that keeps eliminating the bottom end of the portfolio and that's certainly there.","We've got a lot of flexibility. The unconventionals are shorter cycle time and we can ramp those up at different speeds responding to the commodity price environment that we find ourselves in. So as we try to describe the actions, the levers and the tools, those are some of them. You mentioned the deepwater exploration. We're working through that as well but would expect that to be incremental in terms of capital savings and operating cost savings as we look forward at this kind of price level.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then finally on cash flow, when using consensus estimates, divestitures and borrowings in the quarter, it seems like your dividend is covered for 2015, and on this point I wanted to see where your after-tax borrowing costs were on the recent borrowings in the period. And then also the status of any other funding sources such as a revolver, commercial paper or whatever you deem relevant, so maybe a question for Jeff?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. Doug. As we mentioned in our brief remarks there, we were out in the debt markets in the second quarter and we issued $2.5 billion worth of debt. That was a mix of fixed and floating, and on average that was a 1.8%, 1.9% interest rate on a pre-tax basis, so you could tax effect that. So we ended the second quarter at $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet. It probably takes $800 million to $1 billion to operate our business, and then in addition to that we have about a $6 billion liquidity line that's undrawn currently.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Doug.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I guess, Ryan, first of all, thank you for your remarks at the beginning of the call of the dividend. I think that's pretty clear, but I've got a couple of questions around the strategy, how that changes in a low oil price environment. First one's really on exploration. So you've cut a rig obviously this year you had a fairly large commitment. What does this say about the exploration strategy going forward, given the resource depth that you have and given that that's a key area of discretionary spending? Are you backing away from exploration post 2015? And I've got a follow up, please.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Doug, I think I'll take that. And so the specific announcement we made earlier this month is only related to canceling the Ensco drillship. And that by itself is going to result in a decrease in our deepwater exploration capital by $300 million to $500 million a year for the next three years as a function of what the spread rate and the equity position would be. We're still going to be conducting deepwater exploration, though, through 2015 and into 2016. We have \u2013 we're appraising our existing discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa and high grading the portfolio to fulfill the remaining rig commitments that we have.","But more to the strategic question that you were asking, we are looking more broadly at our deepwater portfolio and considering alternatives to that portfolio. But anything we do is going to have to preserve value from the discoveries that we've made in the portfolio that we've built up over the last few years. So there is still a strategic question on the long-term position of deepwater.","Now we have a very strong position in the unconventionals and as you mentioned, a very strong position across the resource base as a whole. So the strategic emphasis would be moving more towards developing the existing resource base but there still is a significant role for exploration to play in bringing new resources into the portfolio. So there will be more to come in this to over time, Doug, as we firm up those longer-term strategic implications of the deepwater decision.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answer, Matt. I guess the follow up is probably for you as well, I'm guessing, because there has been, I think, you and I had some time together earlier this year. There was some talk about 80,000 barrels a day of potential non-core production. With your comments about, one has to imagine that there is disposal potential in some of your existing undeveloped discoveries, how should we think about the scale of what you envisage to be your disposal backlog, if that's the right way to ask the question? And how would that capital be redeployed? Would it buy back stock? Would it shore up on the balance sheet? How would you use the spending? And then I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. So, as Jeff and Ryan both mentioned, we expect to be some form of dispositions going on sort of continuously in the portfolio just to trim up. And it is nonstrategic. So for example, you may have seen yesterday or the day before that we are going to market our Cook Inlet position in Alaska. I think it's quite well known that we've had a package out there in Canada for nonstrategic assets and big gas assets, and we have some assets in the lower 48 that fit the same criteria. So we do have some tactical dispositions that we're currently marketing at the moment. So, I mean, the use of that cash would be to fund our dividend and our ongoing capital programs of the...","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I'd jump in there, Doug, a little bit. The priorities are the dividend to the shareholder, the balance sheet, and then a growth we can afford.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Paul.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","You talked about 2017 cash flow neutrality and an $8 billion hold for that number. Are you implying that you are actually going to outspend cash flow between now and then? Or are you essentially going as fast as you can to get to cash flow neutrality?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it largely, Paul, depends on our outlook on the commodity prices, which we're watching pretty closely right now. But we would have some slight outspend in 2016 if we continue to ramp up and hold the capital at $11.5 billion, but that's something that we're looking at dropping down at the current price and continuing to exercise the flexibility.","What people tend to forget about though, starting in 2016 and going into 2017, is we have pretty significant ramp in production from Surmont Phase 2 and from APLNG. And that's capital and cost that we spent the last four years to five years. We've got production coming on in 2016 and 2017 that people tend to forget about that is right in front of us. Surmont 2 just first steam earlier this year, we'll have first oil here imminently. And first cargo is coming out of APLNG. So the intention is to get to cash flow neutrality as quick as we can. And we're just trying to demonstrate that we've got a lot of flexibility, even at the current lower prices we're seeing today.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, I understand. And I probably should have prefaced it by saying if we assume the strip, which I guess is something around what you're talking about here, is sort of a $60 outlook is what we see on the futures market?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and that's why we've tried to put that into our slide at that kind of a price level just to give you some sense of how we would manage the business at that kind of a deck.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And I think you've been asked this and you've tried to answer it. Forgive me if I just slightly missed what was being said. But can you just run over again the deflation element here, the lower service costs here? I know you've done some excellent work in your presentation showing how costs are changing. When I was with Mr. Hirshberg, he said that this is actually lagging, this is last year's data. Would you mind just going back over how we get from an $11.5 billion, $11 billion run rate this year all the way down as low as $8 billion, seemingly simply if oil stays at $60?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Doug (sic) [Paul] (32:40). So in April we talked about deflation, the $700 million that we were trying to capture. We now see that probably closer to $900 million. And obviously if the kind the strip prices that you're talking about persist, we'd expect that to continue down as well. So as we look out at that, the $8 billion is really to stay flat. The $9 billion or the $10 billion or $11.5 billion grows our production based on the amounts that we laid out in April.","So we've got a lot of flexibility between the $11.5 billion that we laid out to the marketplace in April versus this what we're calling $8 billion just to stay flat production. So what we're trying to describe to folks is, with the capital flexibility, the deflation and the efficiencies that we're creating in the business is just adding to the flexibility on the capital side of the program. It gives us a lot of choice as we go into the back half of this year in deciding what kind of program we want to execute in 2016 and 2017 on our pathway to get to cash flow neutrality as quickly as we can.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great, Ryan. Thanks. And if I could just add in, we've had the idea that you would IPO the exploration business and have it as a standalone business. I assume you'd want to retain some access to that business as opposed to, for example, disposing of it all together but at the moment it feels like the potential for you to spin in (34:10) that business is going to be undervaluing it essentially.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's right. We're looking at all the alternatives right now, Paul, about that business. And we'll have more to come on that as we progress later in the year and into next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe one more follow up on the cost issues. The incremental $300 million hit to OpEx that we saw on this, again, were you saying was that just incremental capital deflation? Is this more of an issue of pace? Or to be clear, are you trending towards much larger levels of cost reductions on a two-year basis than you had expected earlier?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I can take that one, Ryan. Yes, we're definitely running ahead of schedule on where we thought we're going to be on reducing cost. And as we mentioned, it's a combination of deflation in the business, some minor amount of FX benefits, but it's really mostly related to us figuring out ways that we can drive costs out of our business. So we talked in terms of having this $1 billion cost reduction target. We're feeling really good about our ability to achieve that or go beyond that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe on, at APLNG, you talked about hopefully a cargo during the fourth quarter. Can you maybe talk about what are the remaining steps that you have to achieve there at APLNG between now and the fourth quarter to get that first cargo?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, so we're at the stage where we're beginning to load refrigerants. We have go \u2013 a process we've got, that's cold, turn the (36:10) mechanical runs, getting all the equipment (36:12) so the compressors are running and everything's running well. And that whole process of that sort of integrated completion and then hook-up, commissioning of the plant is all in hand and the gas is there on the upstream side to feed the plant. So we're feeling good about the ability to get the initial cargo sometime in the fourth quarter.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Folks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm sorry, I'm going to go back on cost structure as well. I'm just curious about maybe the sustainability of some of the cost deflation that you're witnessing. Obviously industry in general sees costs coming down, but I'm just curious what steps are being taken to ensure that these are more structural so that they don't simply re-inflate once the commodity finally does recover.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Blake, we're taking a pretty hard look top to bottom in terms of how we run the company and we're considering where we came from as an integrated company and the size, scale and capability we have as that company and looking at taking the opportunity now to a bit right-size relative to how an independent company like ConocoPhillips finds itself today.","So there's things that we do in our company that were a remnant of the integrated company in terms of how much functional expertise to have in the center, how much oversight versus that accountability that goes out to the B (37:50). We've done a pretty good job of building that model on our lower 48 unconventional business. We're going to extend that across the whole company with less of a one-size-fits-all and more of a fit-for-purpose design, recognizing that an asset in the lower 48 is different than an asset in the North Sea or up in Alaska or offshore Australia.","So really, our employees get it, they understand it, they understand where we're seeing. And we're already seeing the benefits of that shift. We've been working on that over the last two to three years as we've tried to build the culture of an independent company. Now certainly with the downturn it just puts more of a laser focus on the need to accelerate that, and to make it more prominent throughout the whole organization and the whole company, and then I think that will make it much more sustainable.","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan. The follow up is on the strategic shift toward shorter cycle type of projects. I guess when I think of Deepwater, definitely longer-term, highly capital-intensive, but they do tend to contribute fairly well to earnings. And when I look at the lower 48 contribution for earnings it seems to be one of the areas that's the weakest. As you kind of shift more toward these shorter cycle projects, do you anticipate that to have a negative impact on your actual earnings profile? Or is that a concern?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you can \u2013 I'll take that one. When you look at lower 48 earnings, currently a driving factor there is really the level of depreciation that's being charged currently as we develop the unconventionals. And we're probably having depreciation charges which are a third larger than they'll be longer-term because of the reserve booking schedule and kind of the relative conservatism that's forced upon us as we book according to the rules that are out there. So as we go through time you're going to see depreciation rates come down in the lower 48 and that's going to have a significant improvement in the earnings from that segment.","The other thing of course as you've heard us talk about, and you've heard the industry talk about, is just the cost levels that it's taking to develop reserves in the unconventionals have come down dramatically, and that will reflect itself in lower depreciation rates as well going forward over time. So yeah, where you do have fairly weak earnings coming out of our lower 48 segment over time you will see \u2013 currently, you will see those improve as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Two very quick questions on the $60 breakeven again. Sorry, that would be what 2017 production, the same that you have laid out in the past or are you changing that production growth?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. It's the same, Ed.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great.","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, as Ryan mentioned, a lot of the production growth is coming from things that we've already invested in.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Okay. And then presumably even on that stay flat there would still be some positive cash margin shifts as you still back out some of the older gas production that's still in that mix as you get out to 2017 even on flat CapEx?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, absolutely. So when you look at the Canadian \u2013 the Surmont 2 addition and the APLNG that's coming on at a higher margin than a large part of our portfolio with the North American gas piece that you described, Ed.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then...","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We always talk about margins in terms of kind of flat price cash margins. One of the things we are seeing as we talked about it as well, is costs are coming out of the business as well which improve margins across the board.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","So it's kind of dividend, plus a little bit? And then just on APLNG, I mean, obviously, everyone's observed that the Asia LNG market has suddenly faced a sort of dramatic drop in demand and there's obviously a lot of cargos coming on to compete for that gas demand. I mean, clearly first cargo is an important milestone and the CapEx will fall for the project, and therefore the cash contribution from the APLNG associates will improve which we'll see next year. But can you talk a little bit about how you are placing that product into the market for train one and train two given weak demand?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, right now we're working through that, Ed. And I know there has been a lot of speculation in the marketplace around the contract, and the SPA that we have with the buyers. We have two buyers, we have a Japanese buyer for train two. And train one is going to China to Sinopec. And we have an SPA, we have a contract with them. They've got diversionary rights within China and with our approval which we have provided, they've got diversionary rights outside of China as well. And we're working with them to understand the volume that they can take into the country in 2016 and as we go forward into 2017 and I'd just remind people that our contract is a take-or-pay contract and we expect they're going to live to the terms of that contract.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Maybe just several quick questions. The first one is probably for Jeff. Jeff, on the second quarter, what is your cost saving run rate and what do you expect those run rate are going to look like in the third and the fourth quarter?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not sure how to interpret your question, Paul. So when you say cost savings, I mean, are...?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. I mean that you have a program there to reduce costs, and I'm trying to understand how much of that cost savings is already reflected in your second quarter result and what is the incremental improvement we could expect in the remainder of the year into next year?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So when we \u2013 I'll take you back to the analyst presentation. When we talked about 2014 cost levels of $9.7 billion and we were going to take that down to $8.7 billion, that was the $1 billion we were taking out, and we said we thought we'd get halfway there in 2015. So we gave cost guidance of $9.2 billion. So we're well along that path is what we're pointing out today and we actually revised that $9.2 billion down to $8.9 billion. So we're going to continue to see that as we go through the year, and you can see that we've had some pretty low cost levels in the first part of the year. The difficulty I have with your question is there is variability from quarter to quarter as we go through the year, but if you look at the whole year, we're running well ahead of where we thought we were going to be for the year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you have a number that you can share? In the second quarter what is the cash operating cost?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well as \u2013 well, you can look at our \u2013 at our...","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Paul, it's in the supplemental.","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...balance sheet, it was $2.1 billion essentially in what we call cash operating cost, which is production cost...","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Operating.","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...G&A cost and the G&A associated with exploration was $2.1 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","$2.1 billion, so annualized it is $8.4 billion, but you talk about...","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. That...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...the full year is $8.9 billion?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so again, that's why I point out that we have seasonality in our costs related to turnaround activities and we'll have some costs that'll increase as we go through the year and as production ramps up in some of the new projects.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And maybe the second question is for Ryan. Ryan, I presume that now you have reset this year the CapEx at $11 billion, so that the next several years the base case is $11 billion also. Under what commodity price \u2013 let's assume that if the commodity price stays where we are, what is the CapEx going to look like? Is it going to stick at the $11 billion end up that you're going to reduce it? I'm trying to understand that, what's the criteria you're going to go for? Are you trying to \u2013 because clearly you're not going to reach the cash flow neutral mark (46:05) this year, so what kind of criteria we should be looking at that would set your CapEx program?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I said, Paul, we'll try to \u2013 we'll set a capital budget later in the year as we look at what the commodity price and what we can afford. When we laid out a plan at $11.5 billion, that assumed some slight modest recovery in prices. If we see prices aren't recovering and they remain at kind of today's level going forward into 2016, you shouldn't expect us to be spending the $11 billion, $11.5 billion, $11.5 billion we laid out in April or the $11 billion that we're talking about today. So no. We're going to manage the whole system to make sure we reach cash flow neutrality. We're doing the right things to grow the business and fund the maintenance capital but you should expect it to become lower. And we'll provide more clarity around that as we go through the course of the year and we watch where commodity prices end up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Roger.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess maybe to get back to some of the internal cost cutting and the commentary about structuring the company more like an E&P as opposed to a large integrated, and then given where you are on the operating cost savings, what more should we expect to see from a streamlining or the head count reductions, that sort of structure?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as Jeff said, we're well on our way to the $1 billion cost challenge. We think we're certainly going to hit that, probably exceed that. The exploration decision that we made and announced earlier, as I said, that's going to be incremental both on a capital and an operating cost side. Will have some impact on the organization as we think about that going forward, so we think there's running room beyond where we're at, but it's something that we're spending a lot of time looking at.","And with respect to re-looking at how we run the company, that's going to deliver sustainable reductions for the longer term. So it's not just about taking $1 billion or more out of the cost system in the short (48:35) deflation, it is about making that a sustainable cut over time, and that's where our focus is at right now.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then for Jeff, looking at the cash flow statement or the cash flow waterfall, working capital was a negative to this point. As you think about latter part of this year or 2016, is there a \u2013 an opportunity to pull out of working capital as well as cash flow from the business, as well as potentially more debt? What are some of the things we should think about maybe as some of these large projects start to come online, as to whether they consume or free up capital, in addition to the CapEx changes?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think from a working capital perspective, what we've seen in the first half of the year is really just the effect of a couple of things is, accounts payable coming down because of the lower activities on the capital side. This is really the \u2013 as we've moved our capital program down from the $16 billion, $17 billion kind of level last year to this $11 billion this year, you've got this lag effect on working capital. Now that we're kind of down at the level that we're going to be at on capital, we wouldn't expect that effect to continue in subsequent quarters. And then as prices come down, you've seen changes in, kind of, our taxes payable as well come off and be a use of cash from a working capital perspective. That's pretty well out of the system now also. So we wouldn't anticipate that being a significant change in use of cash going forward for us.","As I mentioned on the call, we still have really solid access to the capital markets to the extent that we \u2013 that it's necessary to go beyond our cash balances to fund our capital and our dividend in the period before 2016 when we get to cash flow neutrality. We certainly have the ability to do that in a very effective way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Hey, Evan.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, maybe my question's related to the U.S. earnings power comment and offshore exploration reduction. Maybe for Matt, I mean, I know you look at resource upstream globally and the savings and efficiencies onshore, U.S. unconventional have been most notable to date. I mean, do you see the scope for international to significantly move down the cost curve to compete for greenfield capital? Or in this strip environment, do you see the U.S. and your U.S. unconventional position as economically superior and effectively taking market share?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","So does that mean \u2013 I'm thinking from a deflation perspective, more than half of the deflation that we've seen has been in North America so far. And historically, the international business has been slower to respond from an unconventional \u2013 from a deflation perspective, so we still expect to see more of that come in over the next months and into 2016 on the international side. And as we see this emerge, then we can understand what implications it has for capital costs, and then that has implications for the viability of projects across the portfolio as a whole, so that they \u2013 what we're seeing emerge from a deflation perspective, will influence how we think about capital allocation in the years ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, and efficiencies here as well. I mean, at current strip pricing, what's the break-even period on one of your $8 million to $9 million Eagle Ford wells? Is that \u2013 are we a little over a year? What's...","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think we're still in the 12-month to 18-month sort of level to get \u2013 for break-even on an individual well.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's pretty powerful. If I could slip in just one other \u2013 if, just a question on the \u2013 if you can discuss it, the changes to working capital associated with investing activities in the quarter. That was sequentially higher. What drove that reclassification, the working capital change from investing activity?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think you're noticing that on the cash flow statement this time we broke working capital out from related to operating activities and investing activities. We did that to provide more clarity on what was really driving the changes in working capital. And, again, as I mentioned a couple times now, the real driver has been just the slowdown in the capital investing activities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, everyone. Jeff, I think you noted a few times about the bond offerings in the quarter. But I think I'm right in saying that you saw a negative credit watch. So I kind of was wondering where those discussions sit in the current environment with the various rating agencies and how vociferously you would feel you'd need to defend a single A rating?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So where we're currently rated is A1 with Moody's, which is the highest single A. And we're at a middle single A with Standard & Poor's and Fitch. And all of them, as you mentioned, have us on a negative outlook. All three of the agencies confirmed our rating in conjunction with the $2.5 billion bond offering that we did in the second quarter. So I think the position that they're in is they're waiting to see how commodity prices play out and what levels of incremental borrowing we might do before we get to cash flow neutrality in 2017.","But as we said before, as we look at different scenarios of what borrowings we might do and before we get to neutrality in 2017, we're still very comfortable that level of borrowing is not going to take us out of the single A range. It could knock us down a notch within that range, but it wouldn't take us out of that range.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And defending single A would be paramount, would it?","Jeff W. Sheets - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we think that's the right place for a company like ours to be. It just fits strategically with the direction we're heading as a company to be one that has a priority on shareholder distributions, like we've talked about with the dividend, that is pursuing modest growth and wants to have the capability to do that through all kinds of different commodity price cycles. So we do feel like that's the appropriate credit space for us to be in.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Thank you. With the Cook Inlet sale, does that include the Kenai plant?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","No, it doesn't.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Matt. Next one. You talked a lot obviously about efficiencies and cost savings and optimizations and deflation, all that. You're a big company, as Ryan talked about earlier. You have the ability technically to run your fields differently than, say, smaller companies. So how much of your overall performance is related to that type of self-help from, say, field automatization so you can minimize unplanned downtime and enhance recoveries?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","So, it's just part of our cost reduction process. We are looking at our operating costs, our lifting costs across the company as a whole. And we've for years have had a very strong operations excellence program that we've applied across the organization. Frankly, for the past few years, we've been focusing that on increasing production. That's what you do when oil prices are $100 a barrel.","But the same, the tools exist within that capability to focus that more on cost reduction. So we are refocusing our operations excellence on making sure that we're getting the right balance of the right operating efficiency and the right costs in this price environment. So having that capability and that sort of integrated view across the whole organization is really good.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I would add, John, to that that as we talk about the independents, some of the capability we have as a company, our functional excellence around integrated operation centers and the ops excellence plans that Matt talked about, the reservoir understanding and characterization, the EUR, the stimulated rock volume work that we're doing, we're going to maintain that and expand that capability because we think it's differential in leveraging in the independent world.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much. I had another question on long-cycle time versus short-cycle time investments and you're clearly at a point where you're hitting an inflection point and capital is dropping away and production ramp is coming in. But I suppose long-cycle time by definition means that if you're not investing today, then you don't have those big step changes in production in, let's say, the 2019, 2020 timeframe.","So my question is two-fold. First of all, do you expect to move towards FID on any major capital projects this year and next year, just given the capital-constrained environment? And then the second part of the question is, over the cycle, how much CapEx above the $8 billion of maintenance CapEx would you want to be putting into these longer-cycle time projects relative to your short-cycle time investment opportunities?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","On the FID question, we will be making final investment decisions on a few relatively small projects as we go through this year and into next year. We're in a fortunate position that most of our major projects that are in the portfolio now are not mega projects and they're projects that we've executed before, like adding drill sites in Alaska or adding platforms in the North Sea or in China, so that they're all relatively small-scale things. So we do have the scope within the capital program to continue to invest in those longer-cycle but smaller-scale projects. And we will do that.","One of the strategic questions which I think is what you're getting at, Jason, is for the long term what is the right balance for a company like us between the more flexible short-cycle investment opportunities, of which we have a lot within our development programs in particular in unconventional business, and then these longer-cycle projects of the characteristics I just spoke about. And that, we have flexibility to, we have to decide exactly what that ratio should be and that's one of the lenses that we look at our strategy through.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Neil.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Hey, Neil.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that incremental disclosure on cash flow neutrality in 2017. Definitely been top of mind for investors. Two more industry-focused questions. I guess the first one, Ryan, Speaker Boehner yesterday came out in favor of crude exports. Senate, I think as we speak, is at least discussing it. Flipside is, we're going into an election year, just want to get your thoughts on the latest temperature on this issue as you've really been leading the charge on behalf of the industry?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Neil. No, it was \u2013 we're glad to see. We've been working with the Speaker's office to get them to support the repeal of the ban and get it up for a vote later this year, and I think we made some significant progress, both in the House and the Senate. And of course the Speaker's comments yesterday were well received by the industry and everybody. I still would \u2013 it's still going to be a little bit of a tough uphill climb. There's \u2013 we're getting bipartisan support, both in the House and the Senate. We could use a little bit more of the democratic support for it, so we're working on that.","But what chances do I give it of passing this year? We \u2013 I haven't climbed to 50%, but it's encouraging to see that we may get a vote, at least an up\/down vote in at least one of the chambers to go forward. I think the question everybody's asking is, is there enough bipartisan support to clear both houses, and then to clear the administration, and that's what we're spending most of our time on right now.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Ryan. And then the second question is views on industry consolidation. This is less a Conoco-specific point, but more an industry point. If you expect an acceleration in activity with the double dip in the commodity and the capital markets tightening, less so as you guys pointed out for yourselves, but for companies less attractively positioned from a capital structure than you, your thoughts on M&A going forward for the industry?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, if we saw some modest increasing in the commodity prices, maybe that we would have envisioned a little bit more earlier in the year, I'd have told you that I think the stocks are pretty fully valued and I am expecting prices to come back to that $70, mid-$70, $80 kind of level. Certainly with this re-correction over the last few months, it's putting a spotlight on some of the companies, as you say, that may not have the financial capacity that ConocoPhillips does. So if these lower prices persist for a longer period of time, that's certainly an area that probably would start to ramp up. I still don't personally believe the floodgates are opening on that, but I think it's something that industry will be watching pretty closely if these kinds of prices persist for a longer period of time.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to be very crystal-clear on one point. Obviously you guys had highlighted a 2014 to 2016 operating cost to go back to that issue \u2013 reduction of $1 billion of which you'd said about 70% was supposed to be, roughly 70% was supposed to be structural savings. Am I right in thinking that that was really before you guys had envisioned a strategic review of the kind that has been talked about a couple times regarding streamlining some of your, let's call, the major-like execution capacities? Which would \u2013 is it right to think of those as incremental, potential incremental structural cost savings outside of that original first $1 billion?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, no, James. When we laid out the $1 billion we kind of had a vision that we were going to go through this process and make some structural changes to the company. So I would say that some, not all, but many of those structural changes are built into the $1 billion trajectory that we're on. As Jeff described, I think we're ahead of plan and our expectation is that we'll generate more savings beyond the $1 billion.","And then the exploration decision that we made not to pursue, continue pursuing some of the deepwater, that is incremental to the $1 billion decision, and we're working through what the implications of that given that we have some portfolio and discovered portfolio that we're going to continue to invest in or monetize in other ways.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. That makes sense. So down-shifting in that way would be the incremental piece. Okay. Just a separate thing kind of following up on the quarterly discussion regarding long, short cycle. But \u2013 and correct me if there has been a change in this \u2013 but looking at AKLNG. As I understood it, there was a potential for that to proceed to pre-FEED in 2016 or at least graduate to the next step in the development process, which would probably require a material capital contribution from stakeholders. Maybe that's getting pushed to the right, but could you describe your thinking on that project? Your participation in it? And how it fits into your portfolio given that obviously we're trying to skew toward shorter cycle projects at the moment?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we are making some progress on that with the partners in alliance with the state. There's still a lot of work to do to get an aligned view around the fiscals and state's participation, and what that's going to look like. So there's a lot of work to go do even before we take that next step that you described into pre-FEED. I think the companies are looking at the kind of end of this year, into 2016 to make that decision. But a lot of that is dependent on kind of how we see the alignment working with the State of Alaska and their participation in the project.","It's a very, very long project. No resource risk for us. So it kind of goes back to Matt's comment as how much of this long, longer cycle time, but very flat production with very low resource risk do you want in the portfolio. And we're going through those thoughts and analysis right now. It doesn't mean that there's zero of that in the portfolio. I think a healthy portfolio has some of that. We've got some LNG properties, we've got our Qatar property, we've got APLNG coming online. We have a large resource potential in the oil sands, we're trying to figure out how to break those projects into shorter cycle time projects. But still are long dated resources barrels that are attractive and should be a part of the portfolio. So that's going to be the challenge for us as we think about AKLNG going forward.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. All right. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, James.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, James.","Operator","Thank you.

Lance","Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Let me kick off the meeting today with a review of our key 2012 highlights and accomplishments. And certainly the strategic highlight of the year was the spin-off our downstream business, Phillips 66, which occurred in May. And following that transaction, we emerged as North America\u2019s largest independent E&P Company. And we set out to combine our world-class assets, technology, financial strength and workforce with an intense focus on the E&P business. We laid out an ambitious goal to achieve both growth and returns, while offering a compelling dividend and we remain committed to that goal.","Achieving this goal depends not only on executing or identified growth programs, but on executing a major divestiture program to high-grade asset base. And during 2012, we made significant progress on this program. We completed asset sales of $2.1 billion and recently announced agreements for an additional $9.6 billion of dispositions. These proceeds will give us the flexibility to fund our significant growth programs over the next few years.","And a key part of our ongoing value proposition is to maintain a focus on our shareholders. We achieved strong shareholder returns during 2012, especially combining the performance of ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. That strategic performance was matched with strong operational results. We met our volume targets in 2012 achieving a total annual production rate of 1.578 million BOE per day with growth on a continuing operations basis, and we are on track to deliver the plans we laid out in April of last year.","We recognize that 2013 would be a low point in production and we expect growth in the fourth quarter due to major project start-ups and continued ramp up in our North American drilling programs. And this sets us up for our long-term 3% to 5% growth objective. We grow our reserve base to 8.6 billion BOEs and organic conditions this year were 942 million BOE, and that represents a 150% reserve replacement rate, a significant achievement for a company our size.","Throughout the year, the business ran well, our major projects and drilling programs performed as expected, and importantly we built momentum in both our conventional and unconventional exploration programs and these are key to creating long-term value in this business.","For the full-year, we generated $6.7 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.37 per share from continuing operations, and we generated $14.7 billion in cash from continuing operations excluding working capital. We returned over $8 billion to our shareholders; $5.1 billion of share repurchases and $3.3 billion in ordinary dividends. Our per share performance for the year reflects roughly a 10% reduction in share count compared to 2011.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, let me take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and the dedication of our ConocoPhillips workforce. Despite the year of major change, they maintained their focus on the business and they delivered on all fronts and I\u2019m very proud of their performance and their commitment to our strong start as an independent company.","So I\u2019ll come back with some concluding remarks. So let me now turn it over to Jeff for the financial review.","Jeff Sheets","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with a review of our fourth quarter financial results on slide four. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.76 billion or $1.43 a share for the fourth quarter 2012. The special items this quarter that we excluded from our reported earnings from an Asian adjusted earnings included some asset impairments, certain tax items, and legal settlements, as well as adjustments for discontinued operations. These adjustments totaled $329 million, and the details can be found in the supplemental data that we provided with the earnings release.","As a result of the announced agreements to sell our interest in the Kashagan Field and the Algeria and Nigeria business units, we accreted earnings and production associated with these assets as discontinued operations for the current quarter, as well as previous quarters.","Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter from these assets would have been $27 million during the quarter, or $0.02 a share, and our adjusted earnings per share would have been $1.45 without this change.","The earnings chart and realized price data on this slide now reflect continuing operations for all the periods and except where we specifically noted, this is going to be our convention as we go through today\u2019s call. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings were down by 14%, primarily due to lower liquids prices, higher DD&A expense, which was offset primarily by higher volumes.","Our per share earnings in this year\u2019s fourth quarter benefited from a 7% reduction in share count compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Compared to the third quarter, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were up 3% due to higher volumes and a slight improvement in realized prices.","Production volumes for the quarter met our targets. We achieved solid performance across most of the portfolio and resumed production in several segments following the third quarter plant maintenance.","The year-over-year average realized prices for the quarter were down about $3 a barrel, but up about $1 in the third quarter compared to fourth quarter. Our bitumen and NGL prices declined during the year and remained weak. In the fourth quarter, bitumen represented about 7% of our production in North American NGL has also represented about 7% of world wide production.","Clearly, it\u2019s been a significant amount of volatility and price markers through the year. But if you look across our overall portfolio, realizations were relatively stable. Finally, operating cost came in about as we expected them for the year.","Now turn to slide 5 and I\u2019ll review fourth quarter production performance. This waterfall takes you through the changes in production from the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the current quarter. You can see the split here, production from continuing operations and from discontinued operations, and I\u2019ll step through the key items here, and Matt is going to provide some additional details in his material.","Total production from continuing and discontinuing operations was 1.607 million BOE per day in this year\u2019s fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectation. So starting at the left of the chart, stepping through the waterfall, dispositions reduced production by 55,000 BOE per day compared to the fourth quarter last year. And those 2012 dispositions included Vietnam, the Statjford and Alba fields in the North Sea, some Western Canadian assets and NMG, a joint venture in Russia.","Downtime accounted for 40,000 BOE per day of lower production compared to the downtime experienced in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. And the downtime primarily occurred in Nigeria, the UK, and some in the Lower 48. Natural field declines were about 152,000 BOE per day. And finally shown in the green wedge on the chart is growth wedge of 257,000 BOE per day, an incremental production compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","The largest component of this growth wedge is new production from our Lower 48, Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, and new production from our Canadian oil sands developments. Improved drilling programs and performance across our portfolio, the resumption of full production in Libya and some incremental volumes from the Peng Lai field in China also contributed to the growth in production.","On a continuing operations basis, production for this year\u2019s fourth quarter was 1.566 million BOE per day compared to 1.483 million BOE per day in last year\u2019s fourth quarter when you adjust that quarter for dispositions. So this represents a 6% growth overall. And additionally, liquids as a percent of our portfolio from continuing operation increased between the two periods.","So if you turn to slide 6, we\u2019ll cover some production guidance for 2013. On the left of this chart is our 2011 total production of 1.578 million BOE per day. I want to take you to some of the adjustments that will result in a normalized 2012 production number reflecting production from only the assets that we expect to be in our portfolio for the entirety of 2013.","First, we back out the 51,000 BOEs per today to discontinued operations, which again is the assets in Algeria and Nigeria. Next, we removed 70,000 BOE everyday which is the 2012 production generated by the dispositions that were closed during 2012. And earlier this month, we also announced the sale of our Cedar Creek Anticline assets, which we expect to close late in the first quarter 2013. So our analysis we back out our final 13,000 BOE per day, which represents production from this asset during 2012.","So the resulting 2012 production of 1.497 million BOE per day represents the normalized year of the production performance of our go forward assets. So our 2013 outlook for production from these assets that will remain in our portfolio is a range of 1.475 million BOE to 1.525 million BOE per day.","On the first quarter, we expect to still have Algeria, Nigeria, and Cedar Creek in our portfolio. Therefore, we provided you with the all in first quarter production outlook of 1.582 million BOE to 1.6 million BOE per day, which includes about 40,000per day for discontinued operations.","The second and third quarters of 2013 will be negatively impacted by both normal seasonality and planned maintenance. But additionally, with some new projects coming on later in the year, we\u2019ll have downtime associated with projects high-end. And then we expect fourth quarter 2013 production to return to levels near the first quarter total production, as new projects coming online make-up for the removal of production from discontinued operations. And this is consistent with the prior guidance that we given around hitting our production low point in the second or third quarter of 2013.","Now I\u2019ll turn to the segment slides and begin with the Lower 48 and Latin America, which is on slide 7. Production in this segment was 475,000 BOE per day this quarter, an increase of a prior period as we continue to ramp up production in our Lower 48 shale plays. Segment production increased 13,000 BOE per day or 3% sequentially and 31,000 or 7% compared to the same period a year ago. More importantly, liquids production grew 20% versus the fourth quarter 2011.","We reached a significant milestone during the quarter in the Eagle Ford. Production exceeded a 100,000 BOE per day on a peak daily basis and averaged 89,000 BOE per day. In addition to the Eagle Ford, the year-over-year growth was achieved from unconventional drilling in the Bakken, new wells in the Permian, and improved well performance and optimization in the San Juan basin.","While natural gas prices have recovered to levels closer to those in the fourth quarter of 2011, the weakness in crude and NGL prices drove earnings lower year-over-year and fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $157 million.","Next, we move to the Canada segment on slide 8. In the Canada segment during the fourth quarter, production was 281,000 BOE per day, up 1% sequentially. And production was up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and this reflects five consecutive quarters of growth from our oil sands assets.","Compared to the fourth quarter 2011, liquids in this segment increased 23% and natural gas production declined 7%. And overall, the portfolio mix shifted to 51% liquids from 44% liquids a year ago. This segment generated positive earnings of $32 million during the fourth quarter. Earnings benefited from both higher production and the stronger natural gas prices and these factors more than offset the impact of lower bitumen prices when compared to the third quarter. Weaker bitumen prices were the key driver and lower year-over-year earnings. We expect bitumen prices to remain weak for another quarter or so, until additional heavy refining capacity comes on line.","So now, let\u2019s move to the Alaska segment on slide 9. Production in Alaska was 222,000 BOE per day, up 46,000 compared to the third quarter. And this increase was primarily due to production coming back online, following the completion of major turnarounds in the third quarter.","Production volumes were down about 6% from the fourth quarter of 2011 to 2012, primarily on just due to normal field decline. Sequentially, higher production resulted in a higher sales volume and this earnings benefit was partially offset by higher production related cost, including our petroleum production taxes and DD&A.","Segment adjusted earnings for the quarter were $595 million. So for segments like Alaska, that are subject to lift timing differences between sales and production in any given quarter, we\u2019ve now added a red line on these charts, which represent quarterly sales compared to quarterly production. So this should help illustrate of these timing differences. All these timing differences net out over time that do create quarterly earnings volatility. So in this quarter, there was virtually no impact, no timing impact for lift timing in Alaska, but prior quarters have been impacted.","So, for example, if you look back in the fourth quarter of 2011, sales were nearly 40,000 BOE per day less than production, which result in lower earnings relative to the production level, and then we have the opposite effect in the third quarter of 2012, when sales exceeded production and that contributed positive to earnings.","I\u2019ll turn now to slide 10 and talk about the Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment. Asia-Pacific and Middle East continue to perform well during the quarter providing important diversification to our portfolio. Production in the segment was 322,000 BOE per day, up 16,000 per day, or 5% sequentially and up 32,000, or 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","The increase was primarily due to the resumption of Peng Lai production, where we also had new production for Gumusut project in Malaysia and Panyu growth project in China. As you can see from the production chart, production exceeded sales this quarter. This impacted segment earnings as earnings reflect sales volumes rather than production. We should also see a positive impact for the first quarter 2013 earnings from the reversely timing affects all other things being equal.","Sequentially and year-over-year, earnings reflect the impact of lower realized LNG prices, which are linked to the Japanese Crude Cocktail or JCC prices. And these prices impact were partially offset by the benefits of higher sales volumes.","Europe is the next segment and on slide 11. Production from the Europe segment was 216,000 BOE per day, an increase of 25,000. This increase primarily reflects the resumption of production following planned downtime at Aquitaine C Block during the third quarter. This quarter\u2019s volumes were negatively impacted by unusually high unplanned downtime in the Southern North Sea and the East Irish Sea during the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of a year ago, production declined due to normal field decline, unplanned downtime and dispositions. Sequentially, adjusted earnings of $388 million benefited from improved sales volumes and continued strong pricing in the segment.","As a reminder, like the Asia Pacific segment, this segment provides important pricing diversification in our portfolio and future earnings should benefit significantly from major project start ups that are underway. These projects will mitigate declines and bring attractive margins with the growth.","And I\u2019ll cover our final geographic segment, the other international segment on slide 12. This segment is presented on a continuing operations basis, so it excludes Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria which were previously reported in this segment. So the assets that are now in this segment includes Libya, Russia and our activities in Angola.","Fourth quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 50,000 BOE per day, up 26,000 for the same period last year and this increase was driven primarily by Libya coming back on line which more than offset the impact on NMG divestiture.","Final reporting segment I\u2019ll cover is corporate and other which is on slide 13. Adjusted corporate expense during this year\u2019s fourth quarter was $177 million resulting in a full year adjusted corporate expense of $813 million. The full year performance was a little better than our expectations.","As you recall from our update last quarter, the third quarter benefited from licensing revenue as well as some favorable FX impacts. During the fourth quarter, we issued $2 billion of debt at attractive interest rates and we used the proceeds from dispositions to pay down commercial paper and other maturing debt.","So if you turn to slide 14, I\u2019ll cover our operating segment margins and returns. The previous charts have discussed segment results on a quarterly basis and on this slide we show annual results for some key financial metrics.","Adjusted earnings declined from $8 billion in 2011 to $6.7 billion in 2012, primarily result of lower prices, particularly for North American natural gas and NGLs and Canadian bitumen. And also, we are impacted by lower production levels, which were primarily result of our ongoing asset sales program. On a per share basis adjusted earnings declined to a lesser extent from $5.75 to $5.37, as a result of a lower share count due to the $5 million of shares repurchased in 2012.","Our return on capital employed or ROCE numbers trended lower along with adjusted earnings and capital employed growing slightly from 2011 to 2012 as we are making significant investments to generate future production and margin growth.","Cash contribution for BOE and income for BOE were also impacted primarily by changes in commodity prices, and we expect to see these cash contributions per BOE numbers to grow significantly over the next several years as we add production from assets with higher cash margins in the average of our current portfolio.","And next, I\u2019ll step through the company\u2019s 2012 cash flow on slide 15. So just a quick comment about this waterfall that\u2019s shown is just Algeria, Nigeria and Kashagan were part of continuing operations to provide some better comparability to analyst cash flows and our CapEx guidance. On this basis, we generated cash from operations to $15.2 billion, excluding working capital changes in 2012, which were a $1.3 billion use of cash. We also generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from asset disposition.","We funded a $15.7 billion capital program and about $800 million of that was capital associated with Nigeria, Algeria, and Kashagan. The $5.5 billion shore show in the waterfall is discontinued operations related to the spin-up of Phillips 66, which includes the special distribution and all the other cash flows related to Phillips 66.","Moving to the right on the waterfall, we repurchased 5.1 billion of our shares and paid $3.3 billion in dividend, so over $8 billion in total distribution to shareholders in 2012. Debt and other of $600 million include some deposits we received from our recently announced asset disposition.","So summing across, we ended up 2012 with $4.4 billion of cash and restricted cash. And also just to note on the slide on the upper right, inside the box, our year-end debt was $21.7 billion, which represents a debt-to-capital of 31%.","So that concludes the review of the financial results and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt now for an update on our operations.","Matt Fox","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin the operation section with the company\u2019s 2012 reserve replacement performance. We ended 2012 with just over 8.6 billion BOE of reserves, up 3% overall compared to 2011. Importantly, we added 942 million net BOE of reserves organically resulting in an organic reserve replacement rate of 156%.","Our total reserve additions 497 million barrels came from Canada, as a result of project sanctions in the oil sands. Lower 48 was the second largest source of organic reserve additions with 293 million barrels and these are principally added from our Eagle Ford and Bakken unconventional programs and our Permian conventional programs. Over 100 million barrels were also added across the Asia Pacific segment.","Our all-in reserve replacement rate was 142% and this takes into account the impact of dispositions completely during the year that reduced reserves by 83 million BOE. We\u2019ll provide more detail on the reserve performance, including the costs in current and the forthcoming 10-K. We\u2019re sufficed it to say that we are really pleased with these results and we believe that our 40 plus billion barrel resource base hold significant future potential to be converted from resource to reserves over the coming years.","Now, I\u2019ll review our operating segments and provide some detail on our drilling programs, growth projects, and conventional and unconventional exploration activities. I\u2019ll cover some highlights from the fourth quarter and also update you on current activities and what we expect in the near future. Overall, our plans remain on track and the business continues to run well.","So please turn to slide 17 for a review of the Lower 48 and Latin America segment. Performance in this segment is dominated by our ongoing success in the unconventional plays, especially the Eagle Ford. In 2012, the Eagle Ford achieved 70,000 BOE per day of annual average production and averaged 89,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter.","As Ryan and Jeff already mentioned, we also achieved the milestone of over 100,000 BOE per day of peak daily rates in the fourth quarter. This is a tremendous accomplishment and credit to the entire Eagle Ford team.","During 2012, we adopted 17 rigs drilling the play. Late in the year, we began to reduce the rig count due to improved drilling efficiencies and the growing backlog of uncompleted wells, and we exited the year with a 11 operated rigs. We drilled 211 operated wells in 2012, and we now have a total of 313 wells online.","In addition, we have 87 wells drilled waiting on completion and 40 wells completed and are waiting tie in. Completing and connecting this backlog of wells is a key focus in 2013 along with achievement held by production status. We expect to complete the drilling phase of Acreage Capture by mid 2013 and we will reach field held by production status by year end.","During the year, we\u2019ll gradually phase into a 100% pad drilling in the play with full pad drilling expected in 2014. On the infrastructure side of the business, we currently chuck virtually all of our light crude barrels from Eagle Ford, but we are working diligently to access connections to pipelines for direct sales. In addition, we are actively adding infrastructure such as stabilization facilities that will remove light ends allowing us to get our light crude barrels to pipeline spec and maximizing our capture of NGLs.","Recently in the Eagle Ford, we and the industry have been experiencing inconsistent and higher than normal back pressures in the gas gathering systems, which have created variability in our daily production rates. We expect these constraints to be significantly reduce over the coming months.","Moving to the Bakken, we produced 24,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and we exited the year with 9 rigs operating in the play. In 2012, we completed a total of a 187 operated and non-operated wells. We have 34 operated wells waiting in completion and 14 wells ready to tie in, and we continue to be excited about the future of this play.","In the Permian, we hold a really strong legacy conventional position. In 2012, we averaged 50,000 BOE per day of production from our conventional assets and we added 98 operated wells and 50 non-operated wells to production. In the Permian, we are also testing several unconventional plays in the Midland and Delaware basins. Notably, in 2012, we drilled nine wells in the Wolfcamp with encouraging results. We also completed the 3D seismic survey across our Midland basin acreage, and we expect to continue drilling and testing Permian unconventional plays in 2013.","We haven\u2019t talked much about our activity in the Niobrara unconventional play. So we have now built over 130,000 net acres and what we believe is a sweet spot compatible to the [war-torn] area about half of this acreage was added in the fourth quarter. And as shown in the map, it\u2019s a contiguous position that provides scale benefits and development flexibility going forward.","We\u2019ve drilled six Niobrara wells in 2012 and recently completed a new 3D seismic survey across our existing acreage. This is a developing play and production results to be encouraging and that will be an important part of our exploration and development program going forward, we\u2019ll provide more detail at our Analyst Meeting in February.","Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to grow our deepwater position there. During the quarter, we were awarded 20,800 acres in the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, and we were also a pattern high bidder for 348,000 acres in the western Gulf of Mexico lease sale. These additions bring our current deepwater position to over 1.9 million acres making us the sixth largest acreage holder in the Gulf. I\u2019m not sure everyone recognizes just as substantial our position we have developed here.","Currently, we\u2019re drilling two partner operated wells in the deepwater Coronado and Shenandoah. Hummer a low-cost fireman was declared the dry hole in fourth quarter. We expect this quarter first operated well in 2013, the Thorn prospect, which will be an exciting milestone for the company.","Finally, we announced the sale of our Cedar Creek Anticline asset for over $1 billion. This is an opportunity to divest the decline in conventional asset that didn\u2019t compete for capital in our portfolio. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter.","So please go to slide 18 and we will talk about the Canada segment. The Canadian oil sands assets continue to operate extremely well. Weaker bitumen pricing this quarter has impacted margins, but operationally these assets are delivering strong volume growth. Our oil sands production exceeded 100,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2012 making us the second-largest SAGD producer in the oil sands. Currently, we\u2019re executing seven major projects across our FCCO joint venture and Surmont. We recently sanctioned Narrows Lake Phase A and Christina Lake Phase F. We are progressing construction on the large-scale development of Surmont Phase II.","Moving to our Western Canada business unit, we continue to focus our drilling activities on the liquids rich and light oil plays in our portfolio. Currently we are running 16 rigs drilling on our held by production acreage that are focused on liquids proven place such as the Montney, Glauconite and Cardium.","We\u2019re also testing other unconventional exploration opportunities within and outside our core areas in Western Canada. For example, we\u2019re currently drilling in the Duvernay play where we have a 112,000 net acres. We drilled and completed one horizontal well recently and are currently drilling a second well with three additional wells planned for this year. We also have drilling underway in our 120,000 net acre position in the (inaudible) play in the Horn River area.","Finally, in the Canol play in the Central Mackenzie Valley, we have 216,000 net acres. We plan to drill two vertical wells early this year to test the significant potential of this oil shale play, and we have two horizontal wells identified for drilling next year.","In summary, our Canada segment continues to operate extremely well. So let\u2019s finish out the North American segments with Alaska on slide 19. Full Alaska production resumed in the fourth quarter following successful third quarter turnarounds, and this segment continues to generate steady performance for the company, and is benefiting from development innovations using coiled tubing drilling or CTD and 4D seismic that are helping to offset natural field declines.","For example, in the fourth quarter we drilled \u2013 what we believe is the first ever Octo-lateral CTD well. That\u2019s a well with 8 different horizontal sections that was guided using a high-quality 4D seismic survey. In the fourth quarter, we sanctioned the Alpine West CD5 Project and expect production to startup in 2016.","As we mentioned before and you\u2019ve seen in the press, we are working with other producers in Alaska to evaluate LNG exports from the North Slope. The producer group has been evaluating development concepts and assessing the cost of major project components for various alternatives, and completion of this phase of work is targeted for the first quarter. We continue to invest around $1 billion a year of net capital for maintenance activities and infield exploitation programs across the North Slope, and we could make other significant investments in Alaska, but they will require more competitive state fiscal terms.","Let\u2019s move to slide 20, the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. Our Asia Pacific and Middle East operations are running well, and we are progressing several major projects in this segment. This is an area of significant growth for us over the next five years with most of the growth coming from Malaysia and APLNG.","In Malaysia, we achieved first oil from Gumusut in November, utilizing an existing floating and production storage in our floating facility at the Katy field. This facility will be used until our dedicated floating production system is completed later this year. We expect to reach peak production from Gumusut in 2014.","In early October, we also sanctioned the Malikai project, where we expect first production in 2017, and development activities also underway in Siakap North-Petai and KBB projects.","Also in Malaysia, we recently executed the production sharing contract for exploration Block SB311 offshore Sabah. This block covers about 250,000 acres and we are the operator with a 40% working interest. The PSC has a three-year exploration period with the work program of seismic and two exploration wells.","In China, Peng Lai averaged 43,000 BOE per day of net production during this quarter, and at Panyu we brought on nine growth wells in the fourth quarter. The growth development remains ahead of schedule and we expect to add about 8,000 BOE per day between now and 2014 as we drill additional wells from Britannia platforms, and this new production is expected to more than offset decline to Panyu.","Also in China, we recently announced the joint study agreement with Sinopec to access shale gas opportunities in Qi Jiang Block in the Sichuan province. The block covers an area of approximately 1 million acres, and the study will be carried over two years, including seismic and drilling obligations. In Qatar, we secured new long-term LNG sales commitments in the fourth quarter, and we now have about 80% of QG3 LNG production linked to crude prices under long-term agreements.","In Australia, our APLNG project remains on schedule and we intend to provide a more fulsome update on the development of the APLNG at the February Analyst Meeting.","On the exploration front, drilling continues in Australia. In November, we spudded the Zephyros-1 well, the second of the five-well appraisal program at Poseidon and in the Canning Basin, we are drilling a second exploration well to test as a 11 million acre position. So this is a very active segment for us just now and we are excited about the development and exploration opportunities here over the next several years.","Please turn to slide 21 and I\u2019ll provide an update on our Europe segment. In Europe, we are focused on progressing our major projects in the UK and Norway. Operationally, the UK had a challenging quarter due to unplanned downtime in the East Irish Sea, Southern North Sea, Britannia and Clair. This downtime accounted for an average of 23,000 BOE per day that was off-line in the fourth quarter. The East Irish Sea is still shut in, but we think once your facility is upgraded, it should be completed in the second quarter.","On a positive note, our Katy field development in the Southern North Sea was completed in December and gas production came online in January. We expect peak rate production of about 5,000 BOE a day from this field. In addition in the UK, the Jasmine and Clair Ridge developments are in execution with first production at Jasmine expected in the second half of this year. First production at Clair Ridge is targeted for the second half of 2016.","Moving to Norway, the Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects are progressing as planned. The Ekofisk South, the topside structural sections are being completed and first production is expected at the end of this year. Eldfisk II is also on track to production startup at the end of 2014, or early 2015. These projects are running smoothly and our base operations in Norway continue to perform well.","Finally, in Poland, we are continuing our exploration drilling program in 2013 as operated on a three Baltic were western concessions. Just a note, we have significant downtime in 2013 within this segment as we tie in new projects to the Ekofisk and J-Block production platforms. However, we expect to exit the year with very strong growth from these developments.","The final segment I will cover is other international on slide 22. There was a lot of activity in this segment during the fourth quarter. We announced sales agreements for Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria. We expect these transactions to close in the middle of this year.","On this slide, we\u2019ve shown 2012 average production rates and year end 2012 results for these assets. During the fourth quarter, Nigeria was severely impacted by flooding in the Niger Delta and you can see in this lower picture. The flooding began in late October and fourth quarter production was impacted by about 13,000 BOE per day, and first quarter production will also be impacted by this flood related downtime.","In Angola, we secured a rig for our plants to drill four exploration wells starting in 2014. The seismic results in our Angola blocks are really encouraging and we look forward to getting underway on drilling in this significant new exploration opportunity.","I will conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating the things you heard consistently this morning. We are focused on safely executing our base business while successfully funding our growth program. We are seeing the benefits of our conventional and unconventional exploration programs, and we continue to progress on major projects across the globe.","Now, I will turn the call over to Ryan for some closing comments.","Ryan M. Lance","Thank you, Matt. So please turn to slide 23 for some summary comments. I\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s remarks with a quick review of our 2013 priorities. These are not going to be a big surprise as they are continuation of the priorities we set for ourselves during last year.","Our highest priority is to focus on safety and operations excellence. And this is an imperative and it\u2019s a priority we take to heart at ConocoPhillips and throughout the company. We made significant progress on our strategic divestiture program in 2012, but we still have work to do. Importantly, we have to complete and close these divestitures which are expected to generate about $9.6 billion of proceeds. And these proceeds will largely be directed toward executing our drilling programs and our major growth projects.","As we have told you throughout the year, we have identified projects in hand and underway that will materially change the growth trajectory of our company over the next few years, and it\u2019s important that we execute on these activity. It\u2019s also important that we advance our exploration activities globally in both our conventional and unconventional portfolios.","2013 and 2014 are important years for testing the opportunities that we\u2019ve captured. And certainly last but not least, we\u2019ll maintain our commitment to shareholders by continuing to offer a unique value proposition that delivers growth, margins and a compelling dividend.","Finally a reminder, we\u2019ll have our first Analyst Meeting as an independent E&P company in New York on February 28. That meeting will provide more detail on our company\u2019s plans for the future and our long-term priorities for value creation. So thank you for listening.","Ellen DeSanctis","We\u2019ll turn the call now back to our operator to begin the Q&A process. Thank you, Christine, and thank you participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could clarify the 2013 production guidance, it looks like it is going to be relatively flat and certainly the market seems a little bit disappointed today in that number. But going back to your previous slides from last year, you did show a dip in expected production in 2013 internationally, and growth in the Lower 48 and North American production. So can you just clarify what\u2019s going with production and how you see it this being a bottom in the year and I have a follow-up after that.","Matt Fox","Thanks for the question Faisel. I think the production guidance is really pretty similar to what we have given in the past. We knew that 2013 would be the low point in our production for the year. So I\u2019m not sure what additional guidance we can have other than what we\u2019ve given on the call at this point. What we\u2019re trying to do is just make it clear now that the asset disposition program has become a little bit more into focus than it has been in the past. Just what the production levels are going to be as part of our portfolio long term. So we\u2019re trying to layout with this production guidance this morning.","I think part of the \u2013 we\u2019ve been, we anticipate being pretty successful in our asset disposition program. So we\u2019re probably at the high end of what we have \u2013 what some people have had \u2013 probably have in their models for the amount of production that\u2019s going out on dispositions as well.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Go ahead.","Ellen DeSanctis","Faisel, let me jump in here quickly, this is Ellen. I appreciate again the question. If you look at what we had in April for 2012 and what we had in April for 2013 and you kind of averaged it over the couple of years, it ends up being that we were \u2013 that the timing of divestitures actually ends up slipping from 2012 a little bit to 2013. And so if you look at it on a couple of year basis, it ends up being really right on guidance.","I think a way to think about this is exit rate to exit rate. Think about 4Q this year, the number just provided is sort of 1510, they had the noise out of this quarter compared to the fourth quarter to get to this guidance we provided. It will be very significant growth in quarter-over-quarter 2013 to 2012. We\u2019ll provide all of these updates at the Analyst Meeting, but I think of it as the divestitures stayed in the portfolio in 2012 a little bit longer, and exit rate to exit rate is going to be higher because of the timing startups.","Ryan M. Lance","Yeah. So I think as an important point is that, we are going to start seeing production growth in 2013 particularly late in the year or we have startups happening in the North Sea and the continued ramp up in oil sands continue to ramp up in the oil shale and right and plus the startup of projects in Malaysia.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Great. And just one other question, on the capital program, it looks like (inaudible) in \u2013 on slide 15 that are roughly $800 million in capital was associated with the asset divestitures in 2012. Is that roughly the same number in 2013?","Jeff Sheets","It\u2019s probably a little lower than that in 2013. But it really much depends on when assets actually end up leaving the portfolio. So it will be all through the year. We kind of need to be giving updates on how we see the capital program playing out this year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. The last question from me, bitumen prices were extremely low in the fourth quarter. Is there any plans for you guys to try to evacuate that production by other means and pipelines to get a higher realization?","Matt Fox","","I think there applies a little bit of long term, there will be moves to faint alternative markets for bitumen from the Canadian oil sands. I think that\u2019s a strategic comparative of the Canadian government, not just the bay oil companies\u2019 work in the oil sands, so we will see that happening over time. Of course, this is a short-term issue that we\u2019re facing just now, very much associated with refining constrains like BP is fighting refinery. So don\u2019t expect these daily rate differentials to be sustained for more than in the next few months. In the long term, other markets will be developed.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Faisel.","Ryan M. Lance","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a couple of quick ones please. Jeff, could you \u2013 you gave us the earnings numbers associated with the discontinued ops, but I guess to Faisel\u2019s point looks like there was over $800 million of spending associated with those assets. Can you help us with the operating cash flow impact? And if you could clarify whether or not the 15.7, 15.6, 15.7 target for this year for spending assumes the asset sales are out for the whole year, or if not number \u2013 not just higher a (inaudible) end of the year. And I have a quick follow-up please.","Jeff Sheets","So the operating cash flow numbers again \u2013 so the discontinued operations are Algeria and Nigeria. And I don\u2019t think we have \u2013 we\u2019re not going to be disclosing particular operating cash flow numbers for each of those segments. The capital is mostly a good outcome of Kazakhstan during 2012 \u2013 the number that was in 2012, I think that was probably the half of two-thirds of the number that was in \u2013 on the $800 million. As far as what\u2019s in for 2013, we are pursing a lot of different capital projects with fairly heavy spend. And there is going to be several things that could impact what our capital program ultimately been, ends up being at the \u2013 in 2013 as we execute on those projects. And timing of dispositions is really just one of those items.","So we\u2019ve assumed certain timings, but as I said on the answer to the last question, we\u2019re just going to need to be kind of continually updating that as we see the year develop.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jeff. I guess my follow-up is a \u2013 I guess relates to the exploration program, just to put some context around this, German had spent the last decades, trying to secure resources and build up very large drilling inventory I guess. And obviously, there is a lot of spending to achieve that, but now you are in a position where you are still underfunded relative to your CapEx and your dividends that you are spending, $2 billion to $3 billion in exploration. Can you help us with the logic of why that\u2019s the right thing at this point given the $1.5 billion write-off in 2012, why that\u2019s the right strategy at this point given that you should have theoretically had a lot of resource, and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks.","Ryan M. Lance","Yeah, Doug, this is Ryan. I think as we look out and think about the future opportunity, I think with this unconventional revolution that we are seeing in North America right now, and some of the technology advances in the deepwater arenas that are becoming pretty perspective. It\u2019s kind of in my view turn from a bid of resource scarcity that was leading to a lot of merger synergies over the last 10 or 12 years and resource capture into a view now.","But the resources aren\u2019t so scares, and there is a bit more abandon, certainly on the unconventional side in North America, what the technology is doing to improve the oil sands performance in Canada, and then what innovation and technologies done on the deepwater side. And we just think that growing organically, there is the opportunity set to go do that and the option value associated with growing organically is, we thought better in our portfolio then trying to do that through an M&A channel, or some resource access that way.","So we think it\u2019s important for the long-term growth. What the last 10 years did for this company is created a 40 billion plus barrel resource base and we\u2019re investing in that resource base right now. As we look forward into the future over the next 10 years, we see the exploration and the organic growth being more a driver to our other growth and development of the company.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, Ryan. Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance","Good morning, Doug.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","My question is one the mix shift that appears to be underway, the company meaning, but the size \u2013 there are profitability in the United States, it appears that there is going to be some positive mix effects overseas too. And on this point, my questions is, whether the earning from the discontinued operations, which I think we\u2019re listed is close to zero for 2011 and 2012, or the actual clean operating numbers. And also, do we have any updated information on the tax implications of the $10 billion of proceeds from those sales? I mean what I\u2019m trying to get to is, what is the approximate earnings loss and return for the $10 billion of pre-tax proceeds that you likely to receive?","Ryan M. Lance","Well, the fourth quarter was a challenging, again (inaudible) is Algeria, Nigeria and Kashagan assets, which of course not in operation yet, income or cash flow from these assets. So the adjusted earnings as we mentioned from these assets were $0.02 a share or $27 million during the fourth quarter. That was probably a particularly low number though because of the impact that Matt talked about in the flooding in Nigeria impacted Nigerian operations. But they weren\u2019t significantly higher than that in the previous quarters in the year also.","We generate cash flow a little bit higher than income in those, but we are also reinvesting capital as well. A long way of saying Doug that we don\u2019t really anticipate that moving those assets out of our portfolio would change our cash flow from operations very significantly.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","And Jeff do you have any insight for us on the tax implications of these divestitures. You highlighted $10 billion of sales proceeds and doing out the cash proceeds might be?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, the cash proceeds are going to be close to the numbers that we\u2019ve highlighted. These transactions [currently] may be very tax efficient.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Great. You\u2019re a great value. And also I have a question for Ryan, Ryan you\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Alaska and it seems like there is moment on the new fiscal regimen up there. So my question is, whether or not you feel that just most recent movement is real and if so whether or not the investment opportunity could be meaningful for the company.","Ryan M. Lance","Yeah, I do. I think Fed conversations with Governor Parnell over the course of last year and leading up to the session that started in January here in Alaska and he understands the lack of competitiveness and the fact that the current taxing system really takes away a lot of competitiveness instead of other Alaskan opportunities out there. So I think he is serious about trying to push something through the legislature. I think he has proposed some fiscal on the oil side, he has put a proposal out there. I don\u2019t think \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a tough hall through the legislature, but I also think that the \u2013 people are noticing and we\u2019ve said as a company that we would be prepared to ramp up our investment if it got more competitive with the changing fiscal system in Alaska.","Part of that side I think to the work that we are doing on ANS Gas as well and progressing the work on a potential LNG project. So part of that\u2019s tied into some of these as well, but I\u2019m probably slightly encouraged, but it\u2019s a long way till May when the session ends.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks a lot.","Ryan M. Lance","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good morning.","Ryan M. Lance","Good morning.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","I\u2019m sorry to be confused about this, but if I look at the slide 6 and you may well have explained this and I apologize, but the normalized 2012 is 1,497?","Jeff Sheets","Right.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then the outlook is 1,475 to 1,525. Is that the comparable number that we should think about when we are trying to get to your 3% volume target that we were looking from it? I think the point is that the idea was to \u2013 in order to balance cash against dividend and then CapEx, you would be growing volumes and margins at around, I think it was 3% per year each. Shouldn\u2019t I just be looking at that normalized number and then looking at the outlook and wondering where is the 3% growth?","Jeff Sheets","I think we\u2019ve been \u2013 we try to be clear in all the presentations that we\u2019ve given. The 3% to 5% is a multi-year target and the 2013 would probably be the low point in our production going forward. We still feel like the 3% to 5% production growth long-term is the right measure for us.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. So I guess the point that you previously made is that, I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about 2013 growth, why shouldn\u2019t I have been thinking about 2013 growth, yeah.","Ellen DeSanctis","Three to five we always kind of characterize as of a low point.","Jeff Sheets","So you will begin to see evidence of production growth as we are rolling towards the end of 2013.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah. And that\u2019s the high margin Malaysian barrels that will begin to road towards the cash in, cash out balance?","Jeff Sheets","It\u2019s there. It\u2019s also start up of the Jasmine project in the UK and then startup of projects in Norway as well, combined with the continued ramp up in the Lower 48 and the oil sands.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just to change tax lightly and you may want to wait for the Analyst Meeting to talk more about this, but there is an open question right now about business models amongst big oils and whether or not your global deepwater type operations and activity really fit well with U.S. unconventional. Could you give your perspective on the business mix, particularly business mix at this scale which is so differentiated in terms of its sheer size against any of the EMP? Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. I think as we look at our portfolio, we\u2019ve been doing this for quite sometime. As a company, we\u2019ve got large project capacity and capability. So we have got the capacity to make and execute these large projects globally around the world. And we\u2019ve also got a business model that really at \u2013 its basis is multifunctional integrated teams and we\u2019ve had a separate Lower 48 organization for the last number of years that has demonstrated its ability to run and execute an exploitation model or manufacturing model.","So when I look at the organization, Paul, I look at a group, or we can compare ourselves to the smaller independents weather it\u2019s Eagle Ford or Permian or Bakken, we look across the fence line and we\u2019re competing and we\u2019re in a low quartile position relative to how those folks are executing their plans. And then we have the capacity to build very large projects around the world whether it\u2019s LNG, oil sands, deepwater projects, Al Sabo or in the Gulf of Mexico here at home.","So I think it had the diversity, the diversification, the global part of the portfolio just adds a lot of capacity and something that we are interested in. So we like the mix of high deliverability and scalable recourse and that\u2019s what we\u2019re building in the company.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the longer-term growth, I mean, I guess this 1.8 billion barrels a day in the longer-term is still intact as the shale and the international projects come on stream in 2016?","Ryan M. Lance","That\u2019s correct.","Ellen DeSanctis","That\u2019s correct.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. And then how many rigs you got running in the Permian for this year?","Matt Fox","In the Permian, I\u2019m not sure how many we have run in the Permian. But right now we are focused on the Permian on two things conventional developments, with a significant amount of activity going on in conventional, and we have one or two rigs drilling up the testing the unconventional plays in the Midland and Delaware basin. The exact rig count is, now I don\u2019t have it on top of my head in the Permian.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","Ellen DeSanctis","Yeah, Ed, we\u2019ve got on the conventional, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we exited the year with four rigs running and then we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve announced, we\u2019ve got rigs running testing some of the unconventionals as well, but that would be \u2013 we ran, that\u2019s about our run rate for the year four to five.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And when I look at the 1.8, I mean how much roughly in volume terms are you including say from the Permian from this Niobrara sweet spot or from the Canada non-conventional plays that you are testing this year?","Ellen DeSanctis","We\u2019ll go through all that Ed at the Analyst Meeting. We\u2019ve shown you throughout the year our multi-year production levels from all our segments and we\u2019ll provide that as well as bit of a deeper dive into our sub play production outlooks as well. So if you can hold on for that, would appreciate it.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to gage when I look at that 1.8, how much additional shale upside there is beyond the 1.8, like I still have to wait for that until the Analyst Day.","Ellen DeSanctis","There is a lot of upside depending on the pace of the program is the way to think about it. What we have in here right now, what we\u2019ve had since April is actually we\u2019ve laid it out pretty carefully, it assumes a capital, it assumes a steady ramp in these and so what remains is how quickly do we go at these programs.","Ryan M. Lance","We\u2019ll feed you more in February Ed.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. And then on the disposal side, I mean, obviously, great execution so far and I guess with the cash proceeds coming in there\u2019s no pressure to be aggressive on some of the Canadian oil sands or further equity in APLNG. But I just wondered if there was any update on the timing of those potential sales, whether they were still in your thought process.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks, Ed. We now still continue to look for options to diluted APLNG and reduce some of our Canadian oil sands exposure. We have a very large position up there that we know we won\u2019t move forward developing some of that a 100%. So now we\u2019re still looking at those options, but haven\u2019t obviously announced anything yet.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks very much.","Ryan M. Lance","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions; the first one just for clarification in terms of just modeling the year going forward, I know you talked about the downtime in 2Q and 3Q, and also you have indicated that, you\u2019ll give some more clarity around the 2013 production guidance at the late February Analyst Meeting. But can you just talk a little bit about in terms of modeling the quarters out correctly, maybe to the extent of the downtime in some of the regions in 2Q and 3Q? I mean are there any countries where we will be looking at assets being off-line for an entire of either of these quarters. Can you give us a sense as to kind of the magnitude of the difference in some other regions?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, the area where we had a segment, where we have the biggest differential downtime compared to normal activities is in Europe. And this associated with tying in the new growth projects at Ekofisk, Eldfisk, and Jasmine. So, for example, in Ekofisk, we\u2019re going to see about 70% more downtime than we usually see, so maybe 28 days of downtime Ekofisk.","In Eldfisk, we\u2019ll see close to two months of downtime for the Brownfield activities and use to go on to tie-in Eldfisk II. And then a G Block where we are tying in the Jasmine project, and we\u2019re going to have over a months of downtime there, whereas typical downtime would be about 14 days at G Block. So the differential downtime is mostly in Europe and associated with these tie-ins. Is that helpful, Kate?","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much. And then just looking at \u2013 just kind of some of the margin growth going forward, you\u2019ve talked about margin improvement across the portfolio coming from factors such as mix shift and controllable costs. We also saw a cash margin contribution on per BOE basis that declined about I guess almost 10% or so from 2011 to 2012. I know lot of that\u2019s related to lower natural gas pricing, lower NGLs, and lower bitumen in North America.","But can you talk about the factors that would be driving the further cash margin improvements, how much of those factors actually manifested, what you were able to control as we move from 2011 to 2012 that may have just been dropped by some of the commodity price shift, and what we will be looking for in 2013 as we look for an uptick in cash margins.","Jeff Sheets","Cash margin growth very much is going to follow production growth. Because you think about what we\u2019re doing in our portfolio is, we\u2019re adding new production in areas where the margins are higher than our current production. So you haven\u2019t really, you haven\u2019t seen margin growth yet, because you haven\u2019t really seen production growth yet. So as we continue to add production in the Lower 48 as we add, as we startup LNG projects, as we startup the Malaysia projects, as we startup these projects we were just talking about in the North Sea and you see increased production that\u2019s when you really are going to have noticeable margin growth as well.","This year, I think as you\u2019ve just correctly summarized, we did see the degradation in cash margins over 2011 to 2012, but that really is driven primarily by the significant drops we saw in natural gas prices and NGL prices, and bitumen prices. So when we always talk about margin growth, we talk about margin growth if you \u2013 whatever prices (inaudible) the same prices are constant across time that we would see per barrel margins growing in this 3% to 5% and that\u2019s again is over a multiyear time period as we bring on these growth projects.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, all right. And then just one final question, I know you talked about the F&D estimate potentially coming later, but can you give us a sense as to how it might compare with 2012 \u2013 excuse me with 2011 directionally or how it also might compare with the cash contribution per BOE that we saw in 2012. And I\u2019ll leave with there. Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","So that\u2019s another item that I think we would just say that we will give you some updates in February. You also see some of this as we file our 10-K in late February as well. We\u2019re kind of working through those numbers now. So may be we\u2019d rather just give that guidance in February.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JP Morgan","","Sure. Okay, thank you very much.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reed of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ryan M. Lance","Morning, Roger.","Operator","Roger, if you are on mute, can you un-mute your phone? Okay, we will move on. The next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Good morning. Three quick ones. In 2011, you ended with about 29% of your proven reserves \u2013 Conoco\u2019s proving reserves being PUDs. You booked a lot of unconventionals this year. Can you say approximately how high your PUD count will rise because historically Conoco has been very under booked these years?","Jeff Sheets","So with our \u2013 the booking that we announced today, PUD percentage is about 35%.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. So you\u2019re still under that line?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah. And this is actually dominated by the oil sands.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Sure.","Jeff Sheets","That represents about 60% of our PUDs, but we think more detail will become \u2013 before coming on that.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","No, that\u2019s fine, you\u2019re still under. Regarding benchmarking, that Ryan mentioned in the unconventional plays, could you be a little bit more specific on how you are doing inside the Eagle Ford and Bakken vis-\u00e0-vis a lot of the smaller entities.","Ryan M. Lance","Again, that\u2019s something that we are going to get more in-depth analysis on the end of next month in the Analyst Meeting. It may be a bit too much detail for the call, but we will get more detail at that time.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, well, it\u2019s worth of shot. Last one from me is Angola, you said you ran seismic, you\u2019ve processed some of the seismic, how fixed its out there for the pre-salt plays, I\u2019m just curious.","Matt Fox","","On the top of my head, I don\u2019t know the thickness. They clearly is \u2013 it\u2019s got similarities to the Brazilian side. I mean, they were together, they were paying all those, this was the positive. So the number on top of my head, I don\u2019t know. The seismic though is looking very encouraging. I think you are aware of this, just issues and graphic on that slide we\u2019re just outboard of the Cameia discovery. So we know we have a working petroleum system, the seismic looks encouraging from the potential of identifying these carbonate buildups that perform the play on the Brazilian side of the margin. So we are encouraged and we are looking forward to getting drilling there.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Ryan M. Lance","Thanks, John.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","We\u2019ll take one more question operator. We\u2019re running a little long here, but let\u2019s take one more.","Operator","Our last question is from all Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, several quick one. Ryan, in addition to you guys still looking at oil sand and APLNG maybe diluting the interest on, is there any other major offset that you guys still considering or there is pretty much that the other sales program would be largely done at this point?","Ryan M. Lance","Well, Paul, we\u2019re always looking at the portfolio and making sure that the assets that we have in the future investments that are in those assets compete in the portfolio. So its things like see Cedar Creek Anticline, there was an opportunity that presented itself or we got for value. We looked at the future investments in that particular asset. They made more sense to the purchaser than they did to us, didn\u2019t compete in our portfolio.","So even though it wasn\u2019t \u2013 one that was identified and we have talked about, it was an opportunity where we got \u2013 where we feel like we got full value and got to redeploy the \u2013 we will redeploy those proceeds into capital opportunities that are higher returns for us going forward. So we\u2019ve talked about wanting to reduce our oil sands footprint a little bit and some further dilution at APLNG, we\u2019re still working on those but any other specific asset size would be premature to say anything about that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Along that line, one of your smaller competitor in activeness that has some firework recently, and I think one of the suggestion from the activeness is that maybe that is better off that you put up the company between the share volume which we will be having a much higher multiple in comparing to the rest of the company. And one may argue that, that could potentially also apply to ConocoPhillips that the oil sand and the shale oil will be higher multiple. I suppose that based on the way you answered previous question, this is not an option that you guys believe is attractive to you; just want to make sure that we understand.","Jeff Sheets","Paul, we\u2019ve \u2013 I appreciate it. We all read the papers these days and see what\u2019s going on. I think as we came out as an independent company we laid out our plans. We told the shareholders what we\u2019re trying to do to grow this company and improve the returns and still they have compelling dividend back to the shareholders. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on as executing our plan.","We think we\u2019re on the front end of that plan. We delivered in 2012. I think the shareholders should be pretty happy with what we did in 2012. We realized we\u2019ll reach a lower point in our production in 2013. We set that all along, because we said, we\u2019re going to core up the portfolio and sell some assets.","We look at our future. We look at the investments that we\u2019re making in the growth projects that we talked about today. Those are compelling investments that are high return. They\u2019ll move our margins, they\u2019ll move our growth. And then we\u2019re doing some exciting things on the exploration side. So we think there is exciting future. We think diversification globally and amongst all these different resource types and asset types is an important for our company our size.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Final one from me, I guess for Matt, Matt, if I look at this year, 2012 reserve replacement, excluding oil sand for the rest of the portfolio, I guess we are facing about 82%. Any idea that over the next couple of years, should we assume some of 400 million to 500 million fell a year of the reserve addition from oil sand? Is it a reasonable one way or that 2012 is somewhat unique and we\u2019re going to see a slowdown on that addition way?","Matt Fox","So the bookings in the oil sands essentially flow of the project sanctions. And so as we \u2013 and that seems to be lumpy dependent on how we go \u2013 as we go through the project development thesis. So we wouldn\u2019t expect the \u2013 to be consistent at all over the next several years, there will be lumpy as we go through the project sanction fees. We do have a significant remaining resource plays in oil sands that hasn\u2019t been converted to reserve shale. But we don\u2019t expect a consistent booking from year-to-year, because has to follow the project sanction.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Sure, and based on the project backlog that do you think the next couple of years that the reserved booking maybe substantially less or above the same or just going to be higher?","Matt Fox","I mean we expect to replace more than a 100% of reserves, and as we go forward, as we develop the oil sands, the unconventionals and the other projects we have in our portfolio that is not going to be consistent from year-to-year. But over the long run, we\u2019re going to place in more than 100% of reserves for the next five years.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paul. Let\u2019s go ahead and wrap it up here. I appreciate everybody sticking around a little bit. As a reminder, we will be in New York on February 28, and we look forward to seeing you there. Ryan and I are available for any further follow-up questions that you might have and appreciative your time. Operator, we are ready to winded up here.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-mode. Later we will conduct question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications, ConocoPhillips. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Christine, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the second-quarter earnings call.","With me today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects.","Our cautionary statement is shown on page 2 of our presentation. We'll make some forward-looking statements on today's call that refer to estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors noted on this slide and in our SEC filings.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website.","So with those administrative details out of the way, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thanks, Ellen, and good morning. I'll begin on slide 4. This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will provide more detail in a moment.","But the key messages are we delivered strong operational performance; our financial performance is improving; and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more volatile prices.","Let me quickly go through this slide. Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second-quarter performance exceeded guidance despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the midpoint of our 2016 production guidance by 2%. We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from 5.7 billion to 5.5 billion based on efficiency improvements really across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned. And Al will talk about these projects in more detail.","Our financial performance was challenged, like the rest of industry, but did improve sequentially in line with prices. Three of five of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefits of having high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations, and we ended the quarter with over 4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale program and expect to achieve our goal of about 1 billion of proceeds this year.","We reduced debt by 800 million in the second quarter, so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet. On the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deepwater exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deepwater position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah.","Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the business, and we are lowering our full-year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as prices improve. And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of investors.","We have set priorities and targets that will guide our allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can create value as prices recover and through future price cycles. So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide.","The way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On last quarter's call, I had outlined the principles of our capital allocation approach, which are shown on the left side of this slide. As a reminder, they were that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend. Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet; the recent downturn has emphasized the importance of this principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion. And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth, where per share growth will compete with absolute growth. We have positioned the company to compete on returns; so while we have a large, low cost of supply portfolio, we'll be disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth.","Now, establishing these principles was an important first step in articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also wanted to set priorities and targets that will guide our incremental allocation decision, and these are shown on the right hand side of this slide. Let me step through them. The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base.","Now, let me be clear that flat production is not our goal; but at a minimum we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion. We believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors, and that's a real advantage. After our cash from operations exceeds the level required to cover our dividend and capex for flat volumes, the next use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend, our dividend annually at a real rate. We think this is a prudent and sustainable target. Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion.","Our target is to reduce debt as it matures, but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A-rated balance sheet, which we think is a competitive advantage. Next we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company our size and maturity; so when we have available cash flows we expect to return additional capital through share buybacks.","We believe this will be a differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of returning capital to our owners. And our final priority of cash flows will be to invest in our large, low cost of supply captured resource base. We'll allocate capital to the lowest cost of supply opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and medium cycle programs; and we have that inventory to grow.","So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula, but rather as a relative ranking of the choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles we can envision pulling on all these levers; at other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle we'll be disciplined.","So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions on this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away from my comments is that we know where we're headed and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from our competitors. So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results.","Don Wallette","Thanks, Ryan. I'll provide a quick overview of the second-quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on slide 7. The business is performing well operationally, and we grew production 3%; but the low commodity price environment continues to impact financial results.","For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28 per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share. A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and, with respect to adjusted earnings, recognized the Gibson and Tiber wells as dry holes. We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter, and we are increasing our guidance for the year from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance, but it's also related to an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions. We continue to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the year-ago quarter.","Second-quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.","Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover production. Our second-quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which exceeded our guidance despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year's second-quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per day, or 1.523 million when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter.","If you turn now to Slide 9 I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with 2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of 600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe. Since we don't expect a significant reversal of our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year.","Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first six months, debt increased by 3.8 billion. This reflects the 4.6 billion of debt raised in the first quarter, offset by 800 million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was 3 billion. After dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with 4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance.","Al Hirshberg","Thanks, Don. I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in the second half of the year, and then we can take your questions. If you turn to slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments.","In the Lower 48 our production in the second quarter was 503 thousand barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of 17 thousand barrels a day compared to this time last year. The unconventionals produced 262 thousand barrels per day, or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's better performance than we had expected, driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but also by the lag effects from our ramp down in rig activity. Now that we're running with three rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5 appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.","Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp up of our oil sands projects which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second quarter, and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.","Moving to slide 12 I'll cover the Alaska and Europe & North Africa segments. In Alaska we saw growth compared to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong production at CD5 and Drill Site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the Cook Inlet during the quarter.","In Europe & North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter. In the UK, at Clair Ridge the drilling and production modules were successfully installed, and progress is also continuing at Alder where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.","Moving to slide 13, I'll cover the Asia Pacific & Middle East and Other International segments. In APME, production was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year.","The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp up at APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations, with 27 cargoes loaded in the first half of the year, including our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of 2016. In Malaysia, Gumusut is continuing to produce at a high level, and third party pipeline commissioning is underway at KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well.","The sailaway of the Malikai TLP was completed this month with startup expected next year. In the Other International segment the key milestone was signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. This sale is expected to generate proceeds of $400 million to $450 million.","If you turn to Slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full-year production guidance to 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels per day; that's an increase of 35 thousand barrels per day or about 2% over prior guidance, while at the same time we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance.","For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million and 1.55 million barrels per day, which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska. Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing several other projects in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific. We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of the year, and we're continuing to market our remaining deepwater exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.","Then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November 10. At that meeting we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost of supply portfolio, and our future investment plans. So we look forward to seeing all of you at that update.","And now I'll turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Ryan, just curious, your partner in Canada was saying that they are ready to restart Christina Lake. Given that your portfolio is different than theirs, is there any maybe scheduling differences in opinion between you and your partner?","Ryan Lance","Scheduling what? Scheduling differences, Paul?","Paul Cheng","Yes, in terms of the expectation, given that I think the first set of assets that you're going to go back and reinvest, I don't believe is going to be oil sands; I presume that is going to be in Eagle Ford and Bakken and Permian. So how is that we reconcile there?","Ryan Lance","Yes. No, well, we spend quite a bit of time with our partner up in Canada talking about our plans. We've been fairly well aligned in terms of what the performance and the opportunity set looks like. I'm aware they've -- some of their comments are wanting to ramp up some of their spending, get back to work on some of the projects with increased oil prices. But we've got that accommodated in our plans as well, and we work really close with them to make sure that we're doing the right things and that the projects make sense economically and have a competitive cost of supply.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Just a real quick one for me. Maybe do you have a production number for Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian in the second quarter?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, I can quote you those numbers. It's actually, production is actually up in the Eagle Ford versus, from the first quarter to the second quarter.","Ellen DeSanctis","I've got them here if you want.","Al Hirshberg","So you asked the same question in the first quarter about Eagle Ford, and we were at 168,000; we're up to 171,000 in the second quarter. Bakken was 65,000 in the first quarter; 64,000 in the second quarter. So, actually if you add Eagle Ford and Bakken together, we're up a few thousand barrels a day in the second quarter versus the first quarter.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I think it's still morning, isn't it? So, Ryan, I think, is it slide number 5? The 20% to 30% cash flow shareholder payout, I think that's a new number on the slide deck this quarter. I just wanted to get clarifications to make sure we're interpreting this properly. That includes the dividend, I assume?","Ryan Lance","Yes, it does.","Doug Leggate","Okay, so basically can you just remind, on that basis then, can you just give us some idea as to what kind of thresholds you are thinking about? Because I imagine $70 oil, that would imply a much bigger number than obviously $50 oil. So can you give us some idea? Is it a limit to the level that you would put on that, or should we just take that as a blanket guidance going forward?","Ryan Lance","Well, Doug, I think the way to think about that is we recognize that, as prices recover, that the dividend payout that we have today doesn't represent probably enough return to shareholders in a recovered price scenario where we're starting to free cash flow above our requirements of the current dividend and to keep our production flat at a minimum. So we recognize that as prices recover that's not enough payout to the shareholders. Even when we spun the company we were talking about these kinds of payout levels. We were doing that with just the ordinary dividend at the time.","So we set a pretty broad range, 20% to 30%, and clearly we'll take a look at that as the circumstances warrant. And then compare really, as you get down to those fourth and fifth priorities, it's about what kind of investments do we have that the shareholders would want us to be making in the portfolio? What kind of returns do they have? What kind of cost of supply do they have? And how does that compare to where our stock is trading at the time and the value that we see in the shares? And compare those two and make those decisions as we go down the road.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thanks for that. My follow up is related, I guess. It's a clarification on your debt targets, because again number three on that list is pay down debt. You're already at a net debt number below $25 billion and you're talking about paying debt as it matures. So are you now at the debt level you're comfortable with? Or do you still want the absolute debt to be below $25 billion? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Don Wallette","Yes, Doug; no. This is Don. We wanted to be real clear. We talk about balance sheet debt. We could be talking about net debt, too, but we didn't want there to be any ambiguity. What we're looking at is balance sheet debt that at the end of the first quarter was approaching $30 billion or so, and that's when we set our target and said we want to bring that down to a number less than $25 billion.","Doug Leggate","Okay. But Don, to be clear, if you are paying maturities as they come due, I assume that's from cash on the balance sheet. So isn't that essentially a net debt number?","Don Wallette","Well, we'll see how the macro environment turns out, but we would hope that that would come not just from cash on the balance sheet but also from organic cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question, guys. You've clearly had a lot of success ramping at APLNG. Is there a point with Train 1 or getting into Train 2 where the project in aggregate begins to be a net cash generator?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, this is Al; I'll take that one. As we -- we're still spending a lot of capital in on construction on Train 2, of course; but once both trains have ramped up the project, if you include even the financing, the cost of that, throws off cash when you get to around a $45 barrel kind of number.","Pavel Molchanov","$45 barrel at JCC?","Al Hirshberg","Yes.","Pavel Molchanov","Pricing? Okay. Just second quick one on the Senegal sale. Woodside threw out some numbers on the underlying resource. Were any of those included in your proved reserves at last year-end?","Al Hirshberg","No. That's a recent discovery that's a long way from any kind of proved reserves. Our proved reserves for Senegal on our books would be zero.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Good result, gentlemen. Maybe if I could talk about your free cash flow generation a little bit, we see you guys -- you were near free cash flow breakeven even at $45 a barrel in the quarter here in 2016, which is probably a little ahead of what our anticipated pace was, in terms of you guys getting there in the medium term. Are you ahead of pace on cost reduction and cost structure optimization? And could you talk about maybe continuing momentum that you have in that regard going forward and the potential to dip below your potential $45 a barrel target in terms of covering CapEx and dividends?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, Ryan, I think we've really got -- in terms of the progress there we've got three things all working in our favor. We're higher on volumes; we're lower on CapEx; and we're lower on CapEx. So all those things are moving in the right direction to help drive down our breakeven cost of capital. We've trimmed back our guidance on CapEx and CapEx to reflect that. But we continue to make a lot of progress there. I can go into the details more if you want, but really that's the big-picture answer, that all three of those things are driving us in the right direction.","Ryan Lance","And, Ryan, we're not satisfied with where the numbers are at today, and we've got a lot of effort to continue to drive them down to get the same scope done for less capital and less cost as well. Because we've got to continue to attack that breakeven and make sure we get the breakeven for the company down as low as we possibly can and be as competitive as we can. Because we believe this world of low and a lot of volatility in prices is here to stay. So we've got to thrive in the down cycle.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe as a follow-up to that question, there seems to be a common concern amongst at least part of the market in terms of your confidence and your ability to deliver on the medium term outlook, in terms of your ability to sustain volumes longer term at the stated levels of capital spend or the capital intensity that you mentioned in your comments. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you think your portfolio has evolved over the years and how it's positioned to sustain that free cash flow generation? And is there maybe some additional granularity on the portfolio that you might be able to provide going forward that could help increase investor confidence in this?","Al Hirshberg","Yes. You've heard a lot from us over the last few years about the shift that we've had from mega-projects, longer cycle to shorter cycle, more flexible investment; that's really standing us in good stead now. But if you just look at our near term performance on volumes, take, start out with second quarter volumes: we beat the midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day and were even above the high end of our range. And that was despite being, having about a negative 15,000 at Surmont due to the wildfires. So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals, as you could see from some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier.","The decline, even running just three rigs in the Lower 48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a key driver. Then as you look toward the end of the year at the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes, we'll have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCL. So we have a lot of different projects that will be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive that volume performance of at least flat, or even growth if we want to, at these lower kind of capital levels that we've been talking about. And of course, we're going to show you a lot more detail on that in November at our Analyst Day.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh, of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Hi, there. Good afternoon. The first question is just a follow up to Doug's question on the leverage level, the $25 billion target. You have $1.250 billion coming due in the third quarter, $1 billion in 2017. You talked about maybe accelerating some paydowns if you have asset sales. But I guess it would seem to imply that the $25 billion target on a gross basis wouldn't be reached until maybe late 2017, perhaps. But I'm guessing you are probably thinking faster than that, based on the cash you might have coming in and the cash on the balance sheet. So maybe you could just clarify that for us in terms of when you think you can reach that target.","Ryan Lance","Yes, Phil, we thought it was important to throw out an absolute gross target of debt, so Don talked about below $25 billion. And then we've been, I think some of the questions we've had since that time is saying: Well, you're not going to do anything else until you get to that point, so you're going to spend all those $4 billion required to get from $29 billion down to $25 billion, will be at the expense of everything else. What we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow.","So as we get some recovery in price and we're generating cash flow above what it takes to hold production flat and pay the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do anything else, because we think we can get there over time, over the next couple of years, as you say, with the natural maturities that we have on the balance sheet. And then -- and we know that we want to get back into the market with some asset sales when the market starts recovering.","So we know that we'll be selling some more of our noncore assets, and we'll always have that to help us accelerate that debt repayment. But the main message: it's manageable; we think we have a plan; we can get there with just through the natural maturities, and we can get to a point that we think is solidly investment grade in the A credit rated band.","Phil Gresh","Got it. Okay, so you're comfortable with the next couple years. Okay. The question second question was just on the production beat. I believe maybe it was earlier this year you gave outlooks for each region from a production standpoint. I think Lower 48 at the time was down 3% or so, if I have my numbers right. Maybe you could just give us your revised thoughts on the production outlook for different regions. It sounds like Lower 48 is the key driver of the beat and raise.","Al Hirshberg","I think the biggest change in our production outlook when I was asked on the first-quarter call with coming down to three rigs and holding that three-rig level for the rest of the year, how much did we think our Lower 48 unconventional would decline on the year and my answer was 10%. At that time it looked -- our projection was we would drop about 10% in our Lower 48 unconventional. With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number has been cut roughly in half. About 6% now is what we think we'll be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a big change, holding that same flat three-rig rate. We've also got some improved production in Europe and in Malaysia. So really if you think about it, those are all above-average margin barrels for us. So that's part of the other good news in our production beat, is that it's coming from places where we have higher-margin barrels.","Phil Gresh","Got it; that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber","Thanks, everybody, for taking my question. Ryan, you mentioned you have one of the lowest capital intensity portfolios. I wanted to just explore that a little bit more and follow up on the earlier question. But at 5 billion to 6 billion you've noted you can keep your production profile flat. I believe that translates to CapEx on a per-barrel basis in the low teens. Is that the type of F&D you believe you can achieve with your current portfolio? And can you talk about what gives you that confidence? I'm really trying to understand if the 5 billion to 6 billion of spend cannot only hold production flat but also replace your reserves. Or if you're comfortable drawing down your proved reserve life to a certain extent, given the strength of your resource base.","Ryan Lance","Yes, there's quite a lot in that, Guy. Let me just start at your first question. Yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at today's inflationary rates and what's going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level. So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio, even at the lower capital level, yes, we're pretty clear about what we can do over a long period of time at that level.","And a lot of that's driven by the fact that after we get APLNG up and running, second train, and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 we've got a third of our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. I think that's what's unique about our company, and that's what helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind of level that we're seeing.","Now as that translates to F&D it's a little bit tougher question, because now you bring in the vagaries of reserves and bookings and all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally you're right: it has to drive F&D down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, we do have a pretty high R to P, so we are willing to let that moderate some, because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over three and five year periods, yes, the F&D should follow. And as you are starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, even in the Eagle Ford we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of Eagle Ford. So F&D is lumpy, but generally over time it should happen. But there is probably some drift in R to P.","Guy Baber","That's very helpful. Thank you. Then my follow-up is, as CapEx continues to be revised lower here, I just want to make sure that we stay on top of the latest view in terms of the level and the amount of longer cycle committed capex that rolls off the books from 2016 to 2017. I think you previously talked about $1.5 billion or so. Is that still the case?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, that story hasn't changed much from last quarter where, you're right, we were talking about $1.5 billion. Remember that about $1 billion of that was from APLNG and FCCL joint ventures and about $0.5 billion from deepwater roll off. The APLNG both because of a bit lower spending and a bit higher revenues, because the Train 1 is running above expectations, is using a little less. So that it may, the $1.5 billion may be down a tenth or so, but it's still in that same kind of range.","And that roll off does provide room for us should we choose to increase rigs in the Lower 48 next year. That roll off money is where some of that can come from and still keep us down at these same capital levels next year. Some of that money will also be used with some of our medium cycle size projects that are in a phase of execution, where some of their CapEx is going up from 2016 to 2017.","Guy Baber","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read, of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Thank you. Good morning. I guess two questions I have. One is you described the decline in the opex; can you give us an idea what you see as sustainable there? Or are there further goals to reduce it? Just trying to get an idea how much of that is internal and how much of that might be external as activity recovers, prices go up, and some of those costs have to go up.","Al Hirshberg","Yes, good question, Roger. I think you've seen us continue to drive our opex down. I think our organization has really continued to outperform versus the targets that we've set. We just remind ourselves, we're down $1.2 billion of opex with this new $6.8 billion target versus where we were last year. That's 15% from last year. And we're down $2.9 billion from 2014, 30%. So we've driven our operating costs down about 30% from this year versus 2014. But we're not done. We've got a lot of very firm plans and work that's been underway this year to continue driving those costs down next year substantially. So we'll do the reveal on that at the November Analyst Day, but there's more to come on our operating costs. And of course, the second part of your question, we are very focused on trying to do this in a sustainable way with structural cost reductions and not just the cyclical deflation.","Of course the deflation is a piece of this, and we're trying to hang on to that, get as much of that as we can along the way and hang onto it for as long as we can. But we recognize that there will be reflation if prices ever come back one day and we'll give some of that back. But we're dominated here by the structural side and real significant changes we've made in the way we're running our business.","Roger Read","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Then a cash flow question here. As we looked at the data that came through on the spreadsheet, saw a big hit on the deferred taxes side. I just was hoping to get maybe a little bit of a feel for what that is; and then maybe an idea of how to think about cash taxes when prices do recover and the company is generating profitability again.","Don Wallette","Yes, Roger; this is Don. Yes, we continue to see deferred taxes as a use of cash, being in a non-taxpaying position in several of the key jurisdictions that we're in. I think that probably the way to think about it going forward is that we take a look at the price decks that the analyst community is using, and I think that on the basis of those it's really unlikely that we're going to be in a taxpaying position in North America and in the U.S. and Canada for probably the next two or three years, at least, under those types of price environments. So it's going to be a while before that deferred tax flips from a use to a source.","Roger Read","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair Syme","Really had the question back on Senegal, you look at the equity performance of some of the partners in the asset, and it did suggest the market, so the sales price, is fairly low. Can you maybe comment on that and why you think the deal was done?","Ryan Lance","We think we got fair value for the asset, based on our assessment of the resource and the cost to develop it.","Alastair Syme","As a follow-up, can you maybe talk about where you're at regarding the rest of the asset sales and, again, what the environment is like for those sort of transactions? Specifically referring to the deepwater.","Ryan Lance","Yes. No -- so we've been told -- telegraphing that we think we're on track for $1 billion of asset sales this year and we're on track to do that. So we'll deliver that. We've said we've taken a number of producing oily assets off the market because we just don't think the market is there for a fair value with respect to that. So we're not going to sell assets into that kind of a headwind. We have done some North American dry gas assets, and we continue to look at those in the portfolio and see if we can get what we believe is a fair value relative to how we view the assets.","That's certainly what we felt like with the Senegal transaction. And specifically on the deepwater, we've signaled to you what we think about Keathley Canyon is there's something there, but the development probably is smaller and it doesn't compete for capital in our portfolio. So we'll be looking at what we can do about that particular area going forward as well. Senegal, we'll look at it, I mean Shenandoah. We've had a successful appraisal well there, so we're really encouraged about what that looks like. We'll think about putting that back on the market as well. But again if the market's not there for what we think is full value, we'll continue to be a part of that development.","Alastair Syme","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta, of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Neil Mehta","Good morning, good afternoon, guys. Want to ask a couple high level questions and, Ryan, it goes back to your slide of the unique value proposition. I know one of the pushbacks that you often get from investors is that Conoco is kind of stuck in the middle; for some who look at you as a major, they'll say you have a low yield, and for some that are looking at you as an E&P, they'll be more focused on growth. Is the message on that slide and going into the Analyst Day that the most powerful differentiating factor is the free cash flow? Is that what you see as that most powerful, unique value proposition point?","Ryan Lance","Well, I think that the leverage to the price has a point there where we can start to generate free cash flow with modest increases in the prices. And we've tried to tell you what we're going to do with that free cash flow. And a big sort of, certainly a prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is. But I'd tell you, Neil, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio. The maintenance capital to keep flat production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the low cost of supply we have in the portfolio: we'll show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in this E&P world for a company like ours that is focused on returns.","We know, given our size, that we can't compete against the growth of the pure play smaller growth companies. But we're going into a world of lower and high volatile prices. And having some predictability, which I think we've shown through the execution since we spun the company, we've delivered on everything we've said. We know how to run the company. We know how to run this business. We know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P space for a company that is differential on returns and that can be more predictable through the cycles, and do that both on the low and the upper end.","Finally, ever since we spun the company we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right off the top, and that's what we're trying to tell you here is an important part of our offering, the 20%, 30% we recognize needs to go to the shareholder with great discipline within the Company. And that, combined with our flexible investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think will differentiate ourselves.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that, Ryan. Just as a follow up, I always appreciate your perspective on the oil macros. You operate in a lot of countries that we have less visibility on. You took, I think, a little bit more of a cautious view earlier this year, partly driving the dividend reduction. Where do you see we are in the rebalancing process? And what do you think is the biggest upside and downside risk to the base case?","Ryan Lance","Yes, I think we're concerned about it, Neil. I think the guys -- we've been talking and preaching for quite a bit of time we need to be prepared for lower prices and volatility. And I think we're in that, and we're seeing that in spades right now. So in our outlook, our guys did predict that, yes, we would see refineries start to cut run rates, and we'd see gasoline inventories start to build. Because we were a little bit surprised to even see the crude oil inventory build in the last week like it did.","So we think we're in -- while the supply and demand are closely balanced, it doesn't take a lot of movement on either end to create the kind of volatility that we're seeing. So as we think about it going forward, it's got to be really, really cautious as we go through 2016. It's going to take well into 2017 before we see any real increases in the price. So we continue -- as Al said, we're battening down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver the scope. And we're focused on reducing the cost and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it can possibly get, because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next year, year and a half.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate it, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Both of my questions are on Slide 5, so maybe I can just ask them both. I'm really just trying to get a point of clarity here on number two, the annual dividend growth being a real dividend target, with inflation trending around, say, 1% or so. Is that to say that that's literally what you're trying to achieve is just maintaining pace with inflation? I don't mean to be pedantic with it, but I just wanted to clarify that.","And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders. That's being put above growth capital. So is it fair to think that the buybacks are going to take priority over reinvesting? In other words, CapEx will remain at the 5 billion to 6 billion level until you've begun doing some buybacks? Thanks.","Ryan Lance","Yes, Blake, I guess a couple things on the dividend. We say targeting real annual returns; we're not trying to -- I'm not trying to put a percentage to it. I realize the inflation rate is quite low today, but what we're trying to say is we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the dividend. So we're recognizing we went through the pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize as we go through the middle part of the trough into the upper end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable distribution plan around share buyback.","And while we say a lot of the -- can you be counter-cyclic in that kind of world? We're going to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over the next few years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace. And we'll make a decision on what the level of share buyback is.","Certainly at a minimum we'd like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our employees provide. So that would set a floor on the share buyback. But again I don't think there's bright lines between all of these. As I tried to say in my comments, as the prices start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback, but we're also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly we view giving -- making sure that we hit the 20% to 30% return to our shareholders is an important hurdle for us to make before we start investing in the portfolio.","Blake Fernandez","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake, of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake","Yes. My first question is obviously congrats on the well recoveries driving the surprise in Lower 48 volumes. Obviously that's probably lowered the breakevens as well. So at the same time you've got global inventory positions still high. Maybe talk a bit about where the breakevens are now in the core shale assets in North America and then what you'd need to see, maybe on the macro side or maybe just in terms of the well performance, to start to increase activity levels. Because it does feel as if you've got this following wind from your projects, so you don't necessarily have to rush.","Al Hirshberg","Yes, I think that's right. Our answer to that same question really hasn't changed from what we said on the first quarter, that we don't have some set price that's going to drive us out to add rigs in the Lower 48. We do have the volume momentum that I was talking about earlier and the better volume performance we're getting from just the rigs we're running. But we're not going to get excited and rush out there and add rigs every time the price bumps up. The price since the last call, the last quarter's been up, it's been down, did the same thing this time last year.","So we're not on a hair trigger to go out and add rigs in that kind of situation, even though we do have a very high quality opportunity set to invest in. So I would say we're ready but we're patient. And when we do add rigs we're going to be very mindful about it. The macro situation will have to be solid, and we're going to have to have the right costs that we'll have to be able to make sure we get the right contracting to be able to go back at the cost level that we need to, to maintain that low cost of supply that we have from those assets.","Ed Westlake","Some idea of where that breakeven has fallen, given the well performance improvements? Say Bakken and Eagle Ford.","Al Hirshberg","Those numbers are very low. That's really not what's driving us. Those, we could drill like crazy right now in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and make a lot of money at today's prices. Those have got cost of supplies down in the 30s. But that's not really what's driving us. We don't want to go run out and add rigs too quickly before we get to a clear macro environment that's going to be supportive of that.","Ryan Lance","I would add, Ed, we all can show 40%, 50%, 70% internal rates of return on an incremental well. And we've all got that, anybody that's got a large North American position has got that in their portfolio today. We've got it a go-go; but as Al said, we're not going to drill into the face of $40 headwinds. It's not going anywhere. It just doesn't make any sense.","Ed Westlake","My second question is maybe esoteric and maybe we'll have to leave it to the Analyst Day. But I don't know if you've done any work on just how large a noncore asset disposal program could be, if investors were still unhappy even with the $25 billion debt target that you've laid out, if they felt that really the right gearing for a volatile oil market is actually lower than the gearing targets that you've laid out. I presume there's lots of tax impacts on old assets and a whole load of things that you'd have to think about. But I'm just trying to get a sense of the size of the hopper that's available for disposals if you did want to reduce debt through that volatile period.","Ryan Lance","Yes, we'll probably speak to that more a little bit in November, Ed. We continue to watch the macro and continue to look at what competes for investment in the portfolio. And then, as you say, there's other considerations. Can we get the value? Can we get the value we think we have with holding? We know our assets really well. And we have a view on the macro, and we have a view what's full value being paid for the assets. So we've demonstrated that we'll sell things that don't compete in the portfolio. We're going to continue to do that, and we'll provide you more in November.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Ryan, thinking of the November Analyst Meeting, it seems fairly clear to us that shareholders really want you to do what you're doing in terms of lowering costs and breakevens. But really commit to no growth and all buyback is an overriding strategy. You're referencing it, but you're keeping the growth option open. Can you just talk a little bit about why you don't just go down the route that I believe -- and maybe I'm wrong -- most shareholders would prefer you to? Thank you.","Ryan Lance","Yes, thanks, Paul. We do get that question from you and maybe two others. It is -- that's a good way when we look at it. Again, we recognize that through an up cycle or through the -- as this commodity price recovers a little bit we'll start generating a fair amount of free cash flow. So what do we do with it? And how much of that should go to the shareholder and how much should go to the portfolio? I'd say shareholders in the company -- and you know what our portfolio looks like; we'll show you more of that in November. And not only have we reduced the breakeven costs within the company. We've made some fairly substantial progress reducing the cost of supply in the portfolio within the company as well.","So when you look at those opportunities to invest in the portfolio that are going to move our returns, they're going to add margin and create more cash flow growth for the company, even at a flat, fairly low price deck, we think those are things that we ought to be investing at in the company. And we've got to demonstrate that to you. We've got to show you, and that's our plan to go do that. But I will say we're not trying to compete on growth. Investors have better -- they may have different places to go with their investment if that's what they want. We're going to show you why we can compete on returns; why that makes sense; yet we're not going to forget about the shareholder and make sure an appropriate amount is going to them off the top.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, Ryan; that's reasonable. You guys are really helpful on the macro. Can you observe globally why decline rates haven't been as high, given your global portfolio? It would be just interesting to hear, given your own portfolio hasn't been declining as fast as we thought. What's your perspective on what's going on, why we aren't seeing more declines than we anticipated? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Al Hirshberg","You know, I think that certainly if you look at U.S. production we have seen a big decline. The U.S. is off over 1 million barrels a day from the peak last year. But I think that particularly in the unconventional, the surprise factor is that some people pronounced about a year ago that there was an asymptote coming and that technology had reached its end in the unconventional. And I think we're proving once again that that's not the case, that there's still more cost to be driven out and there's still more increased recoveries to be found through new ideas from new technologies.","So I think we've still got a long way to go there, and so you'll continue to see that. In terms of the rest of the world, I think in our case there are some better reservoir performance that we've experienced in various places. We've had better facility performance in places like APLNG. We've had timing of a pipeline commission in KBB.","So it's been a variety of different things that have been, driven the timing for us. But the main real performance surprise, the biggest single item for us is in the Lower 48 unconventional.","Ryan Lance","I would add, Paul, to that, internationally there's just a number of projects that have continued to come online that were funded in the last three to four years. And our experience is they are not lagging on schedule anymore. They're coming on, and they're coming on usually at better performance than what we were predicting. We're seeing that in our portfolio, whether it's drilling in the UK or Norway, or projects in Malaysia. Or as Al said, Alaska; we're seeing better performance there. And then APLNG, our train at APLNG and the rest of the trains, frankly, that are using our technology on Curtis Island are well outperforming their nameplate capacity and they are running really well. So we're seeing those pockets that are happening. And it's a bit more of a lag in the international space. But the capital investment I think will catch up internationally. We're just seeing some of those projects come online.","Paul Sankey","Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paul. Folks, we're at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question and then, by all means, feel free to follow up with IR after the fact. Christine, one more.","Operator","Our last question is from James Sullivan, of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan","Hey. Good afternoon now decisively, guys. Just wanted to ask a question melding your view on the macro. And it's not another cut at the same question about growth and share buybacks, but do you guys have a threshold to materiality, given that we're not necessarily going to be looking at oodles of free cash flow necessarily, but maybe smaller tranches of free cash flow if we're at $50 or $55 in a year or two? Do you guys have a threshold of materiality for a shareholder buyback, or how do you think about that?","Ryan Lance","Well, yes. I mean as I tried to say, I think as we generate free cash flow we'd like to at least at a minimum do some anti dilutionary share buybacks to offset the cost of our employee based stock ownership plans. So that sets a bit of a floor. Then depending on where, what level of free cash flow we have available, we'll start delivering that to the shareholder. And then we'd like to be in that range of 20% to 30% of our cash flow going to the shareholders, so we'll target that range and look at where we're trading in the marketplace to make sure it makes sense relative to the other options we have.","James Sullivan","Okay, great. So first, that anti dilution, but really you don't necessarily have, I mean it's got to be a billion? in or anything like that in terms of?","Ryan Lance","No, we're at the 20% to 30%, so that's what we've tried to tell everybody and signal that that's the range we'd like to be in, in terms of total returns to the shareholder including our ordinary dividend.","James Sullivan","Great. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications, for final remarks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Great. Thank you, Christine. Thanks to our listeners. Appreciate your time and attention and look forward to seeing you in November. And by all means, if you have questions at all during the rest of the day, feel free to ring IR. Thanks a ton and talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP-Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Christine, and good morning everybody. Again, thank you for joining our First Quarter Earnings Call. Our speakers for today will be Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Hirshberg, our Executive Vice President of Production, Drilling and Projects. Ryan will cover the company level comments, Don will then review the quarterly financials and Al will review the operational highlights for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.","Before we start, I wanted to let all of you know that we have set a date of November 10, 2016, for our analyst and investor meeting, this year's analyst and investors meeting. The event will be held in New York and we will provide some additional details soon, we just wanted to make you got that on your calendars.","Finally, we will make some forward-looking statements this morning. The risks and uncertainties in our future performance have been described on page two of today's presentation as well as in our periodic filings with the SEC. And of course that information, in addition to some supplemental data for today's earnings, can be found on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ellen, and thanks to all for joining the call today. Before I jump into the quarterly results, I want to make some general comments about the company and the environment that we find ourselves in today.","On the next couple of slides, I'll address how ConocoPhillips is positioning to create value as an independent E&P company. I'll describe our value proposition and how we'll compete in a world of lower mid-cycle and more volatile prices. I'll also describe how we're prioritizing our business activities in the short term, the medium term and the long term. I think it's important for investors to know how we're thinking about the current environment, but also how we have positioned the company for strong performance when prices recover. So if you please turn to slide four, we'll get started.","We believe that our value proposition lies in the combination of our unique portfolio attributes and our capital allocation principles. Let me start with the left side of this slide. Underlying our value proposition is a portfolio that we think is quite unique among E&Ps. We've listed several attributes that distinguish our asset base. We have a diverse, relatively low decline base production. We expect our decline rate to moderate somewhat over the next few years as we bring on additional tranches of low to no decline oil sands and LNG projects.","Growth will come from investments in our large low cost to supply resource base. We continue to analyze and calibrate this resource base as we believe it holds profitable investment inventory to keep flat production or grow modestly for well over a decade. Within this captured resource base, we have a mix of flexible short cycle projects and lower risk medium cycle investment projects. We see a roll for both of these types of assets in our portfolio. And finally, the key to being successful in a cyclical business is to have a sustained low cost structure.","Now, on the right side of this slide, are the capital allocation principles that describe our value proposition. Conceptually, the principles are similar to the ones we had at the time of the spin, namely, give cash back to shareholders, maintaining strong investment grade balance sheet and exercise disciplined growth. Obviously, these elements have been reset, but this is still how we expect to deliver returns to the shareholders. Now let me go through these principles.","We reset the dividend, but we still intend to return a meaningful portion of our cash back to our shareholders through a cash dividend. In February, we set the dividend at a level that we believe can be sustained through the price cycles, but that also results in a competitive yield compared to the broad market, as well as to the E&Ps. The dividend will remain a core part of our offering and we are targeting annual, real growth in that dividend going forward.","We remain committed to have a strong investment grade balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of a strong balance sheet. We've set a target to get our debt to less than $25 billion. The pace of that debt reduction will depend on prices and asset sales progress, but de-levering is a top priority as we come out of the downturn.","We have positioned the company to compete on financial returns. So despite having a large low cost to supply portfolio, we won't grow for growth's sake. We'll continue to be very disciplined about how we allocate our growth capital. We're in a strong position to do that as we come to the end of a significant major project investment phase.","You'll notice that we're stating that our growth could be on an absolute or per share basis. Again, financial returns are at the core of our value proposition. If we get the returns right, the rest will follow, and we're committed to getting the returns right.","So the way we think about creating value through the cycles is to have clear principles that align with a competitive portfolio to generate strong returns for the shareholders. One without the other is not sufficient and we believe we have both. We believe we have a sound value proposition, but what also matters is how we are executing our value proposition for the short, medium and long term and it's important to be disciplined across all three time horizons, especially coming out this price downturn. Now, I'll cover this on the next slide.","First, the short term. For us, it's all about defending against low prices in 2016 and 2017. In the first quarter, we raised $4.6 billion of low-cost debt. We announced this morning that we're further cutting 2016 capital from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion. We reset the dividend for the lower end of the price cycle. We have strong liquidity, including about $5 billion of cash on hand at the end of first quarter.","We think we took the right short-term steps to protect against an extended period of weak prices. At the same time, we're staying disciplined and continuing to safely execute our operating plan. And Al will provide more details about that in a moment. But we're running well and our key projects are on track.","Finally, we're focused on lowering the breakeven cost of the business. Now for perspective, if we were in a steady-state world of sustained $45 per barrel oil prices, we believe we could cover the capital required to maintain flat production and pay our dividend with cash from operations.","Now, this steady state for us comes after completion of our major projects and a reallocation of capital to our low cost to supply conventional and unconventional portfolio. This positions us to accelerate performance as prices improve in the medium-term. Debt reduction will be a priority and we'll target growing the dividend on a real annual basis.","We remain focused on safely executing the business. We'll complete several major projects in the medium term, then we'll wrap up production from those projects. Finally, when prices start to recover, it will be important to stay diligent our cost efforts.","Our long-term goal is to execute predictable performance in a world of lower, more volatile prices. We can do this by achieving our target debt level and striving to maintain cash flow neutrality. Now, we define cash flow neutrality as CapEx for flat production, plus our dividend, equals cash from operations. As we generate cash in excess of cash flow neutrality, we have choices about how to allocate those funds. We can return cash to shareholders through share repurchases or we could fund more investments in our low cost to supply resource base.","Growth CapEx will compete with distributions to shareholders. That means we're not setting a target for absolute growth because we're willing to grow on a per-share basis if that makes more sense. We'll continue to high-grade the portfolio and those proceeds will be allocated to debt reduction, distributions and CapEx.","We could also choose to keep additional cash on hand, especially if we thought another low price cycle was approaching. The decisions on how we allocate the cash flows will be based on staying disciplined, achieving the best returns and maximizing value for shareholders.","Now certainly, the last 18 months have really brought home some fundamentals for how to thrive in a cyclical business. We believe it's essential to have a high degree of capital flexibility, a low cost to supply portfolio, best in class cost structure and a strong balance sheet. Most of all, you have to be disciplined. The way to win in a cyclical business is to have a low cost of supply portfolio and to be the most resilient when prices are low and the most disciplined when prices are high.","Now, I hope these short comments were helpful, but on slide six I will summarize the results for the quarter. The left column recaps the strategic actions that I've just described. The middle column captures our operational highlights and Al will discuss those in a bit more detail. We met our goals in and our important capital programs are progressing well.","The right column summarizes the financial results for the quarter. And there's no getting around it, it was a very weak quarter, financially. Underlying performance on the things we can control, like operating costs, was strong, but the bottom line was a large adjusted net loss that clearly reflected the weak commodity price environment.","So now, let me turn the call of the Don for a few comments on our financial results.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on slide eight. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally, but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion, or $0.95 per share, with realized prices down 20% sequentially and 38% year-over-year.","First quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. Our segment-adjusted earnings are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail. The only notable item to call out this quarter is in the lower 48, where earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million, as a result of a dry hole at the Melmar prospect in the Gulf of Mexico.","A couple of other items of note, while we have lowered capital guidance, we are not changing any other guidance items at this time. This includes operating expense, which ran light to expectations this quarter. We expect to give you an update at midyear.","Also, we've updated our sensitivities in the appendix of this deck. We changed Henry Hub to reflect the impact of last year's asset sales and WTI to reflect production decline in the lower 48, due to reduced drilling activity.","Turning to slide nine, I'll cover production. First quarter production averaged 1.578 million BOE per day, which was the upper end of guidance, reflecting increased ramp at APLNG and better performance across the portfolio. Last year's first quarter volumes were 1.61 million BOE per day, but after adjusting for dispositions, first quarter 2015 volumes would be 1.54 million BOE per day. As a reminder, the majority of those dispositions were natural gas properties, so as a result, North American gas represents only 19% of our overall production this quarter, compared to 24% in the year ago period.","Continuing through the waterfall and netting out the differences in downtime, we saw an underlying increase of 34,000 BOE per day, or 2%. That increase came primarily from APLNG gas and Canadian bitumen, partly offset by a decline North American gas. This gets you to 1.578 million BOE per day of production for the quarter, so underlying performance is strong.","If you turn to slide 10, I'll cover the cash flows during the quarter. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and generated $700 million from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was an offset of about $400 million in the first quarter, but we expect it to be a wash for the full year.","During the quarter, we received about $100 million of net proceeds from dispositions. Net debt increased by $4.5 billion, and capital spending for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which we expect to be the high watermark for the year. After dividend payments of $300 million, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.","It was a tough quarter financially, but we ended the quarter with a significant amount of cash on hand and strong liquidity to manage through the price environment. We can't do much about prices, but the key is to continue executing the business well and we're doing that, as you'll now hear from Al.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on slide 12.","In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. That's down 15,000 barrels per day, or 3%, compared to our first quarter production last year, once you adjust for asset sales. The reduction is primarily due to our reduced rig count last year, which is impacting our production this year.","We further exercised our capital flexibility in the Lower 48 and dropped down to three operated rigs in April, and we plan stay at that level through 2016. Now that said, even with the lower rig count, we are continuing to realize strong efficiencies in the Eagle Ford and Bakken and we'll keep leveraging technology and working with our vendors to improve performance and capture deflation where possible.","In exploration, the non-operated Gibson well is currently drilling. However, that's the last exploration well that we plan to drill in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In this price environment, we don't feel it's prudent to continue allocating capital to new deepwater prospects, so we no longer plan to drill Horus or Socorro, which we had planned to drill with the Maersk Valiant drill ship. By the way, these changes account for about half of our 2016 capital reduction from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion that Ryan referred to earlier.","Looking at Canada, our production was 293,000 barrels per day; that's an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2015 production of 288,000 after adjusting for dispositions. The increase is driven mostly by improved well performance in Western Canada and ramp up at Surmont 2. In the past year, we've increased our bitumen production by 6% and reduced underlying gas production by 3%. But when you include asset sales, though, gas is down 23%, so we've significantly changed our production mix in Canada.","So moving over to slide 13, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. These regions have many of our legacy assets that still compete for capital. As you can see, the low cost of supply projects we brought online over the last couple of years are beginning to offset natural declines.","In Alaska, we're seeing favorable results from our CD5 and drill site 2S projects, which both started up in the fourth quarter of last year and are contributing to a 3% production increase over the first quarter of 2015. We also just approved an additional phase at CD5, which will bring more wells online in late 2017. We're starting activity at GMT1, which was sanctioned at the end of 2015, and is expected to come online in late 2018.","In Europe, production is also up 3% versus the first quarter of 2015, and we have several more projects underway which are expected to start up over the next couple of years. In late 2015, we successfully took over operatorship at Britannia, which was previously operated by a joint venture. We're seeing cost savings from this action and it's a good example of efficiency improvements that we've been able to implement.","Slide 14 covers our last two segments, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International. I APME, production is up 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 10% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ramp up at APLNG. Train one is running well and ramped up more quickly than anticipated with 11 cargoes loaded in the first quarter. And as of earlier this week, we've actually now loaded 15 cargoes at APLNG.","In Malaysia, we're ramping up the Gumusut after starting up the gas and water injection and we're continuing to progress the Malikai project, which should start producing next year. As the Other International segment is exploration focused, the main news for the quarter is from Senegal, where we completed several successful appraisal wells and drill stem tests to further evaluate this new play-opening discovery.","So, Ryan started the call with details of our value proposition and strategy and then Don covered the financial results. If you'll turn to slide 15, I'll wrap up with our operational outlook of the year.","While we continue to focus on lowering capital and reducing costs, we're committed to safely delivering on our operational commitments. As we previously guided, we expect our 2016 production to be essentially flat to 2015 when you exclude the full year effects of asset sales. This result is driven by some decline in the Lower 48 unconventionals as we continue to exercise our capital flexibility there, offset by growth in the other segments.","In the second quarter, production is expected to be between 1.5 million and 1.54 million barrels per day. The reduction from first quarter is a result of major turnaround activity we had planned, primarily in Europe. Turnaround activity will continue into the third quarter, mostly in Europe and Alaska. By the fourth quarter, we expect production to increase as our major turnarounds are completed.","We're continuing to ramp up at Surmont 2 in Canada and have ongoing project developments in Alaska, Europe, and Asia-Pacific that will also add to production. Finally, in Australia, we expect to deliver the first cargo from APLNG Train 2 in the fourth quarter of this year.","So, the price environment continues to be challenging, but as always, we'll continue to focus on the things we can control \u2013 delivering best in class safety performance, bringing our projects online, on time, and on budget, and meeting or exceeding our operating targets.","So now, I'll turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Let me start off with a macro question. On the last call you talked about potentially adding rigs into 2017 in the lower 48. I know it's a complicated formula, but is there a threshold commodity price that you need to see to add in 2017, given spending and deleveraging objectives? How do you think about that?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Evan, this is Al. I will take that one. I guess, first I should say that as I said earlier, we don't have any plans to add any rigs beyond the three that we're running in the lower 48 in 2016. And of course, we haven't set our 2017 budget yet, so haven't determined how many we would run there. But overall, I would say that there is no set spot price that we're trying to watch as a trigger to start adding back activity. We'll be looking at the entire macro environment, looking at supply and demand fundamentals of whether we think that any price action that we get is actually sustainable or not.","And then as prices do come back, our first priority is going to be to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce our debt. And then even after that, we recognize that adding capital for organic growth is going to have to compete with other things on our list, like for example, per share growth. So, we're not in a hurry to say there's some price trigger where we're going to add back capital.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So I think as a follow-up, I think in 3Q you mentioned you need 16 rigs to hold unconventional production flat, and now you're at three. What's your implied decline, unconventional decline or lower 48 decline, sorry, in your guidance?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yes, if you look at the overall decline for say full-year 2016 to full-year 2015, we expect it to come in around 10% with the rigs that we are running \u2013 with the three rigs.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I have to say I love the per share focus, Ryan. A couple of question, if I may, around that. First of all, on the debt metrics, do you have some kind of measure you're using, whether it be net debt to capital or EBITDA coverage or something like that, that you're aiming to get to in terms of \u2013 because I think Jeff had said in the last call that you were happy around $25 billion. Obviously, it's a little higher than that now, so is their some framework that you can give us at to where you want the balance sheet to get to before you perhaps embark upon buybacks?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, let me ask \u2013 Don's got some comments there, Doug \u2013 if you could?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Yes, Doug, we're trying to send a very clear message that we don't want to be carrying balance sheet debt of nearly $30 billion. And so, this is the reason why we set a very clear, specific goal to bring that down to below $25 billion. We think for a company our size and diversity, we're comfortable with the coverage provided across a range of mid-cycle prices with that level of debt.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So there's no specific metric like an EBITDA multiple or something like that you're targeting?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","No, we're targeting going down to a specific debt level, and that sort of has an implied debt to cash flow type multiple, depending on what sort of mid-cycle price you want to look at.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you. My follow-up is I think, Ryan, there's still \u2013 or maybe Don \u2013 there's still probably some confusion around what your sensitivity looks like to the commodity. I mean, in your appendix of your slide deck, you're sticking with earnings sensitivities. I wonder if I could ask you just to walk us through what happens at the cash flow level, assuming there is some kind of recovery in the commodity at some point?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Yes, sure, Doug. I think, obviously, that these product prices that we're at now, we are not in a tax-paying position. So the sensitivities as you would've applied them a few years ago to try to convert from net income to cash flow, no longer apply. So the simplest guidance that I can give you is just take those net income sensitivities and gross them up for the tax impact. So, if you divide by 0.6, then that will make a conversion, as long as we're not in a taxpaying position.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","When does \u2013 up to what level \u2013 is that like up to $60 level? Can you frame that for us?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","It's not \u2013 this is a very complex question because we are operating in so many different tax jurisdictions \u2013 and it depends a lot on the price path that you take to get to that number. It's going to be different all across the company, but I think in general terms, $60 is probably a pretty good guess overall for the corporation.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, on the reduction in capital spending, I think you called out a couple of items in the quarter, but just wanted to make sure I got all of it. So the drivers that got you down to $5.7 billion from the $6.4 billion, if you could just help us walk through that? And then, does that impact the way you think about the $6 billion you need to keep production flat in a $60 world?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Okay. The 0.7 billion of reduction, just about half of that as I mentioned earlier comes from the reduction that we're taking earlier on deepwater Gulf of Mexico by have not drilling Horus and Socorro. The next biggest item after that, actually, is additional deflation beyond what we had already assumed in our numbers. And then beyond that, it's all smaller things around the world in different places, APLNG, China, Indonesia with some small reductions. APLNG is a joint venture because we've got some extra cargoes over what we'd anticipated because the plant's running so well. That extra revenue has us putting a little less cash in there.","So it's smaller things like that that add up to the rest of that to get us to that $5.7 billion. So none of those things are going to have any impact on 2016 production, and only a very tiny impact on 2017 production, some those small deferrals.","As far as the way you think about how much CapEx it takes to stay flat, the only thing on that list that might impact that a bit is just the deflation. We're still in that $5 billion to $6 billion range of what it's going to take to stay flat. Over a long period of time \u2013 Ryan talked about 10 plus years in our resource base that we \u2013 in a $5 billion to $6 billion real kind of capital per year that we can hold production flat.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At the kind of prices that you quoted, Neil.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Right.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And then, I know as part of the work that you're doing into the Analyst Day, you're doing an economic analysis to figure out the cost of supply and the returns of different parts of your portfolio. Could you just talk a little bit about how shale competes relative to some of the other non-OPEC projects outside the U.S., as you think about where it is best to deploy capital, both on the cost of supply but then also on a cycle of time basis?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I think we referred to that a bit in my opening comments. We really have been working pretty hard to position the portfolio over the last couple of years into shorter cycle time investments. And when we look at the cost of supply across our portfolio, the things that we think compete really well against any investments globally around the world are some of our conventional legacy investments around China, Alaska, Norway, U.K., Malaysia; and then our unconventional investments, which I think was more the point of your question, around the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. While they could have a gross wide range of cost of supply, if you're in the best rocks like we are and the positions that we are, those cost of supplies are very competitive with anything that we've got or any non-OPEC kind of investments that you referred to around the world today.","So we'll talk a bit more about that in the analyst meeting that Ellen referred to coming up to show you, even within our portfolio, there's a range of cost of supplies around each asset, but we're getting to the place where we understand that very well, so we can make sure that we are very disciplined in terms of how we allocate the capital to the highest returning, lowest cost supply assets in the portfolio.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great, Ryan. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question was, I think, a follow-up to Evan's question where you're talking about reinvestment. And I think in the last call you talked about roughly $2 billion of roll-off spend from 2016 to 2017 that could be used to reinvest and potentially keep production flat, but you also mentioned now that you're not in a hurry to add rigs and unconventionals. So, I was just trying the square those two items and how we should be thinking about that flexible capital. I assume that flexible capital also steps down a little because you pulled some of that forward with the deepwater decision this quarter.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yep, Phil. That's exactly right. The $2 billion is what we were talking about before and with the step down, that number is now about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, it's in that range of roll-off from 2016 to 2017, so that's still there. You can roughly think of that about that about $1 billion of it is from APLNG and FCCL and about $0.5 billion from the deepwater.","But then there are some offsets in our base plan. We have some of these mid-cycle sized projects that we have executing that are going to be bringing us volumes over the next few years that are in a phase in their life where their capital is actually going to be increasing 2016 to 2017, and that's close to $1 billion. So that's things like a Bohai Phase 3 in China, Clair Ridge, GMT1, 1H NEWS, Aasta Hansteen. Some of those kind of mid-sized projects are going to use some of that. That still leaves on the order of $0.5 billion dollars of additional flexibility that we will have. But at the end of the day, we're still \u2013 expect that between $5 billion and $6 billion is what it would take to hold production flat over the coming years.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. My follow-up is with respect to the balance sheet piece that you're talking about, $25 billion target, I assume over time. You also have a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet. So I was just trying to understand minimum cash requirements and roughly how quickly in a stripped case, you feel like you could get to that $25 billion target? Do you have a goal around that?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Well, this is a medium-term priority that we see occurring over time as prices recover. We do have a good cash balance; we're looking at using some of our cash balances to reduce our debt balances and you may see some of that activity as early as the current quarter. And then come October this year, we've got a maturity of about $1.25 billion, and so that will provide another opportunity, but that's something that we'll look at later in the year, and that'll depend quite a bit on our financial position at the time, how much leverage we're comfortable carrying and probably most importantly, our outlook on product prices over the short term, over the next year or so.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. I had two questions, I guess both really on shareholder returns. The first on, I guess, getting back down to that targeted debt level. Once we do get to free cash flow neutrality and then really in excess cash flow, is it fair to think that the primary target will be reducing debt over and above shareholder returns, vis-\u00e0-vis dividend increases and or buybacks?","And then I guess the second question, I will go ahead and ask them both. Are there any specific metrics you're going to be evaluating on buybacks versus reinvesting into the business? I guess I'm trying to get a sense is to if this is going to be a ratable type of program or more opportunistic depending on where the equity price sits at the time?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Blake. Maybe I'll take the first one. I think when you look at what we've kind of set as priorities, we've got clearly in the medium term, we need to get the balance sheet repaired and back down to the target levels that Don described. But at the same time, we think we're going to target annual real increases to the dividend at the same time. I mean, to put that in perspective, a 3%, 4%, 5% dividend increase is less than $60 million. So I think we're going to \u2013 that will be important to us to demonstrate that as well as we're going forward.","So, we'll be targeting some of those annual returns to the shareholder through the dividend channel and also reducing the debt as we come out of an area where we're generating free cash, or we've reached that point of cash flow neutrality that you referred to. Now, as we get that free cash and we think about it, what we've said is we're just going to be really judicious about allocating the capital. We'll make sure that per share growth competes with organic growth that we have in the portfolio. I think we'll probably, maybe a bit less ratable, we'll try to be a bit more opportunistic around that.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Here in Houston, still anyway. Quick question for you on the OpEx side, obviously ahead of pace, Q1 not changing target for the full year, and kind of coming with some of the questions asked earlier about oil prices recovery, you start maybe spending more on CapEx, reducing debt. What is your outlook for the OpEx side? Is this a sustainable level or is there an inflation that's got to come back or some deferrals that are likely to hit in 2017 or 2018 that won't occur in 2016?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Okay. Roger, I'll take that one. First, just remind us where we've been. Go back to just one year ago in April of 2015 at our Analyst Day, we were talking about being at $9.7 billion of OpEx in 2014, and we set a $1 billion reduction target. And we beat that in 2015 by coming down $1.7 billion down to $8 billion. And then we've taken another $1 billion out in our target for 2016, and as you correctly point out, if you look at the first quarter number and multiply by four, you get a number that's less than $6.5 billion. So, we were on a really good pace in the first quarter.","Our operating and our technical teams and our supply chain folks have really been successful at driving out cost. And the focus in all that work, as you were kind of hinting at, has been on sustainability, finding sustainable reductions, structural reductions while also capturing as much of the cyclical as we can, even though we know we'll have to give some of that back at the end of the day.","So I, frankly, I do expect to beat $7 billion this year. But we've got these turnaround season coming. There's also the Horus and Socorro decision and that rig was going to be on CapEx, and we'll have about an incremental $100 million of OpEx as we have a stacked rig there. And so, our organization is going to continue working. We've got a lot of work going on to continue to work on OpEx, and I expect that we'll beat that number. But really at midyear, I think we'll be ready to update where we're going to land.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then my other question, asset sales, obviously not much in Q1, everybody knows about the giant backlog out there, but any progress at all you can hint towards for this year?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I'll take it, Roger. I think we said throughout the years, we ought to be able to invest $1 billion to $2 billion. We'll probably be on the lower end of that. I think what we showed in the first quarter was $100 million, and I think we're pretty close to doubling that as we look forward, kind of over the next quarter in terms of things we got in the process to close, but probably be the lower end of that. We pulled some assets off the market where we're not getting what we think is fair value for it. But there are a few more assets that we still have on the market that we're hopeful around. So I think will be at more than what we showed, certainly in the first quarter, but we may not hit the full $1 billion mark that we're \u2013 what we were trying to hit at the beginning of the year. The market's just softened quite a lot, as you described.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","I was off for a few minutes and so if you covered my question, just let me know. First I think, Ryan and Al made it pretty clear that there's going to be a shift in emphasis away from growth and towards returns on capital with distributions to shareholders important too, although that's always been the case for you guys. So, my question is whether the company plans to use specific metrics such as capital expenditures, preemptive shareholder distribution or some other metric that you deem important to manage to the objectives over the next couple of years, and just to ensure that the capital management plan is kept within the boundaries. Or put another way, the question is really how in practice will you execute this plan and keep us abreast of the progress? How are you thinking about that?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Doug, I guess probably not a real precise formula in how you go through that. A lot depends on how fast from the slope of the recovery as we go forward, how quickly we can get the balance sheet down to the target levels that we're talking about. But I think what we tried to describe to people is we, as the price does turn and we get above sort of a breakeven price, we start generating that free cash flow. What we've said is we think we ought to be investing in short and medium cycle projects; we ought to be real returns back to, annually, real returns back to the shareholder through the dividend channel and then just paying pretty close attention to where the stock is trading in the marketplace, how we think, is it an undervalued stock so we can look at the returns that we might get on a per share basis and compare that to the constant supply and the opportunity to invest in the organic side of the portfolio.","We've got a pretty deep inventory of things to choose from, but know we've got a range of constant supply sitting in that portfolio as well. But we probably won't have an exact formula. We won't make a declaration about how we're doing it, but we will certainly report how we're doing that quarterly to you.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Well, I think better balance would be welcomed by the market for everybody, so I think that's good news. And then also, Ryan, in Canada, I wanted to get your insight into the opportunity that you see from the solvent technology that's begun to become available, meaning, is this something that you guys are optimistic about for your portfolio? Are you employing it already? What do you think the opportunity is there for the company?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's part of our effort to get constant supply in the oil sands down to something that's competitive in the portfolio. I can probably let, Al might have more detail on that, more current detail, anyways. But in either case, Doug, we plan to provide a lot more detail about that in November. But I'll let Al jump in as well.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","I think you've probably seen some things out there in the industry being talked about around that technology, Doug. We're excited about it also. We call our version of eSAGD and we have run a few pilots going back quite a few years to try to optimize the way we use that technology and it definitely works. It's a methodology to lower your steam oil ratio and also to thereby reduce your greenhouse gas emissions per barrel of production, and so it's got a lot of attractiveness to it.","One of the key variables is just the solvent recovery and how much of that solvent do you get back versus having to put more into the ground. And that's somewhere where we've had our focus. But I think we'll probably have an opportunity to address where we see that headed, that technology along with some others, at our analyst day in November.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great, Al. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you, guys, very much for taking my question. Al, you highlighted that you, you highlighted the declines for the U.S. unconventional volumes. With another quarter under your belt, now running at three rigs, your latest view on deflation capture and efficiencies, do you have an updated view as to the level of capital or the amount of rigs you would need to redeploy into the U.S. to reverse that decline and to begin to grow that production?","And along those lines, with the activity reductions that have taken place for you, the head count that we've lost more broadly across the service sector, can you just discuss for us the lead times that may be developing for you to begin to pivot from reducing rigs back to increasing activity levels? And how do you think about preserving that flexibility to ramp up over time?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Well, I should've written all those questions down. I'll try to catch them all. Well, first, on supply chain, let me just mention our overall progress there. We talked at our analyst day a year ago about trying to get $1 billion \u2013 that's both CapEx of OpEx \u2013 of supply chain savings. And we did achieve just a little over that in 2015 of deflation savings, CapEx and OpEx, from our supply chain. And then we set a target for ourselves for this year to get another $1 billion. And so far, we're on track for that. If you look at actually captured deflation savings in 2016 for us in the first quarter, it was $300 million; that's CapEx and OpEx.","So we're on track there, and in fact, are starting to think about our window of opportunity for locking in some of these prices for longer periods of time going forward, as we think about what our cost structure is going to look like as things start to come back.","In terms of the rigs that we need, let me just talk about, say, the rigs that we need to hold flat. So we're down the three rigs in the Lower 48 right now. We would need to get back up 12 to 13 rigs, somewhere in that range, in order to just get back to holding our production flat, and a number higher than that to start growing our production again.","We have retained the capability amongst our staff to be able to do that, and so, from our internal standpoint, we could do it relatively quickly if that's what we chose to do. From an external standpoint, obviously, there has been a lot of loss of both hardware capability and people capability amongst our contracting community. And so, I think the first leg of returning some rigs back to work is going to be something that can be done in a fairly short amount of time, but similar to us, where we go from 3 to 12 or 13 to hold flat, well, to go to that even bigger number to grow, if the whole industry's trying to do that at once, I don't think that capacity's going to be there. And so, it'll have to be built up over time, and I can see that being north of the year, a one to two year kind of timeframe to really build that kind of capacity back. In other words, I don't think U.S. unconventional production could go back up as fast as it came down, or is coming down still.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Yeah, no that's \u2013 thanks for those comments, Al. And then my second question, even though the first one, I guess, had multiple parts, is the view now that longer cycle time greenfield projects are no longer necessary for Conoco to hold the production flattish longer-term through the cycle at that $5 billion to $6 billion of CapEx?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yeah, that's exactly right. That is one of the conclusions that we've reached is that as we look into that deep set of resource base, low-cost of supply \u2013 we're going to show you more about this in November, just how much that cost of supply has come down. It's dramatically lower than the cost of supply numbers that we showed you last April. And so, it gives us that deep bench of anywhere from shorter cycle to medium cycle sort of sized projects that allows us as we look out well over a decade to hold production flat in this $5 billion to $6 billion kind of range without needing any mega projects or long cycle projects to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, Paul.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Ryan, I think that I have two questions. The first one is probably for Don and Ryan. In terms of your medium-term target for the debt reduction, $25 billion, I'm just curious, given the industry, it seems like every time when we have a major downturn, the industry is caught by surprise. At $25 billion, certainly at a reasonable oil price environment, you are more than comfortable to handle it, but given that our ability to predict the turn of the cycle is close to zero, or at least that's the track record. So should we target the debt reduction to be significantly more than that? And in the sense that you position yourself, if indeed, we got caught by surprise and had a major downturn, not only you won't be getting into any financial distress, but you also could take the opportunity to be a buyer and not a seller.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, Paul, yeah, I mean, we're going to be looking at all those items. So when we say less than $25 billion, that's exactly some of the thoughts that are on our mind is, how do you prepare for the next down cycle? Because we think we need to set up the company to be successful in a lower mid-cycle price with more volatility.","The added comment to the balance sheet piece is certainly, we'll be watching that and trying to decide, but we're setting ourselves up with a lot of capital flexibility in these shorter cycle time projects, so it's not just \u2013 there's going to be other ways to manage the cash. And at the end of the day, once we hit free cash flow, we've got a lot of choices about how to allocate that free cash flow, some of the which may be keeping cash on the balance sheet and preparing. So, it's about net debt. It's not just the balance sheet debts there, but yeah, we're going to be trying to factor that all in, in conjunction with our, both our short and longer-term outlook on commodity prices.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A second one, real quick. I mean, in the past you provided what is the Eagle Ford and Bakken production. I just wanted to see whether you would be able to provide that for the first quarter? And also the split between oil and gas in those production?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yeah, I guess the first quarter production at Eagle Ford was 168,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. I don't know if you've got the split.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Paul, I can come back to you on that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not sure we have the split at our fingertip, Paul.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","I don't have it at my finger, but I'll get back to you on that, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Good morning. I guess we'll be dealing with this maintenance CapEx question again. I mean, I can see how you have spent a lot of money on these long-life projects which tend to have higher upfront CapEx. I can see how shale can be more efficient, I can see how things like Bohai and Aasta Hansteen and then some of the sort of conventional projects would be lower and looking forward to the Analyst Day. But the question I have is around, I guess, how much deflation or inflation have you included in the projection as you go out over time? Because obviously, the market's starting to think oil is going backup. At some point that may mean costs go up. So, maybe just a current comment on deflation in those types of assets as you bid out those projects. And then longer-term, what have you included in your assumptions? Thank you.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yeah, I think that's a very fair point that you're making. Really, I sort of said it early, it probably went by fast, that when we think about this $5 billion to $6 billion over long periods of time to hold production flat, that's a real number. It's $5 billion to $6 billion today if we have inflation, and how that inflation comes back in, it depends on what's happening in the market and the industry, then the nominal number can go up over time. So it's $5 billion to $6 million under today's conditions or low price conditions. In a scenario where we are moving back up, $60s, $70s, $80s on the oil price, that number is going to go up. It's going to reflate.","And so, we've done some estimates on how much of the cost reduction we've got. We think it's structural versus cyclical, but certainly there's a significant cyclical component that will come back as you move back up. Now, on some of these medium cycle projects, the ones you mentioned, those costs are fairly well locked in already, and so they're not going to change with reflation. The place where it will hit us first is in the unconventional North America, just as that was the place where we first captured and most heavily captured deflation. I expect that's where we'll see reflation coming back first.","And so, I also mentioned a minute ago that one of the things that we've been doing to counteract that a bit is in the first quarter, that's when we started to work on locking in pricing for longer periods of time, particularly in the L-48 and the unconventional, where we give up the right to be able to rebid when we think things are going lower but instead lock in the price as things move higher over a longer period of time. Just trying to delay when some of that reflation comes back into our numbers.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, a lot of folks trying to hedge oil prices but they should be trying to hedge costs right now probably. Second question around AP LNG. This may just be lower LNG prices, may be start-up cost but obviously the asset itself is performing well, but when I look at your earnings, obviously everything got worse in Q1 but I thought you might do a little bit better in the quarter. I mean, is there anything that we need to think about in terms of the start-up costs or anything else around that asset?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Well, at APLNG we're still heavy in the construction building Train 2. In fact, we just finished all the final (54:00), et cetera, on Train 1 and now we're pushing and 85% complete on Train 2. It still had a lot of construction work left to do this year, so there's a still a lot of capital going into that. So, that's what's driving the continued capital injection into APLNG. Once we've got the trains both running in you get into the $40s on crude price, say a mid-$40s kind of price, then we'll start to get cash back out from APLNG.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Ryan \u2013 hi, Ryan \u2013 you presented the post-split that ConocoPhillips as having a differentiated model. It was somewhat inherited as a result of the split. As we go into this analyst meeting, what do you feel is going to be the differentiating aspect of ConocoPhillips that you want to promote? That's point one or question one. And then maybe for Ryan or for Al, this time around it feels like we may be, it may be different in so far as most companies are now saying they'll be less likely to commit to very large high upfront cost long-term projects and more likely to use the U.S. unconventional to flex production. How do you think that makes things different when we begin to \u2013 as has been asked many times on this call \u2013 when we think about how costs will inflate or not inflate going forward, and how you can, I guess, differentiate yourself in that respect, too? Thanks.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Paul. I'll take the first part and maybe Al can take the second part there. So, as we are go into this analyst meeting, as I tried say in my opening comments, Paul, I think sort of our disciplined capital approach is still fundamental. We had that at the spin and we'll continue to talk about that. I think the portfolio differentiates itself and as we learn more about the unconventionals, learn more \u2013 the technology, the work that we've done over the last few years \u2013 we just see lower cost of supply and a lot more resilience in that portfolio. So, I think the portfolio will continue to evolve and occupy a big piece of what we talked about.","And then certainly what's different is, while the dividend decision was difficult, probably the most difficult I've had to make, it has reset the company. So we have, I think, we've lowered the break-even for the company when we start to generate free cash flow which is something we didn't have sort of at the spin as we came out of that. It was going to take until these major projects and we got lot through these long cycle time projects, to get up and running before we reached that condition.","That was the case post spin, and that's even more so the case now. And I think what's different now is that a deeper and a better understanding of the low cost of supply that sits in the portfolio today was captured, which kind of informed our deepwater decision as well here about a year ago, which was a tough one at the time, looks better today, obviously, but was certainly a tougher one at the time. But it's been informed by what \u2013 as we've interrogated the portfolio and applied technology to that \u2013 what we can do with the existing captured resource space, and the kind of growth we can see or flat capital for a decade or more just by exercising the options we have in the captured portfolio.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","I guess I would add to what Ron said that one of the things we've seen as we've worked over the last few of years to drive down the cost of supply across our whole resource base, is that we've been differentially successful in doing that in our unconventional, in our oil sands, and even some of our legacy conventional versus deepwater. That's one of the things that's driven our thinking around deepwater is that we haven't been able to drive that \u2013 that cost of supply hasn't \u2013 the structural part of it has been more difficult to drive it down versus, say, unconventional.","Now, regarding your question on how industry comes back in the U.S. on the unconventional side, I don't think we're going to be the only ones thinking that we want to do some debt reduction before we go back to running rigs. So I expect that that along with some of the effects we were talking about earlier, will cause things not to come back up at the same speed that they came down. And of course, there will be that delay effect as well, just as we had on the way down, you'll have that on the way up.","I already mentioned some of the things we're doing on the supply chain side to try to manage our costs on the way up. But I will say, we talked earlier, as we get to a free cash flow position and we're judging whether we want to put some money to organic growth versus per share growth versus other uses of that capital, one of the things we'll be looking at is what the cost is doing. If costs are reflating all the way back to where they were before, then our interest in putting that money back to work in that kind of work is going to be lower. So, we're going to be disciplined in managing those costs, and the pace that we go back to work will partly depend \u2013 the attractiveness of that \u2013 will partly depend on how that reflation works.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just got a couple of clarifications. First, you all obviously talked about the asset sales a little bit, but just to clarify. When you say you're seeing some softness in the market, is that specifically related to your deepwater package you have up for sale? And if I could add on to that the question, Al, you obviously talked about the success in Senegal. Is Senegal still within the deepwater package of stuff you look to sell?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, we're seeing softness really across the board, Scott. And we've said before we're just not going to firesale anything. And we are prepared to continue to appraise and develop if we need to. We still have some things on the market in Indonesia. We still have our deepwater portfolio in pieces on the market as well. So we are still trying to progress that. Again, we know what our hold value is and we know what value it would take to sell the assets.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","With regard to Senegal, we've had a lot of success there finding a new play in the area, and now we've drilled, we're on our fourth appraisal well right now, so we've drilled three appraisal wells, two drill stem tests now on our fourth appraisal well. And we've clearly proved up high-quality reservoirs with good continuity across a large area, and so there's been quite a bit of interest in that asset. And we'll see what happens there, but we've got a continuing appraisal program. It's going to take some more appraisal wells before that one's done, but we'll continue doing whatever appraisal work we need to do to establish the value of that asset.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. And my follow-up question, on the view of obviously focusing on more production per share growth going forward, is there a situation you would envision where it doesn't make sense to maintain production and do share buyback and obviously, let your production base decline? Or is maintenance for production sort of at the minimum threshold and then you're going look with free cash flow to buy back shares if it makes sense?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think there may be periods of time where you don't put enough capital back in to maintain, but I think over time, we want to maintain our production. We don't want to shrink and decline the production. There may be periods of time where some of that happens, but over the long haul, no, we don't want to \u2013 I don't think we want to do that. We'll be looking at what kind of maintenance capital it takes to hold our production flat.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, appreciate that. So it's not a shrink-to-grow type of mentality at all? Got it.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I \u2013 no, Scott. I mean, now, that ex-dispositions, just to be clear. We do have some things in the portfolio that we still want to monetize over time, and I think the size portfolio that we have, we'll be in the market doing some of that just on a natural, constant basis. So all my comments are kind of ex-disposition.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a very \u2013 a couple of little cleanup things here. One is, you guys loaded 11 APLNG cargoes during the quarter, I think you said, and a few more after. Do you have the number that were sold during the quarter?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All of them.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","They were all FOB sales.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. So they're all \u2013 they're all \u2013 so you're taking title as they go onto the ship.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","That's right.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Right. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just this is a little bit more out there, but do you guys have \u2013 and if you don't have the exact number, maybe just what the trend is \u2013 kind of uptime percentage in the North Sea generally? I know you guys put a lot of iron up about two, three years ago over there, but I just wanted to see \u2013 obviously, you guys are doing some infill work there and playing, too. But how has that trended over the last three years in terms of cost absorption and so on and using up that infrastructure?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Cost \u2013 I thought I understood the question until the very end there. I thought you were asking about uptime.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Uptime, yeah. I am thinking about uptime, and the read-through would then just be decreasing cost per unit by utilizing infrastructure...","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yeah, okay. I see. I see. Yeah, I get it. So yeah, we actually \u2013 there's some opposing forces there with some \u2013 we have seen over that period of time in the North Sea an increasing uptime trend. So we've actually been quite pleased with how our facilities have been running there. And that has had an effect in lowering unit cost. But we've also, frankly, have changed our philosophy a bit in a lower price environment where we're not willing to spend as much money to keep every barrel on as we were before, and so that tends to ameliorate that trend a bit. But still, despite that change in philosophy, we've still had an increasing trend. And between that and our other deflation and other cost reduction efforts, have seen a nice decreasing unit cost trend in those assets.","You may recall when we talked about deflation at our Analyst Day last year, we said it was going to happen first in the unconventional, and it was because of the way we contracted; it would take longer to make its way to Europe. And so, we're seeing those supply chain benefits more this year are rolling into our European operations, that we weren't getting as much last year.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. So there actually might be a little bit of non-linear effect as the price comes up and you guys kind of elect to increase uptime then?","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","Yeah, there's \u2013 if price gets up high enough where we're willing to spend those barrels, there is some potential for some non-linearity there. I don't see that as a huge effect, but yes, there's some.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just one for me. This earnings season, every company is being asked the same question. How are your CapEx decisions changing now that we're starting to see a more durable commodity recovery? You guys went, in many ways, kind of the opposite direction, not just a cut but a sizable cut from February levels even though the curve is quite a bit higher. So, what prompted another phase in this reduction against the grain of how the commodity has been moving?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, first, Pavel, it's our decision to get out of deepwater. I mean, that's what pretty much drove those $6.4 billion down to the $5.7 billion. It was half the reduction, and then, is just really monitoring the business as close as we can and dialing it and not wanting to spend any cash to take on anymore on the balance sheet. So, we'll defend the balance sheet and continue to wind down the deepwater program that we announced over a year ago.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. But I guess the intensity of the wind-down has obviously changed just in the last 60 days. So what prompted that?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The intensity of the wind-down?","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, so the pace at which you're cutting deepwater has shifted just since February.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we just made the decision not to drill the last couple of prospects with the Maersk Valiant drillship. So, that's sort of a \u2013 kind of a cliff \u2013 that's not a wind-down sort of scenario. We just got to the point where we just made a decision internally that we weren't going to drill the last couple of prospects. So that was a fairly significant binary decision.","Alan J. Hirshberg - EVP-Production, Drilling & Projects","I mean, the more work we do on our portfolio, improving cost to supply and all the other things I was talking about earlier, the less relative attractiveness that deepwater has for us in our portfolio. And so, ultimately it's that sort of thing that drove us to say why are we going to drill these last two wells? We'll save the money.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Asit Sen of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two quick ones. One on cash margin and second on Canada. So, if I'm looking at your Q1 2016 cash flow per barrel and compare it to potential incremental volumes coming on, so in other words, will the BOEs from Surmont APLNG be accretive to the cash margin? How should we think about that, because I understand the benefit of the decline rate, but on the cash accretion.","And second on Canada, Al, I think you mentioned 6% increase in bitumen production. So, a decent shift in production mix. What does it do to the incremental cash flow profile in a very tough region?","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Well, I'll try to address the question about the volumes coming out of the equity affiliate. So, in this year at these prices and with the capital plans within those equity affiliates, we're actually making cash injections into the equity affiliates. We're not pulling cash out. There are no distributions. So from a margin standpoint, that's not going to be accretive to our consolidated margins.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Got you.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","And what was the second part of your question?","Unknown Speaker","APLNG.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Yeah. That applies to bitumen and to LNG from APLNG.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Donald Evert Wallette - CFO, EVP-Finance & Commercial","Sure.","Ellen R.

DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Christine, and good morning to everybody. Today you'll hear from: Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer, and Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production.","We will be making some forward-looking statements this morning, and our cautionary language is shown on page two. That information can also be found in our periodic filings with the SEC.","We do anticipate a lot of questions today, so we'll limit our questions to one and a follow-up when we get to Q&A.","And now I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan Lance.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ellen. I'm going to let Jeff handle the 2015 recap in his upcoming comments, and I want to jump right into the news we announced today, beginning with slide four.","With today's announcement regarding reductions in our operating plan and our dividend, we have taken significant actions to reset the company in response to much lower commodity prices and tightening credit markets across the industry. These are two factors that have changed significantly in our view in a short period of time, and they have important implications for the sector, especially in 2016 and 2017.","Regarding prices, there are three factors that are driving our actions. First, current prices are much lower than we expected at the time we announced our 2016 operating plan. This is amid bearish supply\/demand signals and record levels of inventories. Brent is currently trading 40% lower than 2015 average prices. Second, we believe this downturn could last a while longer. Just a few months ago, we thought the market would rebalance by the second half of 2016. Now it looks like that can stretch into 2017. And third, greater concerns about global growth suggest it could take longer to reach an equilibrium mid-cycle price after balancing occurs.","Now certainly, there's a lot of debate about these factors, but we can't bet on prices turning quickly. Instead, we're taking what we believe are prudent actions to prepare for a weaker price environment and for a longer period of time.","Regarding the credit markets, it's no secret that the credit rating agencies also see a likelihood of a weaker, more protracted downturn. Recently, Moody's and S&P have issued significantly lower price decks. The agencies have the industry under review for credit rating downgrades. Moody's has stated that multi-notch rating downgrades are likely and some have already occurred. The consequences of these downgrades are that debt capacity will shrink across the sector.","For ConocoPhillips, the bottom line is this. We're going to take actions to maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe this is critical and will be a key differentiator in this business. So as difficult as these choices are, and they were very difficult, we must do the right thing for the company.","As we announced, we're taking two key actions to respond to these factors. First, we are further reducing our 2016 operating plan capital and operating expense.","Now for the past 18 months, we've lowered CapEx and OpEx levels across the company as prices have weakened, and we're doing it again in 2016, and that's shown on slide five. This slide summarizes our revised 2016 operating plan. It represents a significant shift compared to last year and an even bigger shift compared to 2014. Now importantly, these reductions we're making will improve net cash flow in 2016 by $2 billion compared to the plan we laid out in December.","On the left side of this chart, you can see we're lowering our 2016 capital expenditures to $6.4 billion. That's a reduction of $3.7 billion compared with 2015 and $1.3 billion compared to our original 2016 operating plan. We're dropping down to three rigs in the Lower 48 because it doesn't make economic sense to maintain our original level of activity at current prices. And we don't lose acreage or optionality. We're cutting other discretionary programs across the business, which are somewhat offset by anticipated cash calls in our equity affiliates.","Our original plan anticipated 1% to 3% production growth in 2016. Now we expect flat production given these capital cuts. We're letting Lower 48 volumes decline, but these will be offset in the near term from ramp-up at APLNG and in the oil sands.","Finally, we continued to improve our operating costs. We set an initial budget of $7.7 billion for 2016. We're now lowering that to $7 billion. But we don't believe these reductions are sufficient to maintain our strong balance sheet under the lower-for-longer circumstances I just described. And so we've taken a second and more difficult step of reducing the dividend. This morning we announced that we're reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, effective with the first quarter 2016 dividend payment, and this is discussed on slide six.","In mid-December, we reaffirmed that our dividend is the top priority use of cash. In 2016, this was premised on using up to a couple billion dollars of balance sheet capacity based on similar prices to 2015. After making those adjustments to our operating plan that I just reviewed, we analyzed the impact to our balance sheet under conditions where prices stay in the $30s for longer. We came to the conclusion that our balance sheet could get stretched beyond a prudent level.","Ultimately, we believe we needed to make a tough choice between protecting the current level of the dividend or maintaining our strong balance sheet through an extended downturn. We made a decision to reduce the dividend. This action combined with the operating plan reductions will improve net cash flow by about $4.4 billion in 2016.","Once we made that decision, our primary consideration was to set a dividend that will be sustainable through the cycles. We are balancing several objectives, including yield, financial strength, and lowering the breakeven cost of our business. We set the dividend at a level that we believe results in a competitive yield. The dividend will continue to be a top priority. It provides important discipline on our investment programs and will remain a core part of our offering. We believe our dividend is at a level that preserves balance sheet strength and provides financial flexibility through the current downturn.","These actions also lower our breakeven price to roughly $45 per barrel Brent. And what we mean here is that we can keep production flat and pay our dividend for many years at $45 per barrel without needing to sell assets or increase our debt levels. This significant improvement in our breakeven price will allow us to generate greater profitability and cash flow growth when the cycle turns. And the combined reset of capital, operating costs, and the dividend will enable us to generate free cash flow that we can deploy across a range of choices, including increased investment into our low-cost of supply resource base, but also including returning capital to shareholders. The reset will allow us to grow our dividend in the future as our cash flows grow and at a much lower mid-cycle price.","Now it goes without saying that these were very difficult actions to take, but they will improve our ability to manage through the price weakness the industry is facing. They will improve our medium-term outlook by allowing us to accelerate performance as prices turn, and they will help the long-term performance of the business by making us more resilient in a world of lower, more volatile prices.","So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Matt, and I'll come back at the end to conclude my remarks.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ryan. I'll begin my remarks on slide eight. And as Ryan said, I'll open with some brief comments about 2015, a summary of which are shown on this page.","Measured against the standard of delivering the things within our control, it was a strong year. Strategically, we lowered our capital expenditures by more than 40% compared to 2014. We achieved $2.2 billion in disposition proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, primarily North American gas assets, and announced our intention to begin a phased exit of deepwater exploration.","Operationally, we achieved 5% year-over-year production growth excluding Libyan downtime and dispositions. That exceeded our initial guidance for the year and came mostly from the development drilling programs and the ramp-up of production from our major projects. We also achieved first production from Surmont 2 and first LNG from APLNG, which were big milestones for the company.","Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $1.7 billion, or $1.40 per share. This includes a fourth quarter adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $0.90 a share. We recognize that analyst consensus was negative $0.64 per share, and we believe this difference primarily reflects the $506 million of dry hole expense in the quarter in our adjusted earnings, which we think is about $0.15 higher than consensus estimates. The FX impacts accounts for the balance of this difference. Finally, we had $7.6 billion in cash flow from operations excluding working capital and ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","I'll now walk through our cash flow waterfall on slide nine. On this chart, you can see the major buckets of cash sources and uses for the year. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash and generated $7.6 billion from operating activities excluding working capital. Working capital was about a $1 billion use of cash during the year. We captured about $2.2 billion of net proceeds from dispositions and took on about $2.4 billion of debt. Our 2015 capital expenditures were $10.1 billion. And after accounting for dividends and some other items, we ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash.","Turning to slide 10, I'll cover some thoughts on the balance sheet. A period of low prices highlights the importance of a strong balance sheet in a cyclical business. However, a consequence of the recent price drops has been that the credit rating agencies have become very pessimistic about future prices, and they are currently reviewing the industry's credit ratings using much lower forecasted prices. We should see industry-wide credit downgrades over the next couple months, with the potential for multi-notch downgrades in some cases. Across the industry, this is going to result in reduced debt capacity within given rating bands compared to just a few months ago. We believe the reduction in the dividend and the substantially lower risk of significant borrowings as a result of that decision will help mitigate the credit rating impacts.","We are well positioned should we need to acquire additional debt capital. We ended 2015 with over $8 billion in liquidity, comprised of $2.4 billion in cash and about $6 billion of available debt capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We expect to see significant levels of borrowings among our peer companies this year. And our liquidity balance will give us the flexibility to access the capital markets at the time of our choosing and avoid a very crowded energy market for energy sector debt this year. In terms of how much debt we will need to raise in 2016, our current estimate is that we will utilize our cash balances and not need significant additional debt if oil prices average around $40 for the year.","By making the difficult decision to reduce our dividend, we believe we are positioned to preserve a strong balance sheet in a prolonged period of low prices such as the ones we're seeing today. While we have been successful over the last several years in selling assets at full value, during a period of higher prices and strong demands for assets, another important benefit of making the changes we announced this morning and maintaining balance sheet capacity is that asset sales are not necessary to bridge funding gaps.","That concludes my comments. Note that our appendix includes some updated net income sensitivities and some additional 2016 guidance items. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Thanks, Jeff. I'll review our operational performance, beginning with our 2015 reserves. Final reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February, but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly.","On slide 12, you'll see that we started the year with 8.9 billion barrels of reserves. We produced 610 million barrels and had additions of 523 million barrels excluding market factors. So on that basis, our adjusted replacement ratio was 86%. However, because our portfolio is dominated by tax and royalty regimes, there was significant price related reserve impacts in 2015. The lower price effect reduced our year-end reserves by 353 million BOE.","In addition, also due to lower prices, we've reduced our expected capital program for the next several years. This lower pace of development has resulted in a booked reserve reduction of 111 million BOE. Now these combined 464 million barrels have not gone away because prices have dropped. So we expect to reboot reserves as prices improve.","Adjusting our additions for the price effect and the planned capital reductions, we had organic reserve additions of 59 million barrels, which results in an organic reserve replacement ratio of 10% of 2015 production. Reserves were further reduced by 175 million BOE, primarily as a result of non-core asset dispositions. So our total reserve replacement ratio, including both dispositions and market factors, was negative 19%. As I said, more details will be available in our 10-K filing.","Now I'll cover our operational priorities for the year on the next slide. The midpoint of our 2016 production range is expected to be essentially flat to 2015 production when you adjust out the full-year effects of asset sales. In the first quarter, production is expected to be between 1.540 million and 1.580 million BOE per day. Production will be lower in the second and third quarters as we see our usual downtime from major turnarounds. And then in the fourth quarter as we move out of turnaround season, we'll see increased production associated with major project ramps at places like Surmont 2 and APLNG and the production associated with development activity across the globe.","In Alaska, we're still progressing our GMT 1 project and a winter exploration program around existing infrastructure. In the Lower 48, we'll be focused on assessing the results of multiple pilot tests we conducted in 2015. This will allow us to optimize development plans as we prepare for a future ramp-up as our price outlook improves. We also expect to complete our Gulf of Mexico exploration programs before year end.","In Canada, ramp-up continues at Surmont 2, and we have two exploration wells being drilled offshore Nova Scotia.","In our Europe and North Africa segment, we'll continue development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk area, and we expect first production from Alder in the second half of the year. At APLNG, we're now shipping LNG from Train 1. We have shipped four cargos already, and the plant is running well. We also expect the startup of Train 2 in the second half of the year.","Finally, in other international, the second well on our offshore Senegal SNE discovery had very encouraging test rates. We've just finished drilling the third well and are currently preparing to test.","It looks like 2016 may be an even more challenging year for the industry than we have experienced in 2015. But we remain focused on what we can control, delivering best-in-class operational and safety performance. And we are ready to ramp up the development of our diverse, flexible, low-cost of supply resource base when prices recover.","Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan to wrap up.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Matt.","Certainly the journey through this price downturn has been a test for everyone in this industry. The easy moves were made a long time ago. Today, we announced one of the toughest decisions, but we believe it's the right decision given the circumstances facing the industry at this time. We can't count on a quick fix for prices, and we're not willing to risk a strong balance sheet on it. These actions will result in an immediate benefit to our cash position, create the necessary flexibility to endure a longer downturn, and put the company in a better position for a strong performance as prices recover.","So thank you, and we'll turn it back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe if I could just start with \u2013 can you talk a little bit more about \u2013 I know you highlighted some of it in the presentation. But what changed in the last eight weeks? What were the primary changes that convinced you, one, that we were going to be lower for longer? And does this involve a material change in your view on the mid-cycle price as well? I guess what were the primary changes behind first priority in cash CapEx to cut?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Ryan, it was a difficult decision. What drove that is what we talked about in our prepared remarks a bit. The world has changed, and there has been a dramatic drop in the prices. So we're seeing and enduring a much lower drop in prices. And as we look at the fundamentals, it looks like balancing probably is shifting to later in 2016 and possibly moving into 2017. So really it was the depth of the drop over the last eight weeks to two months combined with the duration, and the inventory doesn't seem to be flattening, let alone starting to drop off. And that combined with the last month of conversations that we have been having with the rating agencies, and clearly the debt capacity is going to be reduced.","So when we came out with our operating plan in December, we talked about using the balance sheet to get through the cycle. And now that capacity is reduced, the cycle has deepened and potentially gotten longer, so we have to prepare for that. And we made the difficult decision of preserving the balance sheet over the dividend at that time.","You asked about mid-cycle price. That's a tough one. It looks like it's going to be longer to get there, and there are some downsides and some upsides to that conversation. The downside, the supply has certainly been more resilient than most people expected, and we're still building inventory. Certainly, OPEC for now is protecting price \u2013 or not protecting price in doing that, so they're protecting market share. I think we've seen the resiliency in the unconventional revolution. It's opened up a new supply source that is more flexible, lower cost of supply than some of the other conventional production like deepwater, and certainly some concerns about economic growth.","So those are the things for the downside that would suggest a lower mid-cycle price, but there are other factors. Certainly the capital cuts that the industry is making should result in a supply rebound or a supply shock to the downside. And certainly the Saudis could lead OPEC to a different decision whenever they feel like the point they're trying to make has been made and certainly the lower prices are stimulating demand. So there are pieces on both sides of this thing that balance out the concern about where mid-cycles might be going to. In the past, we've had a view of mid-cycle prices in the mid-$70s, but we're currently taking a look at that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then maybe I guess as we look beyond 2016, how should we think about your effort to balance cash inputs and outputs? Will you seek to ramp spend in line with cash flow by covering cash flow and dividend in line with changes in cash flow? And is the first call on any sensitivity around that, is that a plus or minus on the Lower 48?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll manage the free cash flow. We'll set a CapEx budget and the dividend level to manage to make sure that we can manage as prices come back. Any free cash flow that we have at that point in time we can send back, as I said, we can send back to shareholders or we can put that back into our deep inventory of low cost of supply capital investment options. So that's, granted, a very difficult decision that we made, but part of that is setting a lower breakeven cost for the company. And we're convinced in a world of lower \u2013 we can debate what the mid-cycle price is going to be. It's going to be more volatile, and we're going to create flexibility to have free cash flow as the prices recover and be able to react to the volatility we think the market is going to have.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, I appreciate it.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Hi, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Hello, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","So my question is on the business model and the value proposition. And specifically, for most of the past couple decades, this company offered lower growth to some degree, but healthy shareholder distributions through share repurchases and a reliable and growing dividend. However, because shareholders are not really offered any of those attributes today, and I realize that we could be near the trough of the cycle and this could change, my question is how you would describe your new value proposition and also the business model by which you plan to achieve it in the future, Ryan. So there are two questions there.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thank you, Doug. I appreciate the questions. I think we're spending some time thinking about the value proposition as we go forward. I think fundamentally, at the core of that value proposition, it hasn't changed. We're committed to providing a competitive dividend. We'll have disciplined growth. We've got a deep inventory of growth options if the free cash flow is there to generate it. And we believe in financial strength, which is why we need to keep a very strong balance sheet.","We're hitting the reset button here a little bit, and I can understand that. And it was a gut-wrenching decision for us to go do that. But fundamentally, I don't think that value proposition has changed. We're going to lower the breakeven cost for the company. We'll still provide a competitive dividend and growing as our cash flows grow. And I think fundamentally, the low cost of supply resource base that we have in the company hasn't gone away with this change. It's still there, and it still offers a lot of investment choices for the company.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. And, Ryan, I know it may be too early to ask this question. But my follow-up is, how does the model that you guys are thinking about today differentiate itself in relation to some of these larger-cap E&P companies? And the reason that I ask is because they've produced pretty dismal returns for shareholders during the past couple decades, even with oil prices two or three times higher than they are today. And I know that you don't aspire to that outcome, and it may not be a fair question because it's still early. You just cut the dividend today. But what's the differentiating feature here?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think for us too, I think we have to look at the portfolio. We'll be able to supply growth that we say could be modest, but we'll still grow. We'll have financial flexibility. We'll have a strong balance sheet. We'll generate free cash flow at a much lower mid-cycle price. And we think the world that we're going into is going to be more volatile and probably drive to a lower mid-cycle price as we go forward.","So that's the basic value proposition when we spun the company. We recognize that we may be moving down a bit on the competitive dividend than we've been offering in the past. But we think we're making up for that in some of the free cash flow and the choices then we'll have as we lower the breakeven price for the company, to reinvest that into the company and\/or return that to shareholders.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","I see. Okay, thanks a lot.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Doug.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ryan, I'd like to follow on from Doug's question, if I may, because at 1.6 million \u2013 1.5 million barrels a day, any meaningful growth without committing to another round of large-scale projects is going to be tough in order to be competitive with your peers. So I really want to try and understand. You talked about the compelling dividend, not the competitive dividend in the past as making your value proposition unique. So what makes ConocoPhillips unique today? And I'm thinking specifically about what your first call on cash would be in the event of any kind of recovery. And I've got a follow-up, please.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, Doug, thank you for the question. I think at the risk of repeating myself here a little bit, I think we'll differentiate ourselves because of the low cost of supply deep resource base that we have captured in the company today and the exploitation of it. It's flexible. It's shorter cycle time. It will be much more predictable, and it will generate free cash flow at a much, much lower breakeven price for the company. So we'll have choices. We'll have choices to make as we go forward and the recovery occurs and prices start to come back, which we believe that will happen. Then we'll have choice around how we do that, what kind of growth we think we want to generate because we know we have the portfolio to go do that.","Now we're not talking about high single and double-digit growth rates. That's not what we're talking about with our company. But we have a more predictable, low cost of supply, flexible resource base that we can invest in. And when we generate free cash flow, we can decide what to go do with it. And we're committed to do the dividend. It's still a priority, first use of our cash, and growing that as our cash flows grow.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On a per share basis or on an absolute basis?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Both.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My follow up is on the capital program. So this year, frankly, I'm a little surprised you didn't cut more given the challenging economics across the portfolio. So I'm trying to understand what the constraints are as to why you didn't cut more. And I'm thinking about long-life assets and how those roll off as you go into 2017. I know it's very early to talk about 2017 capital, but you've got what, $600 million on APLNG this year and $800 million on exploration. So what are the constraints on capital? Where do you think that goes next? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Hey, Doug. This is Matt. I think I'll take that question. Of the $6.4 billion, we have about $1 billion going to maintenance capital, and we're never going to cut back on the integrity of our assets. In major projects, it's about $2 billion, and these are major projects that are well into the execution phase. As you said, there's about $700 million or $800 million going into APLNG, for example, to finish Train 2. There's about $300 million going into Clair Ridge to move that towards completion, and about the same going into Malikai in Malaysia. So these are projects that are getting very close to completion.","We've got a development capital program of just over $2 billion, $2.2 billion. And despite the cuts that we're doing in the Lower 48, there's still $800 million of that going into North America as we ramp down our rig program. And then we have, as you mentioned, an exploration program going on that has quite a significant deepwater component next year as we finish our deepwater program. That's a total of $1.2 billion.","So we're going to be looking to execute all of that at lower costs, execute all that scope at lower cost. But our current expectation is that will be $6.4 billion, and that cutting any further would not be prudent, would not be in the best long-term interest of value creation for the shareholders. So that's why we stopped cutting capital at the $6.4 billion level.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, I don't want to hold the call here, Matt, but I want to be clear. How much of that rolls off when these major capital projects are finished is what I'm really trying to get at. In other words, this year there seemed to be some constraints. As you say, you've got to finish what you started. What happens beyond 2016?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","As we move into 2017, we see a couple of things changing. First of all, our deepwater exploration program will be complete. That represents about $800 million this year, and we should be down to virtually zero by the time we get to 2017. APLNG Train 2 will be complete. And in addition to completing APLNG Train 2, we actually in this lower price environment are also having to make contributions into APLNG and FCCL. So if you look at the total of those contributions to the equity affiliates in deepwater, that represents about $2 billion of the $6.4 billion this year. And so that's an indication of how much will be rolling off as we move into 2017.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks very much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys. Could I ask a question on moving to three rigs in the U.S.? I think you were at what, 13 rigs, moving to three rigs. The trajectory in the U.S. I guess would likely be down, but much of that being offset obviously by the major project starts. What does your ability to keep production flat in 2017 look like? Where do those new sources of contribution to maintain that, say, in 2017 and 2018 and beyond?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","So as we move from 2016 to 2017, our base decline is about 8%, so that's about 120,000 barrels a day. So we have to deliver 120,000 barrels a day of new production to stay flat. And that's going to be split roughly evenly between our development drilling programs around the world, so places like Alaska, Europe, China, and some in the Lower 48. We will still be running some rigs and some in Canada. And the other half is going to come from major projects, completing the ramp-up of APLNG, bringing the KBB project onto production, finishing ramping up Surmont 2 and the FCCL projects. So it comes from a mixture of about half and half from development programs around the world and major projects.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then specifically, that rig count that you all referred to, do you see that materially changing as you roll into 2017 and 2018 at this point in time in order to maintain production flat?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","We would anticipate putting more rigs back to work in the Lower 48 as we move into 2017, but that's a function of the capital level that we decide to spend.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And as my follow up, when you look at obviously the big cuts you made to both CapEx and the dividend, can you discuss a little bit on how you came to the math on we needed to see a two-thirds cut here and we need to get down to $6.4 billion? Was it predicated on a certain price outlook, or how did that discussion occur?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, I'll take that. I think it's really trying to triangulate on three different issues that we have in front of us, and that is, one, we wanted to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and minimize the borrowing in 2016, which would lead you in one direction. We certainly had what long-term breakeven price do we think is appropriate and provides for a good value proposition going forward, so that factored into it; and then certainly a desire to keep a competitive dividend as measured by yield or other kinds of factors. So it was really a triangulation around of all those things.","And then factoring into that is our capital program and the commitments that Matt talked about and the capital spend that we need to have that we think makes sense for the long-term value of the company. So there were those pieces that put us in that box trying to decide and triangulate a bit on what the right level of dividend going forward should be for the company.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just wanted to follow up on the choices that you mentioned earlier. What's your target leverage through the cycle? I'm just trying to quantify the choice to deleverage exiting the cycle, which I presume would be a higher priority.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I'll take that one, Evan. I think whether it's target leverage or target credit rating, and particularly on the credit rating side, it's hard to answer any thought about a target at the credit rating agencies because the rating agencies are going a lot through quite a change in how they assess the industry and we don't know what \u2013 really right now what debt levels are going to correlate to what credit ratings. But I think the direction of your question's right. It's just how do we think about the level of our debt going forward.","Just some general comments about debt, if you think about what we've done over the last several years, we ended 2015 with $24.9 billion, so essentially $25 billion worth of debt. And three years ago in 2012, we had $22 billion worth of debt. So unlike some of the peers in our company, we've not really added a significant amount of debt in the last several years. And really what we've been doing as we've been an independent E&P is we've funded our capital program and our dividends mostly from cash from operations and selling non-core assets. And then we quickly made adjustments to our capital program and our operating cost structure as the circumstances have changed to try to limit our debt borrowings, so that's history.","But going forward, how do we think about the question of the right level of debt and what makes sense at different mid-cycle prices? So last year we generated $7.5 billion of cash flow in what was a $50-ish price environment. In 2014, the year before that, we generated $16 billion of cash flow in what was a $90 price environment. And you could think the mid-cycle price is going to be somewhere in that range, between $50 and $90. But we can look at $25 billion of debt, though, and feel like that's a reasonable amount of debt to have in either of those mid-cycle scenarios. So consequently, as prices improve, we don't feel like we're going to be compelled to use cash flows to reduce debt levels. So delevering is not going to be a priority for us.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","But we're not comfortable, and this is what you've heard from us today. We're not comfortable with having a plan that relies on the heavy use of debt financing to fund cash shortfalls in a period of really low prices. And that's where we felt like we were going to be if we continued the current dividend, that we'd be rapidly using balance sheet capacity while we were waiting on some kind of commodity price improvement.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. My second question, you mentioned no asset sales are needed to bridge the funding gap under your commodity assumptions. Is that a conservative view, or does that reflect your view that fair prices may or do not exist in the current environment? Any update there on your current process and what that statement means, anything about that current process?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we've said in the past, a portfolio our size to expect $1 billion or $2 billion of asset sales. We just don't think relying on a significant number of asset sales to bridge a cash flow gap in this environment is a smart thing to go do. And there's going to be a lot of assets on the market. It's a very weak market. And selling into that in a significant \u2013 and trying to raise a significant amount of money, we just didn't think, one, could you even do it; and two, is it the prudent thing to do?","But we do have some assets on the market. They're ones around the fringes of our non-core. They're typically in areas that aren't \u2013 they're either gas or North American gas that haven't been subjected to the recent price downturn on the oil side. And so you ought to still expect a little bit of disposition this year, probably less than what we had last year. But we're still marketing our deepwater assets. We have some assets in Indonesia and in Alaska, and we're still moving those forward. But I think the point Jeff was trying to make is, if you're counting on generating multibillion dollars of proceeds from an asset sale to bridge some cash flow gap at these lower commodity prices, we just don't think that's smart to rely on.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So it looks like the reduction in capital spending, the $7.7 billion to $6.4 billion, correct me if I'm wrong, but the bulk of it looks like it's coming from the Lower 48. So I wanted to be clear there and confirm that. And then the reduction in your production guidance, that also looks like it's therefore more likely than not coming from the Lower 48. So I just wanted to confirm that the delta in both the CapEx and the delta in production is primarily coming from the U.S. And then what does the year-over-year decline look like in your guidance for the U.S. specifically as it relates to liquids?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Neil, you're right. The majority of the capital reduction is in the U.S. associated with cutting the rig count, and that does result in a reduction in production in the Lower 48. We'd expect year over year our Lower 48 production would be about 10% lower as a result of the cuts.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the delta was primarily liquids, I would imagine, because you had already assumed that there would be a decline on the gas side.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then to follow up, I wanted to explore Ryan's initial question on what specifically changed in the oil outlook. Aside from the price on the screen, I know you guys have a really detailed and thoughtful economic analysis process as you think about the commodity. Was it a function of demand? Was it a function of non-OPEC supply? Was it a function of OPEC? Was it a function of inventories, or a combination of all those things?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was a bit of a combination of all those things, but we weren't anticipating a drop from $50 down to $30 like we've seen in the last seven to eight months. We would have probably expected to see inventories at this point in time starting to flatten out at least and not continue to build. So that causes us some concern as we go into the latter half of 2016 and some concern that this might \u2013 lower prices would extend through 2016 and the rebalancing may not occur until we get into 2017.","And then on the demand side, like everybody, we're following China and the growing markets around the world and trying to see what the economic impact is going to be. The fourth quarter GDP in the U.S. was quite low, largely driven by lack of investment in the oil and gas industry driving some of that. But we have some concerns about the demand side starting to loosen a bit as well.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you, Ryan.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Neil.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for taking my question. I had a point of clarification on the decline rate that you guys mentioned earlier. But, Matt, you had mentioned 8%, I believe. Was that for the total portfolio? And I'm just asking because that seems high relative to the prior guidance that I thought was below 5%. So I just want to make sure that that's apples-to-apples and understand if there's any meaningful acceleration and how you see the base holding up at lower spending levels.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Okay, Guy, that's an 8% base decline assuming no capital investment, no new wells to bring on any new production, so it's an unmitigated base decline. And it's consistent with what we've been saying for several years is the underlying decline in our base production. I don't think we've ever said 5%. And the range of 8% has been what we've consistently said. We haven't seen any acceleration in that.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that that would be unmitigated decline.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Yes.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","And then my second one was, you all mentioned a few times maintaining the flexibility to respond with higher activity levels if oil prices improve. Can you talk about how despite cutting the rig count from 13 down to three you have worked or have made plans in place to really preserve that capability and those efficiencies and the ability to quickly respond to the appropriate oil price signals? And with the lower dividend, has that price at which you would ramp up the capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional, has that changed at all relative to the prior view?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","So we are maintaining the capacity to ramp up quickly, both in terms of preparing all the permits that we need to do that and retaining the talent that we need to do that. That's an important part of how we're managing through this downturn is we're retaining that capacity.","In terms of the price that it would take for us to want to put rigs back to work again, it's really not a function of any specific price. It's more a view of our price outlook as to when it would make sense. But having said that, within our Eagle Ford and Bakken portfolio, there are definitely attractive investment opportunities that have a strong rate of return at $45 a barrel or more. So although we haven't set a specific price in mind, we do have a lot of flexibility as prices recover and a lot of good places to put the capital and the talent available to make sure we do that wisely.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. Thanks for the color, Matt.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning. Ryan, I know you've tackled the dividend pretty extensively, but I guess my angle was a little bit different on it. I'm not surprised at the need to go ahead and cut and preserve the balance sheet. I guess what I'm a little surprised about is why even maintain it at all with the $45 breakeven and the current price is around $30. I guess I'm just a little bit concerned we're not setting up for another potential cut down the road if current prices persist. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should think about the ongoing evaluation of the dividend's sustainability if $30 were to maintain for the next, let's say, six to 12 months?","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I'll jump in a little bit on that one. Part of the thought process here is that we recognize that prices could stay in the $30s for an extended period of time. And what we've done as we've set the dividend and set the capital program and looked at our balance sheet capacity is we've set things to a point where we are comfortable that we're going to have the balance sheet capacity to maintain the capital program and maintain the dividend even at prices that persist at today's level for a prolonged period of time.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So you asked why not earlier, Blake, and we've been following this for a long time. We had a view even as much as a year ago that we'd see more lower \u2013 volatile prices. We've been moving the portfolio of the company into more flexibility, shorter cycle time, lower cost of supply. So it's been a view that we've been concerned about really back to the spin. But we've also seen that we didn't anticipate that it would go this low and the potential to be here for this long.","So we were surprised probably by the resiliency of the North American \u2013 the efficiencies, the economies that we've been able to drive as an industry that has kept supply going. We're surprised that OPEC has held on for as long as they have to keep their decision going. So it's been a confluence of factors. We felt like the dividend was certainly manageable at a $75 mid-cycle price. We have concerns about now how long it's going to get there, and that combined with the reduction in capacity on the balance sheet. We still have capacity on the balance sheet. We'll use that if we need to through this lower price cycle. We just wanted to protect that and make sure we had a plan in place for a lower-for-longer outlook. It's prudent to plan for the downside case. We're going to do what's right for the company both in the short, medium, and long term.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it, okay. The next question, I just want to clarify. I think you already went through the capital flexibility moving into 2017, which if I've got correct was $2 billion plus $800 million on deepwater. So that pushes you toward about $3.5 billion. I'm just curious. How does that...","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Blake, that was $2 billion including deepwater.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","$2 billion including deepwater, okay. The question is how does that compare to slide six where you give a capital for flat production in the $45 world. I'm just trying to understand basically what that number is.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","So what we'd expect in a $45 world is to maintain flat production over many years would take about $5.5 billion of capital, so that's what's shown on slide six.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","$5.5 billion. Got it, okay. Thank you, Matt.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Hi, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Before I ask my question, I just wanted to make a comment. Even though your thoughts may not be shared by many and probably may not be totally right, but I actually want to compliment management and the firm for making the right choices when the market conditions changed, and I actually think that it will improve your long-term competitive position. Anyway, Jeff, I think that you talked about that you still have financial flexibility; you surely do. So I guess to maybe eliminate a lot of concern in the marketplace, can you tell us what is your debt capacity you can raise under a BBB rating from the current level? That's the first question.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I don't know that we feel like we can answer that question until we get through our process with the rating agencies. Both of them have significantly reduced their price decks and talked about needing to change perhaps how they view the industry. And I don't know where we're going to settle out in the credit rating bands. The point, like I made earlier, we are not uncomfortable with the debt levels we have. We don't the feel like it's a debt level that is going to require us to do any delevering in the future. And we do feel like we're going to have balance sheet capacity in whatever credit rating range we end up with to handle a prolonged period of lower prices like what we're seeing right now.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you have a minimum that what you think that you may have that debt capacity? We may not know exactly, but is there a minimum level you think that at BBB you can raise by the debt by XYZ amount?","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I don't know that we can really give you that kind of number currently. We do have $8 billion of liquidity. So regardless of what our rating is, we can access that capacity. I think you're asking a different question. But if you're just thinking about how you're going to get through any kind of near-term move, we are not in a position where we have to be concerned with our access to credit markets. We're going to end up in this with a strong investment-grade credit rating, with the balance sheet capacity to be able to continue to fund the capital program and fund the dividend we're talking about now with a continuation of the current price environment. That's where we are. That's a statement we are confident about making.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And the second question is for Ryan. It's a little bit of a curve ball. You decided to exit the deepwater program. But with the cut in the dividend, should we be looking at that decision, whether that with your improved financial and operational flexibility, you should be able to maintain your deepwater program for the long haul?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, Paul. We made a decision, and the decision to exit the deepwater was based on a look at our portfolio, a look at the cost of supply, and how competitive that growth engine would be relative to what we were seeing with our unconventional portfolio and the rest of the total (53:48) portfolio that we have. So we think regardless of what sort of mid-cycle price you return to that we've got more opportunity existing in our captured portfolio and that the deepwater as a growth engine won't compete against that in the portfolio.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just to take a look, I guess, maybe at some of the incoming cash flows, thinking APLNG, the Canadian Oil Sands as well, as you think about current prices versus at $45, can you give us an idea of the impact of those cash flows now to the end of this year to maybe end of 2017?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","So at the current prices we're making capital contributions. We expect to make capital contributions to both. And at $45 a barrel, we would make capital contributions to neither. In fact, we'd be taking proceeds out of the joint ventures at those prices.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then as a follow up, it's not a cash flow, it's a net income driven adjustment for the change in oil prices to the change in net income, just a quick back of the envelope look at it, and I'm talking about the slide here towards the end. It looks like about a $5 difference in oil is how you cover the dividend if I assume net income is a good proxy for cash flow. So at roughly $40, you're having to lean on the balance sheet for the dividend, and at $45 is the way we should think about the company being balanced along with that $5.5 billion CapEx number.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think maybe let me just repeat a couple things that we said today as some calibration points for you on that. So if you just look at 2016, where we said we'll be balanced in terms of not needing to have additional debt with a price that's in the low $40s, but that assumes that we reduce our cash balances. So that's one point. And the other point we're making is as we look longer term at the company in more of a steady state, with the changes we're making in a $45 Brent environment, we're going to be able to have enough capital to keep flat production around the $5.5 billion that Matt referenced earlier and cover our dividend and not have any borrowings, not have any use of cash, not have any asset sales come into that.","So you can just that \u2013 and then every dollar that the price moves above that gives us additional flexibility, as Ryan's mentioned, to either think about increasing shareholder distributions or think about increasing capital to create growth.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and just the last question. Certainly, you're positioning yourself for a much more, let's say, challenging market, if it hadn't been challenging enough already. Bid\/ask spread on assets, you're saying it's a bad time to be a seller. Is it at least worth now considering to be a buyer and with the dividend let's say reduced to a more reasonable size for this oil price environment not being really a headwind and slowing you down and then thoughts of capital allocation?","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That answer, Roger, really hasn't changed for the company. We watch the market. We know what we like, what we don't like. And really the bottom line, like we've said for quite some time, is that for anything like that, it has to be competitive and substitutive in the portfolio today. And we've got a lot of low cost of supply opportunities to invest in our own portfolio that are already captured. So we watch it. We watch it closely to make sure that there isn't anything out there that we want to slip by. But it's a pretty high competitive hurdle in the captured portfolio that we have today. So it's not been a big part, is not a big part of our capital plans right now.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Roger.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. You've outlined that the dividend was a differentiating factor for you guys, which is why we liked it so much. It instilled a level of capital discipline. I understand that prices are now too low for that to be sustained over the long term, but I'm just wondering. Why didn't you tough it out for another year? Why didn't you just have a look for one more year? Because my concern now is that the stuff that you're talking about in debt markets, for instance, surely is going to affect many other companies much worse than you guys. And I'm just worried that you've capitulated at the bottom, if you want. Was that a consideration? Couldn't we have seen you just go one more year? Thanks.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul. As I said, it was a very, very difficult decision. We looked at all those kinds of aspects. How long should we \u2013 how long do we ride it, when do we think the market is going to turn? And I think it's informed by a view that we had to plan for a downside case of if this lower price is persistent, we're going to have a longer downturn, and that combined with reduced capacity on the balance sheet. We've been prepared to use the balance sheet and are still prepared to use the balance sheet, but we didn't think it was appropriate to take it up to the edge and destroy it or put it in a place where we no longer had a strong balance sheet in case the worst case happened and this was prolonged for a longer period of time. So it's informed by where we think the market is today and the changes that we've seen with respect to the capacity we have on the balance sheet to remain investment-grade.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think I'll add to what Ryan has said. As you get to a really low price environment like what we're seeing today, I think there's a question of what your balance sheet capacity is, and there's just a question of how quickly you use up balance sheet capacity. And if you stay in the $30 price environment, I think what you're going to see across the industry is people are either going to have to be dramatically reducing their capital or they're going to be borrowing extreme amounts of debt relative to their current debt levels. And we don't think that that was an appropriate way for us to run the company.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Or they're going to have to sell a bunch of assets to make a bunch of money in a very down market, or they're going to have to permanently destroy shareholder value and float equity.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, but that's my point. I mean these are other companies that are weaker than you. I just think that you possibly could have applied pressure, if you liked, across the less strong companies if you had somewhat kept going with the policy. And I'm just trying to get my arms around the decision. And frankly, you've outlined it pretty clearly why you've done what you've done. I just feel that it might be a bit pro-cyclical to do it right here right now just before debt markets get really bad.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I take your point, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great. Could you just then talk a little bit about staying flat as opposed to any other volume outlook? Again, people have talked a lot about this, but I'm just wondering. Is the idea now that as we go forward you're going to try to grow at a level at which you would grow the dividend, or just anything about the volume, the specific volume being flat? What's magical about being flat? Thanks.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say, Paul, we're not trying to manage right now to a certain production level. We're trying to manage to the capital program that makes sense for the long-term value of the company, maintain our options, maintain the ability to ramp back up production. And production falls out of that. Production is what production is. I've said numerous times. We're not going to drill into this headwind. Deferral makes sense. It makes economic sense. We're just trying to set an appropriate capital level to meet the commitments that we have, manage the short, medium, and long term for the company, and production falls out of that.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","We weren't trying to say that our expectation or our aspiration is to be flat. We were just illustrating the point that at $45 a barrel, we can maintain flat production and cover the capital and the dividend. It was really to illustrate a point rather than to express an aspiration.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And just finally, I've been a big fan of your analyst meetings and your disclosure. Could I just ask you? I think it's too much to ask you right here on the spot, but the slide that you have showing the breakeven of your resources obviously looks a bit scary now because the lowest end of your band of economic resources is $45. Much of it is really set on $75. But if I could ask you to update that over the course of the next few weeks, it would be very helpful to us. Thank you.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll take that on, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Actually just picking up on that last question, I was going to look at that same pie chart myself. And you guys had talked a couple of times in giving answers about what's going to differentiate COP going forward. You guys had talked about the low cost of supply and the resource base as a future differentiating factor. Can you characterize I guess how much of what the opportunity is I guess within that resource base, whether it's PUDs or just resource for margin accretion? There were three legs of the investment case originally, moderate growth, moderate margin accretion, and the dividend. So we're not going to have growth, we're not going to have a dividend, but margin accretion is possible as you replace barrels. So what's the opportunity there, especially as obviously we're seeing a cyclical decline in the cost basis here?","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","We're going through a process just now, James, of updating our cost of supply, and you're right. What we would expect to see is that the cost of supply of a lot of this resource base, all of it in fact is going to be declining as a result of the deflation that we're seeing across the sector. So we'll get that update sometime later in the year. We'll be ready to talk about that. But the amount of resource that's available below $45 a barrel or below $60 or below $75 is growing as we improve our technology and as we see deflation. So we would expect to see that picture improve, and with a lot of diverse opportunities to deploy capital to give us both production growth and margin growth.","Ryan M. Lance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would add to that, James. The basic premise when we launched as an independent company around the growth and margin and production, this reset allows us to grow off a much lower breakeven base and make decisions around that. The investments that we're going to make into that resource base, the basic premise, again, that hasn't changed. That resource base is still there, and it's going to represent higher margins than what the average of the total portfolio is today. So we'll see margin growth. We'll see absolute growth. And yes, we've reset the dividend a bit. But as we've said all along, with a lower breakeven cost, we've got choices about how we allocate free cash flow, and we'll have free cash flow at a much lower breakeven cost.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, guys. Great. Thanks very much. We'll wait for the update.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. One question I have is just a clarification on the sustaining capital requirements. I think two months ago the number was around $6.3 billion, and now it's $5.5 billion. So I was wondering what drove the reduction. And related to that, you're basically keeping production flat this year at around $6.4 billion. So I was just trying to square those two numbers.","Matthew J. Fox - Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production","So what the $5.5 billion represents is essentially an adjustment of the $6 billion for the lower price environment. We said it was going to take $6 billion at $60 a barrel. When we look at our supply chain models, we can execute that same amount of scope and for $5.5 billion if prices are $45 a barrel. So it's a combination of that and the efficiencies that we've seen as we have been executing our programs through 2015.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And my second question is just a question around cash from operations. Deferred taxes have been a big swing factor over time. And I was just wondering, Jeff, how you would suggest we should think about that variable with the strip pricing where it is in 2016. I know there are a number of different moving pieces there, and you gave us some color on the equity earnings line, but I was wondering if you could talk about deferred taxes.","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Phil. The situation in the industry I think is generally in right now is we don't find ourselves in cash tax-paying positions in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate. So in the past, you would have thought of deferred taxes being driven primarily between timing differences on depreciation between book and tax. But now it's really driven by the fact that when you have financial book losses, you're not able to \u2013 you don't get any cash benefit for those tax losses. So I would think the guidance I'd get people to think about deferred taxes is as you do your modeling, if you're coming to a negative number for taxes when you do your income modeling, that's going to be a negative on deferred taxes as well because we're not going to be seeing a cash benefit from that negative tax number","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So is there a rough level of like $35 or $40 that you would think about generally?","Jeffrey W. Sheets - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No, I think it's just going to be progressive as prices improve. As you can see from when you look at results across the industry, you'll see negatives on the cash flow statement, really the deferred taxes, because everybody has been in these tax \u2013 these financial loss positions. As prices improve, those losses will get smaller and deferred tax will swing around first to being less negative than zero and then being a positive again for us in the future as prices rise. But I can't give you just exact cutoffs in prices as far as when that will occur.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - VP-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks, Phil. Christine, let's wrap it up here.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Christine. Hello, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects; and Matt Fox, our EVP of Strategy Exploration and Technology.","Our agenda for today's call is to have Ryan review our key milestones from the third quarter, from the year-to-date, and then some of our focus areas for the remainder of the year.","I want to note that all of our usual financial and operational highlight slides are included in today's deck in backup for your information. They're very straightforward. So after Ryan's remarks, our plan today is to go directly to Q&A. Our cautionary statement is shown on page 2 of today's deck. We will make some forward-looking statements during the call that refer to future estimates or plans.","Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide and in our periodic filings with the SEC. And then, finally, we'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today, and that's to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. Reconciliations to those non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. 2018 has been another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. Slide 4 summarizes our achievements from the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.","Our value proposition is all about returns. We're laser-focused on disciplined free cash flow generation and strong execution. Discipline means we're not chasing higher prices by ramping up activity. By staying disciplined, we generate strong free cash flow, which we then allocate in a shareholder-friendly way. And underpinning our discipline in cash flow allocation is predictable, consistent execution quarter in and quarter out.","Our commitment to these elements has driven strong results across the business in the third quarter and throughout this year. Starting with our strategic milestones on the left. Earlier this month, we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. In July, we increased our 2018 buyback target to $3 billion. That's the pace we're on for the year. At the same time, our board increased the total authorization to $15 billion, representing about 20% of our shares since the buyback program began.","This sent a strong signal to the market that we have confidence in our plans for continued shareholder value creation. The combination of our dividend and buybacks represents a return to shareholders of about 35% of CFO, well in excess of our 20% to 30% target. Importantly and distinctively, these distributions were funded organically.","We're delivering on all our strategic priorities and that means focusing on all aspects of value capture. For example, there's been a lot of interest in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA. We announced in August that we had reached a settlement agreement to fully recover the arbitration award of about $2 billion. This was a major milestone in this effort. This quarter, we recognized $345 million of that settlement. So we are collecting.","Finally, we continue to optimize our portfolio and have announced about $600 million of additional dispositions over the past few months. Our financial performance has improved consistently throughout the year. Stronger prices help, but we're also benefiting on a relative basis due to our Brent weighted mix and from ongoing efforts to mitigate inflation risks and keep a lid on costs.","In the third quarter, we generated $1.6 billion, or $1.36 per share of adjusted earnings. And here's some interesting perspective. The last time ConocoPhillips generated quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion from continuing operations was in the third quarter of 2014. Brent was over $100 per barrel and our production was almost 1.5 million barrels of equivalent oil per day. So we're as profitable today as we were then despite prices being 25% lower and volumes being 20% lower. So bigger isn't always better. That's why we're focused on per share growth and value, not absolute volume growth.","Our portfolio and efficiency efforts have boosted the underlying strength of our company and driven what we believe is peer-leading sustaining price of less than $40 WTI. We've significantly improved our resilience to low prices without capping upside for investors and that's the key to outperformance through the cycles.","Cash from operations in the third quarter was $3.5 billion and CapEx was $1.6 billion. So we generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow, which more than funded our dividend and buybacks.","Year-to-date cash from operations is $9.1 billion. This exceeded CapEx by $4 billion. Of this free cash flow, over $3 billion has been returned to our owners. We also further reduced debt, while keeping our CapEx in check and maintaining strong liquidity.","At the end of the quarter, we had about $4.8 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Our debt reduction target was achieved 18 months ahead of schedule. The credit rating agencies have noticed and they have responded with recent upgrades. We are now single A-rated by all three of the agencies.","Importantly since our value proposition is all about returns, let me give you a current snapshot. Our 12-month trailing return on capital employed is now in double digits and our cash return on capital employed is over 20% and those returns should continue to improve.","Strong financial performance is possible because of consistent, predictable execution on the operating side of the business and the organization again delivered this quarter like they have done all year.","Third quarter production excluding Libya was 1.224 (sic) [1,224] (07:07) million barrels of oil equivalent. That's underlying year-over-year growth of 6% on an absolute basis and 28% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. Our disciplined plan remains very much on track and we expect to close out 2018 on a strong note.","Our key annual turnarounds were completed safely and our operations are running smoothly. We recently started up conventional projects in Alaska and Asia Pacific with two additional startups expected in Europe this quarter. We recently sanctioned GMT-2 in Alaska and spud our first exploration well in the Louisiana, Austin Chalk. So we're building good momentum heading into 2019.","Now in December we'll announce our 2019 operational plan. You can expect our capital to be roughly in line with this year's capital excluding acquisitions. And I think this is a clear indication that we're not straying from our strategies, so no surprises there.","This quarter marks the second year of our anniversary of when we launched our disciplined, return-focused value proposition. At that time, we established a leadership role in executing what we believe is the right strategy for this cyclical business. We're committed to maintaining consistency and discipline through price domains.","This is fundamental. Our sustaining price of less than $40 gives us a distinct advantage at lower prices and we offer investors unhedged exposure to higher prices. Now, as we head into 2019, you can count on us to remain disciplined focused on free cash flow generation and strong execution of the business. That's our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycles. We know it's a formula that works and we're sticking to it.","So let me turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, and thanks for the color Ryan. I guess I'll ask a question on the capital number that you referenced for 2019 since you're willing to give that. It sounds like obviously you're not looking to ramp up spending. You do have, I think, some roll-off spending from some projects that are ramping here in the fourth quarter. But, do you expect any activity increase, say, in Lower 48 in 2019? And if not, is there a scenario where you would consider it because obviously we have a lot higher price now than we did before?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Phil, thanks. As I said, I think we're staying pretty committed to our disciplined plan. Wanted to give a signal to you all about kind of where we see 2019 headed. I'll let Al kind of chime in on some of the \u2013 a bit more detail about that but we expect our capital to be roughly in line with kind of where we're at today all things being equal. But there are some moving parts within the portfolio that are important. And I think Al can provide you a little bit of color on that.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. So Phil, we obviously haven't set our exact capital number for 2019 yet. We'll do that in December and announce it to the market then but Ryan's already given you a pretty strong hint at how it's going to turn out. Really consistent with where we've been all year, we don't plan to make any significant changes to our activity level in the Big 3 in the Lower 48. We do have some new projects that will be attracting CapEx in 2019 higher versus 2018. And we also have the acquisitions in Alaska this year. Let me mention a few numbers there.","We've got GMT-2 in Alaska. Barossa that is progressing and we're starting to spend more CapEx. And also the Montney where we've got \u2013 it's really still in the appraisal phase but we are building processing capability and water capability that will be adding to our CapEx next year.","And in addition, we have our increased working interest at Kuparuk assuming that we close there on that deal and in the Western North Slope. And when you add all that up it's about $500 million plus or minus of increased CapEx in 2019 versus 2018 for those things. But we also have some significant roll-off of major projects that are finishing up. So you've got Aasta Hansteen, Clair Ridge, Bohai Phase 3 and the Bayu-Undan in-fill wells. When you add all that up that roll-off, it's also about $500 million.","So those roughly offset each other. And so that's how we get to a plan that is roughly what Ryan was describing where the major project roll-on, roll-off are roughly offsetting and we're staying similar in our Lower 48 activity levels.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then, I guess, the second question Al for you would be some of the topics of the day here just on takeaway. There's been a lot of talk about frac commitments for NGLs as well as Bakken takeaway. Maybe you could just elaborate how Conoco is positioned on these issues?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Phil, this is Don. Maybe I'll take that one. As far as fractionation capacity overall for NGLs in the Lower 48, we're in pretty good shape. We're not seeing any takeaway constraints.","Relative to the Bakken certainly within the basin everybody can see that processing capacity is starting to get pinched there with the growth in the Bakken production about 150,000 barrels a day year-over-year and additional competition from the Canadian imports as well.","So we're not seeing takeaway problems on the gas or the processing or the NGLs side up in the Bakken. And we don't anticipate any \u2013 the midstream companies that we work with have expansion plans that we expect to be in place toward the end of 2019.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, Don, just to be clear on the Bakken I was talking more on the crude side. I was just trying to understand how much do you put on DAPL versus the rail? Any color on those dynamics?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, I'd be happy to Phil. I don't know that I'm going to get into specific pipelines, but generally the way that I think or we think about the Bakken kind of three different market centers there. You've got the Rockies refining center that's sort of the local market. And then we have access through pipe commitments to the Mid-Continent, so kind of the Chicago area Patoka, Clearbrook.","And then the third is Cushing and we go in all three different directions. I would say that lately we have flexibility so it shifts from one quarter to the other how much is going into each location. But in the third quarter, I believe a good estimate would be about 50% is sold within the Rockies. That gives you an indication of our exposure to say currency type pricing; probably 30% to Cushing and maybe 20% to the Mid-Con. And we're not seeing takeaway constraints there.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Good morning, Doug.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","On Venezuela, Ryan you mentioned the $345 million payment from PDVSA in the quarter. And I think that another $500 million is expected by year-end and you guys get the remainder over four and a half years. So my question is, is this the correct profile for those cash payments? Is that the right way to think about it? And second given the uncertainty in Venezuela, is there any recourse that you have if PDVSA doesn't pay on schedule? So how are you guys thinking about those two things?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Doug. Let me just clarify and then Don's been on point for us. He can chime in too as well. But, yeah, we recognized $345 million of revenue in the third quarter from the settlement and that's part of a total of $500 million that we should receive this year. And we should get the remaining part between the $345 million and the $500 million in the next month or so.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Then, we start a monthly or a quarterly amount that we get until the full $2 billion is paid full to ConocoPhillips. And we have provisions if they miss payments to go back after some of the assets and I'll maybe let Don elaborate on that a little bit.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, maybe just to drill down into a few more facts around that Doug. On the \u2013 as Ryan mentioned, our settlement agreement called for $500 million of early payments or we refer to them as initial payments as part of the $2 billion collection from the ICC award. And that $500 million was comprised of two components really. And you'll probably recall that we seized crude inventories as part of our enforcement actions. That was about 4 million barrels of oil that had a notional value of around $300 million, so that was the commodities element of that. And we've been marketing that oil and most of it has been lifted. We still have some to go.","The other component were two cash payments of $100 million each. And the first cash payment was due the first week of October. PDVSA provided that the last week of September, actually. The second payment is due in November. And so that sums up the total $500 million that we anticipate that we'll collect during 2018. And then, as Ryan mentioned then we go into a quarterly payment schedule of around $85 million a quarter for, I believe, it's the next 18 quarters or however long it takes to recover the full $2 billion.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. And then also Ryan you mentioned that your financial performance is the best it's been since I think second or third quarter of 2014 when Brent was above $100. And then going forward obviously if this performance \u2013 if the performance continues to be strong and spending is not rising much, which I think you implied debt reduction programs mostly complete. Then the question becomes, what are the plans for or priorities for surplus funds going forward? Meaning, would you allow cash to build on the balance sheet, increase share repurchases? What are some of the parameters around the thinking in that area?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Thanks, Doug. We've kind of said we're holding our activity level. We like to execute a constant level of activity kind of through the cycle. And so that does kind of say what, as we generate the cash flow that we see the ability to generate what do we do with that. And I'd say, at this point in time, we feel comfortable with the averaging that we're \u2013 the constant level of buybacks that we're executing. We'll watch the market see how that's going. But I think you should expect to see cash probably rise on the balance sheet. And we'll also address that in a bit more detail in December. But right now that's \u2013 that's where we're heading and you'll see our net debt fall a little bit.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks a lot.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I don't know, maybe this is for Al. Al, have you guys shut-in any production in Surmont given the price that it must be pretty close to if not below your cash variable cost there?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. We have had \u2013 we talked about some of the shut-in production or curtailed production that we had back in the third quarter. I talked about on the last call that was really driven by the Syncrude outage. But in the fourth quarter we also do have some small curtailments that are driven by netbacks and trying to just maximize our cash there. But right \u2013 it will be in the round-off in terms of our production volumes in terms of the numbers.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you guys have any \u2013 the intention to sign a new well deal, related to the Surmont production?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Paul, yeah, we have a good bit of Surmont blend going on, on rail right now. I think in the third quarter we've had maybe something like 45% coming to the U.S., maybe 55% sold into the Edmonton trade center. These are kind of rough numbers. And then of the amount going to the U.S., it was pretty evenly split between pipe and rail, maybe a little bit more on rail than pipe.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, Don, do you have any intention to increase that given there's some fear that situation could get far worse before you get better?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","No, yeah, that's exactly right. And even in the fourth quarter, we're going to see \u2013 I mentioned, what, 45% going to the U.S. in the third quarter. That's going to rise above 60% in the fourth quarter. And almost all that increment is on rail. So we are expanding our rail capacity.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And those are long-term minimum volume contract or are these all based on spot?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","No, these are term contracts. I don't know \u2013 they're not as long as the five-year deals that you hear about the rails are insisting. We got in and got these contracts before the terms got that onerous. So the intention is to bridge us over to the next major pipeline expansion, so a few years.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then the benefit you're showing up in your price realization rate already or that you're showing up somewhere else?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Say it again, Paul.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","I didn't understand it Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, the benefit, I mean, given that if you're looking at the cost to value is much less than what the discount rate would imply. So I assume that once you value it down you get the minor price. And so that your price realization comparing to the Edmonton, if you sell it there, it would be much higher. So I guess my question is that in those volume, the benefit that you will see if you're showing up just simply on the price realization is higher than you report or is there someplace else that we should look for?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","No, it will show up in the realizations and that is going to vary from one quarter to the next. Currently pipe is going to give by far the highest realizations at least it does under our arrangements and then followed by rail. Because rail cost into say Cushing or to the Gulf Coast is generally in the \u2013 it's not in the high teens, it's more in the low teens.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A final one for me. Ryan, there's some concern from in the industry that as we free up Permian, we're just going to shift the bottleneck in the middle of the country into the Gulf Coast because the export capability may not be sufficient by early 2020. Where do you stand in that debate? And whether you guys were trying to be more active trying to accelerate the bottleneck on the export capability.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, I'll let Don chime in as well, Paul. But, yeah, we see the same thing as most industry has been looking at is the bottleneck gets eliminated from pipe in the Permian and moves to the Gulf Coast, we'll be exporting a lot more crude. I can let Don comment on how we're thinking about that more specifically.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Paul, we think the Gulf Coast is going to require expansion. There are plans in place in both Corpus Ingleside and Houston to expand the export capability. And we think those plans are proceeding along at a good pace.","Just to give you some numbers on ConocoPhillips, we've sold probably something around 10 million barrels over the docks this year. So, that's going to vary a lot from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter depending on whether the arbs (25:13) open or not. But on average for the year that would be about 35,000 barrels a day or in other terms, it represents about 30% of our Eagle Ford sales. Currently, we're not \u2013 we don't have transportation to the Gulf from Permian, so that's all Eagle Ford.","And those exports have helped our realizations. That's one of the reasons why our realizations are so strong. In the third quarter, our waterborne barrels average WTI plus about $3 netback to the Eagle Ford lease. So, really good performance there.","But just generally from an industry, you're asking about more the industry capability and the wave of Permian production coming into the Gulf. Right now, we think the Corpus Ingleside area has about 800,000 barrels a day of export capacity. And recently in August, they exported about 400,000 barrels a day. So, right now, 50% of their capability.","If you move up to Houston, we estimate about 1.6 million barrels a day of export capacity at the Port of Houston. And August exports were 400,000 barrels a day, so a lot of surplus capacity in Houston.","Now, Corpus has active plans to dredging and adding buoys and things like that that are going to grow export capacity over 2 million barrels a day by 2022, late 2021. So, I think a lot of this is going to depend on obviously the pace of Permian production.","Just looking at the pipeline schedules, the new pipes being built out of the Permian to the Gulf Coast, it looks like those planned toward Corpus are probably going to go in first. And so we'll probably see a little bit of bottleneck at Corpus initially. But then once the pipes go in from the Permian to the Port of Houston, the ship channel come on then that should alleviate the bottleneck.","So, as we look at it and back up, we think, yeah, there's probably going to be some tightness, particularly at Corpus, probably in late 2019 when these pipes start-up. But that probably \u2013 we're probably talking about bottlenecks in months, in terms of months rather than years. So we don't think this is going to be a significant problem.","Now I mentioned our export capacity. I will confirm that we are and have been actively discussing expanding our capability in that regard. We think that's going to be important over the next few years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for getting me on. Can I start with a fairly asinine housekeeping question, if I may? And it's really the \u2013 I just noticed in the nonrecurring charges you're still rolling through some restructuring and impairment charges on the P&L in the third quarter. Are you guys done with your cost-cutting initiatives or is it still going on? If you could frame what \u2013 is that legacy or is it something new?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","We're chuckling to ourselves Doug. Al's got, yeah, go ahead.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, I mean, I can talk about that. Well, no, we're not done and we're never done. We despite the higher volumes that we've \u2013 the increased 25,000 barrels a day that we've had to our guidance since the start of the year, we're still planning to hit our original OpEx target, $5.7 billion. And so, we've done that by shaving about $0.25 a barrel off our unit operating cost.","But as an example of one of the kinds of things we've been doing is we continue to focus on our costs even as oil prices have come back up. We recently had a reorganization in our Houston center in our Lower 48 organization and the increased productivity and organizational effectiveness that we've had there has allowed us to reduce our Houston staffing by about 10% this year, including sort of open jobs that we didn't fill.","And so we have some severance costs that are associated with that. But we expect that that effort alone will allow us to decrease our Lower 48 G&A cost by about $0.30 a barrel next year. So we're continuing to work away on it. Even for us, it's not higher prices are back so we can quit focusing on that. We're continuing to work and so that's what that's associated with.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer. Just to be clear, again always a bit of an asinine part to that. The $5.7 billion, that includes transport, right, transportations and not OpEx?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, it's what we call our kind of controllable costs. It includes transportation. So it's got lifting costs in it including transportation, it also has G&A and other costs.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the Alaska piece like TAPS and so on that's in there as well or not?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","What was that, the TAPS? Yeah. That's in there as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. That's in there as well. Okay, great. Thank you. My follow-up is really hopefully a relatively quick one. It's \u2013 obviously, Ryan you guys have set the bar pretty high as it relates to capital discipline. You've got a lot of stuff still coming online which is obviously helping the momentum on the tailwind on production.","My question is, as the balance of these project spending rolls off as you get through the stuff that Al mentioned, there's also a lot of things out there that you guys appear to have been competing for. For example, Qatar LNG as well as the ramp-up in Barossa that you talked about already.","So I'm just kind of curious what do you think happens to the longer-term capital plan beyond 2020? And if you could maybe give us a refresh on where you see the sustaining capital today given the inflationary environment I'd appreciate that as well. So basically two parts to that; the longer-term CapEx, assuming you've won some of those projects and what's the sustaining capital like in today's environment? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, thanks, Doug. I can \u2013 maybe Matt can chime in on the sustaining capital, he's pretty close to that. Yeah, I'd say, we're pretty disciplined in trying to make sure we generate the free cash flow. But you're right, we have some very good projects that we're competing for and hopefully we'll be successful in North Field expansion in Qatar and we're going to \u2013 we need to backfill our LNG facility in Darwin, Northern Territories. And then ultimately, we will have more exploration discoveries coming in Alaska. So we've got things on the plate. But with that said, we have projects that are rolling off and we continue to look at the portfolio. And we continue to make adjustments in the portfolio to account for what we see coming in as capital and we'll talk some more about that.","We'll describe that in more detail here in the \u2013 coming forward the 2019 plan in December and how we're thinking about that and then ultimately how we're thinking about the long term as well. But we won't lose our discipline. We won't \u2013 we'll keep a steady scope in what we're doing in the Lower 48 unconventionals. We've got some \u2013 we're starting our exploration results in the Austin Chalk. And as Al mentioned earlier, we have a stacking and spacing pilot going on in the Montney. But we're going to manage all that within the portfolio and make sure that we keep our discipline on the capital side. Specific to sustaining capital, I can let Matt chime in there.","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Doug, you might remember, I think you asked me a similar question last year at the Analyst Meeting about what would happen to sustaining capital over time. And I said that we would see increases in sustaining capital but what we were actually focused on was maintaining the lower sustaining price.","So what we'd anticipate moving ahead is the sustaining capital that we talked about last year was $3.5 billion or so. We'd expect that to move through next year and 2020 to $3.8 billion. So that's about the same amount of increase in sustaining capital as the increase in production. But the sustaining price is not increasing. The sustaining price is still well below $40 a barrel. So as we anticipate and we're getting some modest increases in sustaining capital over time as the production is increasing, but we're not seeing any increase in sustaining price at all.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Matt, just to be clear, on the last call you ticked up your CapEx for this year on inflation. Has there been any inflationary impacts on that $3.8 billion?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. No, Doug, I can talk about the inflation effects on 2018 if you like. But that's not a key thing that's driving that. It's really just having a higher level of production. Like Matt said, your production goes up 10%, your sustaining cost is going to go up 10%.","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, so it's reflecting things like the acquisitions in Canada and so on. So it's not really \u2013 it's not inflation-driven.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys.","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","Alaska, sorry. Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thanks. Matt, this first question might follow on a little bit from that. As you look at the inventory on your cost of supply assuming that you've updated this through the summer, is the shale piece still expanding at a lower cost point? You certainly get a sense in the market that some people are saying shale is being pushed up the cost curve, so I'm interested in your observation on that?","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","No, we have been updating our supply curve and maybe later in the year, early next year we'll be finished with that work and we can talk more about it. But what we have seen is an increase in the unconventional resource \u2013 from our existing land possessions and actually still a decrease in the cost of supply associated with that. So we are not seeing either a reduction in the resource or an increase in the cost of supply quite the reverse.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. And is that \u2013 sorry, Matt is that spread across the shale portfolio or is it specifically the Eagle Ford or...","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","It's spread across the shale portfolio as a whole and basically reflecting efficiencies and the changes in completion designs increasing recovery and so on. So it's across the whole portfolio.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","It sounds like. My follow-up just on your scenario analysis. You look at all the factors of sort of global demand and supply. How's the scenario analysis shaping up? It sounds like you still believe in unrelenting shale. Is there anything on the demand side you see?","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","I mean so \u2013 yeah, the scenario that we're in just now would be on the supply side the unrelenting unconventionals. I mean that's still happening. And right now we're in a place of relatively high demand for our scenarios. So we're in a place where we've got supply increasing but demand matching it so we haven't really seen any change. We go through a scenario monitoring process every year and try and reassess the probabilities of those scenarios as we look out in time. And really, we haven't seen any significant change this year on how we see those playing out.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Great. Thanks, Matt. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a follow-up on the PDVSA arbitration. Could you talk about what that means for the other ongoing arbitrations, I'm thinking with Venezuela specifically?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Bob. This is Don. So we have two other arbitrations related to Venezuela. The biggest by far is the ICSID arbitration, which is a claim against the Republic of Venezuela for expropriation. I think, previously, we had indicated that we expected the results of that damage award to be made public in the fourth quarter of this year. And we've been since informed that that's slid, and we're being told now that those results will be announced in the first quarter of next year, 2019. The other is a smaller potential award related to an offshore development, not a heavy oil project, that was called Corocoro, and that's an ICC award or arbitration.","So, I'm sure there's interest in how all these different arbitration actions relate to each other. So, what we've said is that, if ICSID, for example, comes up with a higher award, which is what we would expect, then what ICC came up with this past spring then this \u2013 we wouldn't be looking for dual recovery to the extent that they address the similar issues there would be an offset. So, one would offset the other. And we'll just have to go through the final result from ICSID to determine what additional compensation Venezuela might owe us.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, you're saying that if the ICSID number was higher you'd sort of offset that against the already claimed ICC award?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, to the extent that they addressed the same issues. Now, there's a potential \u2013 there will probably be instances where they're dealing with different components that the ICC didn't address. In that case, it wouldn't be overlapping. But, yeah, there's a potential for a significant amount of overlap between the awards.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's clear. Thank you very much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Getting back to the CapEx question, fair to say that on a mix basis you're going to be still 60% plus sustaining, 20% plus short-cycle, the rest long-cycle?","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","Well, I mean, the sustaining will be in the $3.8 billion range. This year, it's at $6.1 billion. I don't know what that ratio is, but it's roughly two-thirds, a bit less than two-thirds sustaining.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","And we would expect that to stay similar, John.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. With the Montney, when will the gas price we're seeing and water be in place so you're going beyond the testing mode?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So, in the Montney, we talked in the past about the 12-well pad that we're putting in right now that's really a spacing and stacking pilot. We're drilling well number 9 right now of the 12. And in fact, well 8 that has already been drilled, we put in our proprietary fiber-optic diagnostic system. So, we're using this opportunity in appraisal mode to also collect a lot of extra data to help map out the future development of our entire acreage there.","But construction is currently underway on the processing plants, the flow lines, the water handling systems; so all that is in progress. We've also made additional takeaway commitments on both the liquids and gas side there to support the next phase of appraisal and all the production that comes from that. So, you'll see all that starting to come online next year.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Latter half, Al?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Yeah, it will be in the back half of next year.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","(41:59)","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Last one for me is on dispositions. Still little things to come out like the Barnett or can you give us a sense of how much you're going to do a year, ballpark?","Matthew J. Fox - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. We announced the Barnett, the $230 million, and the Sunrise at around $350 million. So those are the ones that we've announced recently. Yeah, we would expect to continue to be taking action on the portfolio over time. And it could be lumpy, but what we sort of indicated in the past is that we could be looking at dispositions in the $1 billion to $2 billion on average over time and we \u2013 that will come in a sort of lumpy nature. But we are still looking at that aspect of the strategy to make sure that the portfolio is as strong as it can be.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess let's keep with the Canada theme here for a bit. So, big LNG project got announced for Kitimat. Would we \u2013 should we anticipate that's ultimately where a lot of the Montney gas development that you're doing would be able to go? Or should we think about it as dependent on another exit route?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Our current work that we're doing on Montney gas export so far is not going to Kitimat. It's going to more traditional routes and coming south, yeah.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And what's your identified pipeline routes for that then or other alternatives maybe locally?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. There are pipelines that come reasonably near past our acreage, some of which are getting full and new ones being built. We're not really in the mode of talking about which pipelines we're talking to right now. But, over time, we'll have to take on quite a bit of pipeline capacity to meet our full plans over a period of time.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a question coming back to kind of the CapEx versus production growth expectations; you walked through earlier kind of the shift of $500 million from one to another in terms of completed projects and new projects. But as we think about the base spending, yet the ability to deliver growth, is the efficiency you're seeing whether that's straight-up productivity gains or just the change in well lateral lengths and so forth, is that going to then be equivalent with the rate of growth we should expect production wise?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, we certainly \u2013 you've seen with another quarter's worth of data that we're continuing to do better than the 22% CAGR that we had laid out in our Analyst Day and we'll be \u2013 we've indicated more like a 35% is what you should expect this year. And that has largely been driven by some of the outperformance that you referenced.","But, of course, that also gives us a higher level of production this year that makes it harder to keep growing it. So I'm not \u2013 with what we have right now, you wouldn't expect you would keep maintaining that same kind of 35% CAGR without yet some new breakthrough that comes along that allows you to continue to have these large improvements that we've seen this year.","And so, we'll see how that plays out over time. But we don't see any signs that we're at the end of the road on new ideas on the technology side and continuing to improve and continuing to get more efficient on the drilling, which has led us to more wells online this year than we had in our plan. I talked about that last quarter.","That's one of the things that increased our CapEx on this year was we drilled more wells with the same number of rigs, so we got more wells to complete more production, but it does increase \u2013 has increased \u2013 one of the things that's increased our CapEx this year. So we're working on all of that for next year. And that's part of what we'll be talking with you about in December is the details around the CapEx plan and the production volumes that we expect.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I appreciate the opportunity to ask question here. So, the Big 3 up 48% year-over-year, certainly a surprise relative to our model. I was curious how those numbers were tracking relative to your own expectations. And any thoughts in terms of which of the basins are sort of surprising. And then, any early thought in terms of growth levels for the Lower 48 going into next year given your views on activity.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So Paul was onto some of the things I was just talking about. If you look at the \u2013 with the Big 3 is at 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the third quarter, that's up over 100,000 barrels a day from the same quarter last year. So that's the 48% growth that you're referencing.","I should start out by saying that about 10 points of that is kind of a Harvey effect. So, really, to really get a more proper year-to-year look since we lost about 15,000 barrels a day in the third quarter last year due to Harvey, it's really more a 38% year-over-year growth third quarter to third quarter once you adjust for the Harvey effect.","That's consistent with \u2013 last quarter, we talked about that same number was 37%, was lower in the first quarter down around 20%. But we've \u2013 that's what continues to support this idea that we're going to have about 35% growth year-over-year from the Big 3 this year even at the kind of capital levels we're at.","And that has been led by the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford is 75,000 barrels a day of that 100,000 barrels a day year-over-year in terms of increase. The Eagle Ford's up 61% versus the same quarter last year, 44% once you adjust for Harvey.","So, I think that we have gotten some extra benefit this year. Some of this is outperformance from what I talked about in the past, the Vintage 4 completions doing better than we \u2013 even better than we had expected. But it's also more wells; more wells online because we've been more efficient with our drilling. And so, as we lay out our plan for next year, we'll see what kind of numbers that produces.","But I don't expect that we can continue to run the similar number of rigs that we talked about in the analyst meeting and generate a 35% CAGR over time. The math doesn't work that way. You're not going to get that kind of performance even with the outperformance that we've had.","And of course, as we talked about on the last quarter call, some of this increased volume is due to the little bit higher spending on OBO, the operated by others, in Lower 48. I mentioned about a plus 7 on the last call in 2018 is from some of the increased OBO spending. That's not a huge piece, but that is part of the Lower 48, Big 3 outperformance on production.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, Al. The follow-up is what's the team's message around M&A? It seems like you got a nice organic opportunity set here with Alaska and Willow and Qatar, and obviously the runway that you were just talking about in the Big 3, but how do you think about Conoco's role of consolidation? Or is the most \u2013 is the P50 case still that you prosecute those organic opportunities?","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Well, we're pretty happy, Neil, with the organic opportunity set. And you probably get tired of me saying this, but we kind of think of M&A in three brackets again. And we've been executing the first two buckets over the course of last couple of years as we've kind of got the company back on its front foot a little bit.","And that's acreage buying, what we did up in the Montney, what we did in the Louisiana Austin Chalk. We're doing some of that each year every year, year in, year out. And now, we were afforded the opportunity to do a little bit of asset-level work, which is kind of how I think about Alaska with respect to the Western North Slope, the agreement that we're trying to close on Kuparuk.","And we look for those opportunities. We're patient. We're persistent. We'll only pay the right price when we have an extra opportunity to improve the portfolio. And we think we did in that particular case, quite a lot, with some good adds; and getting control of our development piece over that part of the area.","Now, I think you're probably referring to the large M&A and that's kind of a tough hurdle in the company because it needs to be substituted, it needs to be competitive on a constant supply basis. And with the current prices, they're still pretty frothy for large companies or small companies and some of the bigger deals that are going on right now. But we watch them, we look at them all, and we know what we like. And we're patient. We're persistent. We believe that this business is going to go through cycles. And we'll always look at it and have an opportunity when another down-cycle occurs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just had a quick follow-up on the Lower 48 activity plans. Last quarter, you talked about shifting a rig out of the Delaware to the Eagle Ford. And I just was wondering, as you're going through the planning for 2019 and even longer term, what would you need to see to begin to reallocate more investment or more activity to the Delaware? What you're seeing in realizations locally there?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. So, we did execute on that shift of one rig from the Delaware to the Eagle Ford that we talked about on the last call. And we also did lay down a conventional rig in the Permian that we talked about on the last call. So we have done those things that we talked about. I don't see us moving a rig back to the Delaware. I don't expect that that will be in our plan for 2019.","I think it will be most advantageous to do that once we see the takeaway capacity issues in the Permian getting settled out. And we, really, with the flexibility that we have and all the great opportunities we have in the Eagle Ford, we're not in a hurry to do that. And so, I think we'll use our flexibility and take our time just like we talked about on the last call in deciding when to move back. And I don't expect that it's going to be anytime in the immediate future.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Makes sense. And a second question I had is really a higher level one around the philosophy on dividend growth given the bump we saw recently. How should we think about, given the strong free cash flow profile that you guys have right now, the low overall cost structure, what you view as a sustainable dividend level? And I was thinking about the cadence of growth there over the next few years or even longer-term?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, Devin, we wanted to kind of move to a fourth quarter dividend. It fits better with the cadence in the company and how we review our plans with the board, strategy \u2013 set our plans for the upcoming years. So, fourth quarter, it feels like a better cadence for us going forward.","I think as you think about the dividend, I think it ought to be predictable, consistent and reliable, and you ought to count on increases on an annual basis. And so I think what we've tried to describe what we've done over the past couple of increases should be a fairly good predictor going forward.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Devin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Simmons & Company.

Lance - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Blake Fernandez - Piper Jaffray Simmons","Production sharing contracts have become more topical as of late and I've never really viewed Conoco as overly exposed there, but I just wanted to confirm there are no lingering hand grenades out there, I guess, that we need to address imminently.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. Let me cover that one. If you look out say 10-plus years in our list of PSCs, we've got three that expire in the next 10-plus years or so. And they've all been disclosed previously in our fact sheets. So, there's really no news there. But the nearest term one is in China, Panyu, which was originally set to expire this year. We recently, not too long ago, negotiated a one-year extension, but it expires in September next year. That's about 5,000 barrels a day, net to us, so not a big volume item.","Then, of course, there's Bayu-Undan that supplies the Darwin plant. We've been talking about that for a long time that we're going to be out of gas in that field out in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. So, basically, the production there goes to something approximating zero about the same time that the license ends. And then, we have Corridor in Indonesia, which we recently applied for. That PSC expires in 2023. Production will be down quite a bit from where it is now by the time you get out to 2023. It would be relatively low.","But we have applied just recently for an extension to the Indonesian government for that license. And we haven't \u2013 we've been in a dialog with them, but we don't have an answer there yet. But those are the three for us in the next 10-plus years that are on the queue for expiration. But, all-in-all, I'd say they're all either low production or they're going to be low production by the time we get to the expiry date, so it's kind of a non-event for ConocoPhillips as you suspected.","Blake Fernandez - Piper Jaffray Simmons","Thank you, Al. I appreciate that. The second question, this may be more of a Don question, but I guess it's more modeling-oriented, really kind of two-fold. One, can you discuss the over-lift in the quarter, specifically, where that was and how we should think about kind of that going forward? And then secondly, just on the tax rate, the adjusted tax rate has been moving down progressively each quarter. I suspect that's because of U.S. growing, but I just \u2013 any thoughts on how we should think about that moving forward?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, Blake, as far as the over-lift on the quarter, it's about 13,000 barrels a day. Most of that was in Alaska. And yeah, it's coming from an under-lift position in Alaska in the second quarter. And as far as going forward, I would say on the year-to-date, we're pretty well balanced, actually a little bit under-lifted on the year.","So, as you think about the fourth quarter, I can't really give you any guidance. I can't think of a reason why anybody would project an over-lift or an under-lift. So, as far as we're concerned, our expectation today is that sales and production would be pretty evenly matched. Of course, things can change late in the year as far as cargo liftings, but we're not in an over-lifted position on the year.","Blake Fernandez - Piper Jaffray Simmons","Okay.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","And on the effective tax rate, you noted that our effective tax rate has gone down 2 points. I think it was 39% on an adjusted basis and maybe a little bit lower, 36% or so, on a reported basis. I think that we did have higher pre-tax income in our low tax jurisdictions and in our equity affiliates which clear their tax at the affiliate level than we did in the higher tax jurisdictions during the third quarter. So that really kind of brought it down.","39% is within the range of my expectations. I think when we look at our jurisdiction mix and our production mix, generally, kind of expect it to be in that 38% to 42% most quarters, so not really a surprise there. And as far as the reported being lower than the adjusted ETR, that was mainly driven by the Venezuela settlement. So that $345 million or so has very low tax consequences to it, and so since we reported that as a special item, that brought that ETR down to 36%.","Blake Fernandez - Piper Jaffray Simmons","Helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I think this question's for Al. You stated obviously you've some good results in the Eagle Ford. I think you're probably, what, producing around 200,000 barrels a day net in that basin. As you look forward, what do you think? And this is an all-time record, if I'm not mistaken for you. What is your capacity to continue to grow there? Where do you think it could get to? And is there a point at which you guys are going to be more of a sustenance mode there or is that quite a ways out?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. You're right, Scott. We are at about 200,000 barrels a day. In the third quarter, we had made 198,000 barrels a day in the Eagle Ford. And we have recently signed up for additional stabilization and takeaway capacity there because the Eagle Ford has grown faster this year than we had originally projected we've had to sign up court earlier.","But I think I mentioned this on a previous call that third-party capacity was readily available in the Eagle Ford given all the shift of others to the Delaware. And so, we found that we can continue to grow without having to spend much money on infrastructure because it was overbuilt by others.","So, there's still more room for us to run there and more room for us to grow. I'm not going to predict an exact number, but we certainly \u2013 we're not in the flattening out mode like we have talked about in the Bakken where we were looking to kind of hold steady. The Eagle Ford is going to continue to grow for quite some period of time. It's not the \u2013 the flat spot on is not in sight. It's not something that's going to happen next year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks. And one question on Cenovus ownership. What are sort of the current thoughts? Anything changed on that? And I know you all are patient in the way you look at things, but can you frame for us how you think about that right now?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, Scott, there's really nothing new. We talk about this every quarter, but we do have a value expectation on Cenovus. We've said before, I think, that we felt like it was undervalued. Looking at the price today, we think it's even more undervalued.","So, fortunately, our liquidity position, our cash balances afford us the opportunity to be patient. We think Cenovus is on the right track. Obviously, we've got some headwinds with the transportation takeaway issues up there. But we think they're doing the right things and we think the market will eventually reward them.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Scott. And Christine, this is Ellen. We'll take our last question now, if you don't mind, so we respect people's time.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick one about the LNG in Australia. With Brent close to four-year highs, what has been the response in LNG pricing in the spot market? And how, just as a reminder, is your off-take agreement structured vis-\u00e0-vis the slope versus Brent?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good try, Pavel. I'll try to take that one, but you know we don't provide information on the slopes and exact pricing. I think the furthest that we'll go is to confirm that all of our LNG contracts, Australia and elsewhere, are Brent-linked. And so we're not going to get into the details of that.","As far as the commitments that we have in Australia, our customers are in both China and Japan. They're long-term contracts. Again, they're Brent-linked contracts. Generally speaking, the buyers have some flexibility in how much they take in any one year, so they may in any particular year vary their commitment down by 10% or up to 10%.","LNG demand, as you know, is quite strong, so our largest buyers are in China, are looking at taking their full commitments as we go forward. So what the long-term commitment off-takers don't take, we do sell into the spot market and we've been pretty pleased with the spot prices that we've received so far this year.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah. I can add, Pavel, that we've had about \u2013 we've been averaging about two cargoes a quarter of spot cargoes. And like Don said, we've been quite pleased with the pricing we've been getting on those the last few quarters.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And what percentage is that of the LNG volume?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","We had 29 cargoes in the third quarter, 87 year-to-date after three quarters, so it's less than 10%.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Clear enough. Appreciate it, guys.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Pavel, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. By all means, reach back to us if you have any questions and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you and thank you, Christine.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Christine, and greetings to everybody. Joining me in the room today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP of E&P.","Really three quick very administrative points before we launch into our remarks here, we will make some forward-looking statements this morning. The risks and uncertainties in our future performance are covered on page two of today\u2019s deck and in our periodic filings with the SEC. This information can also found on our website.","Next, if you haven\u2019t done so, save the date for our 2015 Analyst Meeting on April 8th in New York City. We will be providing some additional logistical details on that event soon.","And then, finally, during Q&A this morning, we are going to limit questions to one with a follow-up, so we can accommodate the call queue, we appreciate your support there.","So, now let me turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Ellen, and thanks to all our call participants this morning. So I will start by making few quick comments about 2014. Then I will jump into our view of 2015 and the actions we are taking to manage through this current period of very low prices.","Of course, we are also spending a lot of time thinking about the future beyond 2015. It\u2019s bit early to talk about -- that today, but as Ellen mentioned, we will speak to that at our April Analyst Meeting, where we will be ready to address our longer term view of the sector and how we are positioned to succeed.","So if you turn to slide four, this is our company level set in chart that we show during every quarterly call. Certainly, \u201914 seems like old news, but I think it\u2019s important to spend a minute recapping our results for the year.","Operationally, we hit our volume targets and achieved 4% year-on-year growth and I think that\u2019s pretty big accomplishment for a company our size. The growth came from the startup of five major projects, ongoing ramp up in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and a successful turnaround season across our operations and we also discovered two new oil plays in Offshore Senegal.","Financially, we generated $6.6 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.30 per share for the year. This includes fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $742 million or $0.60 a share. Obviously, reflecting weak fourth quarter prices. We ended the year with $5.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and also exceeded our price normalized cash margin growth target with more than an 8% improvement.","On the strategic front, we achieved a strong organic reserve replacement ratio of 124%. By the way the three-year average organic reserve replacement ratio is 153%. We completed the final piece of our announced asset disposition program with the closing of the Nigeria sale and we increased our dividend by 5.8%.","That\u2019s a quick summary. The key takeaway here is that we did what we said we would do, not just in \u201914, but also over the past three years since the launch as an independent E&P company.","We executed our stated plan almost to the letter and in the last quarter oil and gas prices began their accelerated decline. So let me discuss what that price decline means for our company in 2015 if you will turn to slide five.","There is a lot of debate right now about the duration of the current low oil prices. But we are assuming that they will stay low for 2015 and we are taking decisive actions accordingly. Our actions are driven by our priorities, which are unchanged since the time of the spin.","The dividend remains our top priority for capital allocation. The next size priority remains getting to cash flow neutrality in 2017. With these priorities in mind, we are going to use our capital and the balance sheet flexibility to manage through this downturn.","So, first CapEx, this morning we announced a further reduction in 2015 capital to $11.5 billion. That\u2019s a $2 billion lower than the $13.5 billion that we announced in early December. This means we cut capital by a third relative to 2014\u2019s spending.","In making these cuts we are exercising flexibility we have built over the past few years coring up the portfolio, adding scalable unconventional inventory with the low cost to supply and executing the vast majority of our major project spending.","And that\u2019s why we can adjust our capital program, while preserving future investment opportunities. And in 2016 you will see more capital flexibility as additional major project spending continues to roll-off. At our revised capital level, we still expect to deliver 2% to 3% growth in 2015 versus 2014.","Now in addition to conserving capital through scope reductions, we are aggressively identifying and capturing cost savings through our supply chain efforts. At this time, our revised $11.5 million budget anticipates capturing about $500 million of deflation in \u201915. Most of this will come from our Lower 48 unconventional business.","Now my management, myself, we review two dozen categories of costs globally every month and we are actively pursuing additional cost reductions for this year and beyond. As one of the largest purchasers of industry goods and services globally, we expect to benefit significantly in future years before any sustain deflationary cycle.","We are also looking beyond supply chain to reduce costs through self-help efforts. As an example in Europe, we recently announced operating cost and G&A reductions, and we will see additional cost reductions that are being implemented across the rest of the company.","In addition to managing OpEx and CapEx, one of the flexibility levers we are prepared to use in 2015 is our balance sheet. We are coming into this cycle in a strong position and that will serve us well. We have cash on hand and the significant capacity that we can use and Jeff will provide more detail on those plans.","So we are taking the 2015 challenge on. We are conserving CapEx. We are aggressively pursing supply chain and self-help cost reductions. We will utilize our financial capacity as needed. We\u2019ve adjusted rapidly to avoid jeopardizing our dividend or our ability to achieve cash flow neutrality by 2017. These decisive actions combined with our flexibility should put us in a good stead to manage through this downturn.","So, now let me turn the call over to Jeff and Matt and then I will come back for a few closing comments.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks, Ryan. As Ryan mentioned, our full year 2014 adjusted earnings were $6.6 billion, our full year earnings slide is in the appendix, but I will quickly cover fourth quarter earnings.","Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $742 million or $0.60 a share. Our operational performance was overshadowed by a roughly 20% drop in realized prices compared to prior periods and a previously announced dry hole in Angola. Our segment breakdown of earnings is shown in the lower right with more detail provided in the supplemental data on our website.","There is one special item to note, in the fourth quarter, an agreement to terminate our long-term obligations at the Freeport LNG terminal took effect. The ins and outs for the income statement and cash flow are shown in the appendix, but as a result of the transaction, the company anticipate saving about $50 million per annually over the next 18 years, so this was a good long-term economic decision.","On slide eight, I will cover our 2014 production from continuing operations. We achieved two important milestones in 2014, namely, hitting our growth targets for production and margin growth.","Our production growth for the year excluding Libya was 4% from 1,472 to 1,532 BOE per day. The impact from downtime and dispositions was small and compared to last year our net growth was over 60,000 BOE per day, primarily from liquids in area with favorable fiscals.","We also achieved our cash margin growth target and that\u2019s shown on slide nine. For 2014, we achieved an 8% cash margin improvement when normalized on 2013 prices. Despite lower prices, we are not going to lose our focus on cash margins and in fact, it\u2019s as important as ever.","Next, I will review our 2014 cash flow waterfall on slide 10. We started the year with $6.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and generated about $16 billion of cash from operating activities. We captured about $1.2 billion of net proceeds from dispositions, mostly from Nigeria. Our 2014 capital expenditures were about $17 billion. After accounting for dividends and debt, we ended the cash -- we ended the year with $5.1 billion in cash.","Next, I will address the balance sheet flexibility we are prepared to exercise in 2015 as needed. So please turn to slide 11. We've consistently spoken in the last several years about our plans to grow at a moderate rate, while paying a strong dividend to our shareholders.","The growth in our cash flow was moving us to a position where cash from operations would fund our capital and the dividend in 2017, with the shortfalls in cash flows funded largely by asset sale proceeds. With much lower commodity prices, we like the rest of industry need to manage in an environment with reduced cash flow.","As Ryan mentioned, even with this dramatic downturn, we remain committed to our strong dividend and reaching cash flow neutrality in 2017. And that's true across a wide range of commodity prices. As Ryan also noted, the first action we\u2019ve taken is to exercise flexibility in our capital program, which becomes more flexible over the next couple of years.","To achieve our priorities, we will also be using our strong balance sheet capacity, both cash balances and increased borrowings to provide funding this year and next. So let me tell you how we are thinking about this? We ended 2015 with $5.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and we need about a $1 billion of that cash to operate the company. We don't have any issues with trapped cash that prevent us from accessing our cash balances.","We have ready access to the credit markets and our debt continues to trade at levels between those of A and AA rated companies. The chart on the right shows indicative borrowing rates for any new issuances in today\u2019s markets. For short-term funding, we have a $6 billion of revolving credit facility capacity that can serve as a backstop for the issuance of very low-cost commercial paper. We don\u2019t have any debt maturities in 2015.","As we assess commodity price environment, both in 2015 and for the next few years, we think it\u2019s unlikely that we will need to increase our debt to a level that would cause our credit ratings to slip out of the single-A credit rating range. Although, it could move lower within the A range, if we stay with the current commodity price environment for a long period.","Our current debt-to-capital ratio is about 30%. We are willing to let that ride if necessary, as we move the company to a balance of cash flows, capital expenditures and dividends in 2017.","So to summarize, we intend to maintain our strong dividend and continue exercising our increasing capital flexibility, to move the company to cash flow neutrality in 2017. Our level of capital spending, rate of growth and the level of debt that we maintain will be the variables that would be influenced by commodity prices.","Now, I will turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff. I want to begin my comments with a brief recap of 2014, beginning with the review of our reserve performance. These are preliminary numbers, but we don\u2019t expect any material changes when the final reserves are published in our 10-K.","We started the year with 8.9 billion BOE of reserves, repurchased 598 million and added 742 million organically. These additions came primarily from our Lower 48, APME and Canada assets. This resulted in an organic reserve replacement ratio of 124%.","We also sold 159 million BOE, mostly from Nigeria and ended the year with 8.9 billion barrels of reserves. That represents a total reserve replacement ratio of 97%. Over the past three years, our total reserve replacement has averaged 129% and that\u2019s after selling assets, which generated about $14 billion of proceeds.","So let me put that all in perspective. We were launched as an E&P three years ago with 8.4 billion barrels of reserves on the books. Over that time, we\u2019ve produced more than 1.5 billion barrels and sold over 400 million barrels and yet, we will exit 2014 with 8.9 billion barrels of high-quality reserves on the books. That\u2019s pretty impressive for a company of our size.","Now, I want to recap the 2014 operational highlights that contributed to our reserve performance and a 4% production growth. As Ryan and Jeff mentioned, we achieved our production growth target, both for the fourth quarter and for the year. Our base assets continued to perform well, with strong safety performance and successfully completed several major turnarounds across the portfolio.","We achieved another strong year in the unconventionals, with 35% annual growth in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. We also conducted multiple pilot tests and progressed exploration and appraisal activities across our whole unconventional portfolio. And as a result of this work, we are confident that we have an extensive profitable engine in this place for many years to come.","We achieved startups of five major projects across the business: Britannia long-term compression in the U.K., Foster Creek Phase F in the oil sands and Gumusut, Kebabangan and SNP in Malaysia. And we made significant progress on our largest major projects at APLNG and Surmont 2 in preparation for startup this year.","We saw progress in our deepwater program and particular with two discoveries in the new working petroleum system, Offshore Senegal. And we continued appraisal of three major discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico. Yesterday was announced that we signed an agreement with Chevron and BP to jointly explore and appraise a 24 block area in Keathley Canyon. That includes a Tiber and Gila discoveries.","This agreement allows our companies to combine our technical strengths and financial resources to achieve efficiency through scale, which is subsurface risk and improve the likelihood of commerciality. So this is a great deal for all three parties.","Next, I will review the capital reductions we just announced and the implications for 2015 activities. We will start from the $13.5 billion capital guidance we issued in December. We are not reducing our base maintenance capital because we don\u2019t want to jeopardize the strength of our base production or the integrity of our assets.","Our development program spending will be lower by about $1.4 billion. Most of this is coming out of Lower 40 unconventionals where we have a lot of flexibility and where there is a sound economic rationale for slowing the pace of development.","In 2015, we will reduce rigs in the Lower Eagle Ford -- in the Lower 48 by over 60% versus 2014. We plan to run six rigs in the Eagle Ford, three in the Bakken and two each in the Permian conventional and unconventional.","At these levels, we maintain our land position via longer-term rig commitments and can continue to progress key pilot tests. We retain the flexibility to increase activity in this place of reduced. We are also reducing capital for our major projects by defending final investment decisions in several conventional assets.","Just as a reminder, our initial budget of $13.5 billion already reflected a significant reduction in this category compared to 2014, as projects were completed and as we near startup of APLNG and Surmont. We also exercised $300 million of flexibility in our exploration and appraisal spend, primarily in the emerging Lower 48 unconventionals.","As Ryan mentioned, our $11.5 billion capital guidance assumes about $500 million of cost deflation. This is why we have a clear line of sight to capture in 2014 but is early in the year and you can be assured that we have a significant focus on this effort across the whole value chain.","In 2016 and \u201817, the flexibility of our capital portfolio continues to improve as more major projects are completed. And we believe that flexibility combined with the strong base portfolio positions us well for a potentially volatile few years ahead.","Next, I\u2019ll quickly cover our operational priorities for 2015. We expect to grow production by 2% to 3% from 2014 to 2015. And this includes an expected first quarter production rate of between $1.57 and $1.61 million barrels per day.","Walking through the segments, in Alaska, we\u2019re focused on progressing our development drilling programs and major projects at CD-5 and Drill Site 2S. Both projects are expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year.","We intend to sanction the first phase of the Northeast West Sak development, the 1H NEWS project and we\u2019ll continue to progress a new rotary rig and new coil tubing drilling rig to optimize our long-term development drilling inventory in Alaska. But we have decided to defer final investment decision on the GMT1 project.","New onshore Lower 48 unconventional activity will slow across the portfolio relative to 2014. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate pilot tests including the upper Eagle Ford with our triple stack development concept. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019ll continue to appraise existing discoveries. We have wells drilling at Gila and Tiber right now and anticipate additional appraisal well drilling in Shenandoah later this year.","In Canada, we are adjusting our conventional and unconventional development drilling activity. Oil sands production from Foster Creek F will continue to ramp up. Surmont 2 is on track for first steam in mid-2015 and will commence exploration drilling offshore Nova Scotia later this year.","In Europe, Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II continue to ramp up and we\u2019ll continue to progress on the Enochdhu and older projects. In the Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment, APLNG is on track for startup in the middle of the year. We\u2019re ramping up Gumusut in Malaysia and we\u2019re awaiting third-party pipeline repairs to have low production to ramp up at KBB which we expect to start in the middle of the year.","We\u2019ll also complete appraisal of the Barossa Field, offshore Australia. And in our event, in national segment, we\u2019ll continue to monitor circumstances in Libya, evaluate the results of our recent testing in Poland, begin appraisal work offshore Senegal and continue to execute our exploratory drilling programs in Angola and Columbia.","So again, another busy year ahead of us. And in any price environment, we\u2019re committed to safely executing our programs and delivering flexible growth for retaining high-value future auctions and inventory.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ryan for his closing remarks.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Matt. So let me recap what you\u2019ve heard today. I think we delivered again in 2014. But certainly that was then and now it\u2019s all about 2015 and it\u2019s all about flexibility in Brazilians which we believe we have both.","Our priorities are clear, dividend and cash flow neutrality. And we\u2019re taking immediate actions to defend them. We\u2019re cutting CapEx, capturing cost improvements and exercising our balance sheet if needed. And we\u2019re also thinking about the timeframe beyond 2015. We\u2019re asking ourselves what's changed in our industry, if anything for the longer term.","We\u2019re testing our portfolio under different scenarios and again we\u2019ll see what -- we\u2019ll see that we have a resilient portfolio with flexibility to adapt if circumstances warrant. Now some things might change, but here\u2019s what\u2019s not going to change. We\u2019re going to allocate capital prudently. We\u2019ll continue to migrate our portfolio to a lower cost of supply. We\u2019ll maintain capital and financial flexibility and we\u2019ll pay our shareholders first.","That\u2019s our formula for creating long-term shareholder value. And I look forward to seeing you and describing that in more detail in April in New York. So with that, now let me turn the call back over to the operator and we\u2019ll take some Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Folks, I wonder if I could dig into the cash flow neutrality question a little bit because obviously the dividend is still a big commitment for you guys. When you separated Phillips, you -- I think Jim at that time had talked about maintenance capital level of around $10 billion to hold production flat. I guess what I'm trying to understand is to Matt's comments, obviously that was $100 oil. So one assumes that costs are going to drop at some point, but also had a slightly different portfolio and you've had a bunch of new projects come online a longer life or will come online rather. So what is that number today assuming -- as it stands today, and maybe assuming some cost reductions over time? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Ryan Lance","So I think the Doug, a number of $9 to $10 billion to keep production flat is a good go-by from that. It I mean, it clearly is going to be a function of how much deflation we see, this sustained deflation across the industry. And -- but the -- a number of that sort of magnitude is good go-by for the time being.","Doug Leggate","So, when you talk about cash flow neutrality, I don't know if this is either Jeff or Matt, but what commodity deck are you assuming when you think about that for 2017?","Jeff Sheets","That might be a comment that Matt made about capital. That also depends on what kind of cost deflation we see in both capital cost and operating cost. We don\u2019t expect that prices are going to maintain at current levels for that period of time. So we would be at cash flow neutrality at some improvement over current price levels but not at a level as high as what we\u2019ve experienced recently.","Matt Fox","So Doug, what I would say is that we see modestly rising price that go over the course of the next few years but certainly not back to a level that we see in the last two or three years.","Doug Leggate","Got it. My follow-up, if I may, Ryan is probably one for you. It's really more of a high-level strategy question because we could debate over the years what the market looks for out of Conoco. Your unique offering obviously is the dividend, but top line for a company of your size is always going to be relatively modest at best. So when you think about the trade-off between portfolio high grading, bringing new projects on and perhaps monetizing or exiting other areas, with the potential to buy back shares when you do get a windfall of oil prices as we may have just had the last several years. How do you see the strategic rationale of continuing to pursue top line growth in a volatile oil price environment as opposed to continuous high grading with a very strong yield and the option to buy back stock? I'm just kind of curious as to how this oil price environment changes your thinking. ","Ryan Lance","Yeah. I think as I look out, we probably should expect with some of the modest growth that we\u2019re seeing in demand and really the resiliency that we see and the unconventionals having an impact on the supply, we\u2019re going to be in a more volatile world as we go ahead. So as I think about that strategically for the company, we\u2019re trying to build the company that has a solid base of legacy assets, low production decline, the things that you can underpin the dividend with overtime.","So as we bring on the oil sands, our legacy assets in Alaska, what we\u2019re doing in Europe in the North Sea, what we\u2019re building in Asia-Pacific. And then on top of that, we\u2019re moving to lower cost of supply in the portfolio through the addition of the unconventional portfolio that we\u2019re developing here in North America. And that provides us a lot of resilience and flexibility to the capital.","So we\u2019ll see what you commodity price gives us, we\u2019ll protect the dividend first and then with what\u2019s left over in the cash flow, we\u2019ll fund a capital program that will set the growth that we see coming out of that because we know the growth is directly related to that capital program.","When it comes to share buyback, we will just assess what we have in terms of capital opportunities in the portfolio, if they are good, strong returns which we think they're going to be with the unconventional inventory that we have. We will judge that against the opportunity for share buyback down the road.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Ryan Lance","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson","Ryan, one of your competitors indicated today that service costs have not declined as much as might be expected given the decline in oil and gas prices. And while there is always going to be lag effects and different contract durations and other things, I want to see if you would elaborate further on what ConocoPhillips has seen in the market, and whether service costs lag effects were an important factor in today\u2019s reduction in spending, or there is lower prices? And then also some of the specific initiatives that you guys were undertaking that led to the $500 million benefit that you talked about a few minutes ago.","Ryan Lance","Yeah, sure, Doug, I can chime in and Matt is even closer to it than I am, so I can let him add some color to it if he would like. But we\u2019ve -- so as he said, we are seeing reductions as we -- as rigs start rolling off onshore, rig rates will be coming down. We are seeing pumping services and some of the commodities, and we are tracking each of those. We have 20 different categories that we track on the supply chain side, and we are looking at them pretty closely.","So a lot of those are coming to the capital side, some go to the OpEx side. What we said is we\u2019ve got pretty clear line of sight to the $500 million of reductions that we factored in, but those are going to continue as this commodity price environment continues into 2015 and depending on the recovery that we see coming into 2016. We are all over it. We are looking to try to capture as much of that as we can.","The interesting sort of piece that you get, although reductions and the flexibility that we\u2019re exercising is in North America and that\u2019s where we expect to see a lot of the first reductions from capturing the deflation. So I don\u2019t know, Matt -- I think that\u2019s where we are all over Doug and here is as much as we can out of it and as quickly as we can.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Well, thanks a lot, guys.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Doug.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. I would like to dig into I guess CapEx and flexibility or just a little bit more. And you cite your maintenance CapEx is around $9 billion to $10 billion. But when you sit back and look at kind of major project spend, as I think you cited, you\u2019re seeing a reduction in 2016, 2017. Can you give us a sense of what the size of that might be and how much you guys think you need to spend annually on those longer-dated projects, whether you have them today or you need to build them for kind of long-term growth opportunities?","Matt Fox","Well, as we move from 2015 and 2016, we will see about $2 billion coming out of our major capital projects, CapEx requirements just from Surmont and APLNG. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re referring to have significant increase and flexibility from '15 to '16 and that trend continues, the several hundred millions, not billions of barrels as we go from '16 -- billions of dollars as we go from '16 to '17, but that trend of reducing capital going to major projects and increasing capital going to the flexible low cost to supply development program. That\u2019s an underlying part of the strategy that we\u2019ve been executing for the past few years. And we are in the middle of that and adjustments to overall investment portfolio right now and for the next couple of years.","Scott Hanold","Okay. So if I can kind of clarify, if I look at that $11.5 billion 2015 budget, call it you will take out $2.5 billion for some of these major projects and that gets you to somewhat that maintenance capital level?","Matt Fox","That\u2019s the good way of thinking about it. And that\u2019s close enough.","Scott Hanold","Okay. I appreciate that. And one follow-up question then on your rig count reductions, obviously it was pretty meaningful in the U.S. onshore. And when you look at plays like the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian, can you give us sense when you are drilling your projects today, when you sit there and look at three, four and six rig counts, you assume that this will be economic at currency spot prices, strip priced or better price? And just to give you some context, I know there is a lot of debate whether or not the Bakken is economic today so why should there be any rigs drilling there today.","Matt Fox","Yes. So we are in the sweet spot of the Bakken and we can -- with the rig rates and the rates that we are getting, it\u2019s economic at current conditions, but we are actually taking that all the way down to three rigs this year. We do have some commitments within some of the units and the Bakken where we have to run some rigs in the Bakken.","The Eagle Ford is still very economic even at the current prices. But having said, it makes more economic sense to be fair. So what we are dealing with in the Eagle Ford is that a balance of, we have some commitments. We need to run probably three legs to meet commitments on our leasehold and we are also keen to continue to learn on Eagle Ford, because we have a huge inventory to develop over the next couple of decades and we want to make that we are capturing all the learnings.","So we\u2019ve chosen to continue with some of our pilot tests as we go through 2015. And our expectation is that some of the capital flexibility appears more into next year, they were likely to increase our rig count and take advantage of what maybe higher prices, but certainly will be deflated costs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin","Yes, hi. Addressing the service costs another way, are you getting discounts from book rates, or are you going to be able to get longer-term rates at discount, or is it too early regarding fracking the rigs, etcetera?","Matt Fox","So there is a mixture both going on John. I mean, this isn\u2019t a great time to enter into long term commitments. We waited until we see how the deflation works its way through the system, but we are working with the suppliers. We\u2019ve got great relationship with the suppliers and we\u2019re looking at across the spectrum of things influence the capital and operating cost and making judgments everyday on what the most prudent thing to do as in terms of contract duration and commitments against reducing costs that we are seeing.","John Herrlin","Okay. Thanks, Matt. One other question. It\u2019s a more volatile world. Given the short cycle nature of shale based activity, would you ever institute a hedging program for the shale or just given your size realistic?","Matt Fox","Yeah, I think the latter is the case John. With our size, we are naturally hedged across a lot of commodities and the markers. So given our size of where we are at, we don\u2019t see that is a useful strategy right now.","John Herrlin","Great. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber","Good afternoon, everybody.","Ryan Lance","Hello, Guy.","Guy Baber","I had question on your 2015 production. And I was trying to get a better sense of the general trend as we progress through the year, especially for the US unconventional portfolio. So could you help frame for us perhaps what kind of the 2015 exit rate production expectations might be for Lower 48 on the current capital spending plans and then any early expectations on 2016 with current rig count levels would be much appreciated? And then I have a follow-up.","Matt Fox","Well, Guy, I think you are really trying to focus in on unconventionals in that portfolio. So to give you a sense of that, we expect a production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken will grow from about 200,000 barrels a day in 2014 to about 225,000 a day in 2015, so somewhere between the 10% and 15% increase. That production growth is all going to come through the first half of the year. And then if we state the rig counts that we said just now, we\u2019re going again to a slow decline in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. Not a rapid decline but a slow decline and that\u2019s going to continue into early 2016.","So early 2016 average rate will be -- is going to be a function of the numbers of rigs we decide to run and we -- and as I said earlier, we do expect to increase our rigs in Eagle Ford and Bakken in \u201816, so production maybe flat from \u201815 to \u201916, but time will tell.","So, growing production on average year-on-year from \u201814 to \u201815, all of that growth is seen in the early part, the first half of the year and then a slow decline through the third and fourth quarter.","Guy Baber","That\u2019s very helpful, Matt. And then my follow-up, I wanted to kind of walk through some of the implications of the low rig count. And you partially address this in your prepared comments, Matt. But how do you think about reduced investment levels materially but still retaining the practical ability to quickly flex those activity levels higher if the commodity price improves?","And then secondly, can you just address just with the focus on minimizing spending and maximizing efficiencies. Your ability to still continue with some of your experimentation to drive a long-term recourse upside, I mean, are those plans still going to in place in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken as well with the lower rig count? So any comments you can provide there would be great.","Matt Fox","Yeah. So we -- the organization that we have in the Lower 48 is flexible enough to bring the rigs down and bring the rigs back up, if we want to do that. So that flexibility exists. And we\u2019re exercising our flexibility now and we done and we will be able to do it on the way back up again. So the organizational flexibility and the relationships with the suppliers and so on, that\u2019s all in hand to go both ways.","And in terms of the continued experimentation, yeah, we have to chock back somewhat on the pace of learning. We can\u2019t do all of the pilot tests that we\u2019d like to do, because you need to be drilling wells to do some of those. But the critical pilot tests that really have the biggest implications for our long-term resource and understanding. We\u2019re going to continue with those sort of pilot tests through this downturn because they have implications of the value of our information for the long-term. We think is worth continuing to collect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Hey, folks. Good morning. I have a question on slide seven. It looks like you provide the regional breakout of your adjusted earnings. And it looks, I hate to put a too much emphasis on just one quarter, but it looks like the Lower 48 actually saw a loss compared to the other regions and then, obviously, you\u2019re cutting CapEx in the Lower 48 as well? I guess my view is that that was one of the main drivers of margin expansion going forward? And so could you maybe elaborate a little bit on the economics that you\u2019re seeing there compared to the other investment opportunities that you have?","Ryan Lance","So, Blake, in the Lower 48 in the fourth quarter, there were around $100 million or so of an impairments that happened between and then also some dry hole cost related to the Shenandoah appraisal well that we wrote out as well, which impacted that loss somewhat.","But having said that, it will be a challenging year coming forward for Lower 48 based on the fact that there is still a fairly heavy natural gas weighting in the Lower 48 production. It is, as Matt mentioned, the economics are still there for continued investments that we are making and those are good cash margin investments. But it is going to be a challenging 2015 at current commodity price levels in the Lower 48.","Blake Fernandez","Sure. Understood. Okay. And then the second question is on the commitment to the dividend. I fully appreciate kind of the differentiated strategy and having that as a top priority? But you kind of mentioned debt-to-capita increase and potentially investment grade could go below AA or A? Is there a level that we should kind of think about where you begin to have to rethink that that strategy and emphasis on the dividend whether it would be investment grade rating or certain debt-to-cap level?","Matt Fox","As we mentioned in our remarks on call, we look at a lot of different scenarios that might happen over the next couple of years. We think between the capital flexibility that we have, the potential that we could have some level of asset sales in the mix and the cash balance that we\u2019re starting with. So we don\u2019t think, we\u2019re going to be having to face the question of having more borrowings than would take us out of that A credit rating range. With -- and again that\u2019s part of the overall message here is that that\u2019s baking in the dividend is the first priority for how we\u2019re using our cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys.","A - Ryan Lance","Hi, Paul","Paul Cheng","Good afternoon. And couple quick question if I could. Maybe this is for Matt and Jeff. If you are looking at your supply cost, do you have a rough percentage? How much of that supply cost is currently under contract longer than two years?","Matt Fox","Supply cost, you mean like our rigs and so on?","Paul Cheng","Yeah. Rig or anything that relate to your upstream operation.","Matt Fox","And well, in our North America business and certainly in Canada on the Lower 48, there is a very, very little that extends beyond one year. And in terms of rig contracts, most of them are 30 days, if we move to the international business, there is some in U.K. and Alaska there and Norway that are on longer term contracts than that. But it\u2019s typically, it\u2019s not common for us to have a significant amount of our drilling development led portfolio and constrained by long-term contracts.","Paul Cheng","So should we -- Matt, should we assume that more than 50% of your supply cost base that you could potentially not seeing cost reduction relatively quick timeline?","Matt Fox","Say that again. You are looking at the opportunities to get deflation and to \u2026.","Paul Cheng","That\u2019s correct. But how quickly that [indiscernible], because you have a lot of your surface is under long-term contract and maybe that you can negotiate even though that you are still under contract, but normally that people don\u2019t like to allow that, but -- so that\u2019s what I am trying to understand. How quickly is that the saving will be able to pass-through?","Matt Fox","So when me see it most quickly in the onshore and North American business in this and particularly in Canada in Lower 48. We\u2019re not going to see it, for example in the APLNG project. We are now almost a 100% labor cost. We\u2019re not likely to see labor cost in Australia decrease over the next year. And same applies really to the Surmont 2 project in Canada where that\u2019s all labor just now and we don\u2019t anticipate any significant labor cost reductions over the next few months as we complete the project. So the short answer is that the major projects are going to see limited and slower deflationary and forces act on them and the development programs everywhere, but in particular in Canada and Lower 48 are going to see it more quickly.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Second question, this is for Ryan. Ryan, understand your priority in protecting dividend. What is, as the industry under stress and there\u2019s a great opportunity of rise and you make a choice between making an acquisition, but that has to dramatically cut your dividend subsequently to ensure that you have sufficient cash flow going forward? What that, how that choice will be made from your standpoint? I mean, how you balance that?","Ryan Lance","Well, Paul, it\u2019s an interesting scenario to try to think about that, but it\u2019s a tough one to anticipate a little bit over because we\u2019re focused on executing the plan that we have. We watch the M&A market. We see the assets that are out there. The issue with M&A in our portfolio is it\u2019s got to compete against the investments that we have in the portfolio already today. And it\u2019s a pretty big hurdle for it to climb over. So, I wouldn\u2019t speculate on where that might go.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Maybe one follow-up on activity levels and balance sheet. I guess as we look forward into 2016 -- you probably implied on reaching the 2017 cash flow neutrality target, even if the current capital, CapEx balance and dividend rate would imply relatively significant ramp in cash flow potentially from commodity prices in the 2017, as is so. What would you need to see -- I guess in the market, either from a cost or from a commodity point of view to actually start adding capital back to the budget as apposed to just letting things play out through 2017?","Matt Fox","So what we said is that I mean, that we are going to have a lower capital to be flexible and to manage within our cash flow and maintain the dividend, so the capital is going to flex and we have the portfolio to allow that to happen. So when we say that we are going to get to cash flow neutrality in 2017, there is a bunch of different ways that that could transpire. It could transpire through higher prices with more capital and more production or lower prices with less capital and less production growth. So, we model all of these scenarios and we are planning to talk more about this, Ryan, when we have our Analyst Day in April.","Ryan Lance","The capital, Ryan, is the flywheel. So, again, we started with dividends being the number one priority. We\u2019ll fund that out of the cash flow. The growth will come from whatever capital level that we set in the commodity price and the cash flows informs that. And then we are setting that level to make sure that we reach cash flow neutrality by 2017. And as Matt said across very scenarios of combination of capital and oil price projections, we are focused on getting there in 2017.","Ryan Todd","Hey. I appreciate lots of moving pieces in the equation. Just trying to get an idea if there is a level that you would think about that would have to see, at least to actually star -- to star putting some money back into the business incrementally from what you have now?","Jeff Sheets","We won\u2019t let cash flow neutrality move out beyond 2017. So, I think that\u2019s the stakes you can put in the ground, Ryan.","Ryan Todd","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Matt Fox","It could move closer depending on the commodity price levels and what the market gives us.","Ryan Todd","That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask on the -- on what you are seeing on the cost environment. I know you talked a little bit -- am I correct in understanding that the vast majority of the $500 million CapEx catch that you\u2019ve implied in the budget today that have come in the U.S. and if -- and either way, can you talk a little bit -- we have a little bit more visibility, I think generally in what we see in the U.S? But can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing globally on cost across deepwater or major capital price and those types of things in the current environment?","Jeff Sheets","Well. I think, Matt\u2019s trying to address that. And we see it will be slower in the major projects and those like APLNG and Surmont that have a large labor component. That\u2019s going to take a long time to work through the system depending on how long the down cycle is .We do see deepwater floater rigs coming off quite a bit. So the market today is quite a bit less than it was just a couple or a year ago maybe this time a year ago. So we do see pieces of that tubular goods, Oil Country Tubular Goods, we see that coming down, and that\u2019s a commodity that we use across the world.","So where we have development in drilling programs, and we use workovers and stuff, we see some of that flowing through as well. So it is -- my category, it\u2019s different by each category, and it\u2019s different around the world. And the $500 million that we were talking about is something that we\u2019ve got pretty clear line of sight on to capture this year, and that will continue into \u201816.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yes good morning. Good discussions so far and I am going to have to stick with CapEx then ask some smaller questions. Just on the $4.5 billion of major project spend given that you do have APLNG heavy oil and some large projects in Malaysia that are going to finish hopefully at some point in \u201815. It might be a help to us to maybe give us some color as to just on the existing projects. How might that look in 2016, forget cost deflation, but just the timing of the -- CapEx cycle?","Matt Fox","So roughly speaking the -- we are going to see -- so let me give you some specifics. So APLNG will grow from something like $1.6 billion this year to 0 next year. Surmont will grow from about $800 million this year to about $250 million next year. So there is a tip that few have been sort of high level. And yes, few of those biggest projects -- so there are few projects that are increasing in capital year-on-year which has been the clear rich projects and as towards closer we\u2019ll see a slight increase in capital there next year.","And same with the Malikai project in Malaysia, but overall we are going to see something greater than $2 billion coming off the -- in the mix between those larger, the biggest projects we\u2019re executing, coming to an end, and some smaller projects that are already in execution ramping up a bit.","Edward Westlake","With the cash flow from those and then that provides more confidence to add back rigs into shell so...","Matt Fox","Well that\u2019s right. -- Actually you make a good point there. Because one other things about the projects like APLNG and Surmont for example, is they\u2019ll start producing this year. But it won\u2019t actually got to a peak raise for a full year until 2017. So they are going to be continuing to contribute the growth long after the capital spend even as the Surmont project takes three years to ramp up, APLNG won\u2019t actually get to peak production until some time early in 2016.","And the KBB project in Malaysia, we might only get half -- despite the fact of the project is complete, but waiting on this pipeline being appeared, we might only get half a year of production from KBB this year. But we get full year of production in 2015, and so on. I mean so this will be -- and we are happy that these major projects that they are getting to completion, not just because of that to spend the CapEx but because now we are going to reap the reward over the next several years of contributing, growing our base productions through these long life -- many of the long life flat production projects.","Edward Westlake","Okay.","Jeff Sheets","So little bit more point on Matt said as well. If you go back to our Analyst Presentation last April, we talked some numbers about how much cash, we are going to expect to see coming out APLNG and out of FCCL, once those things are up and running kind of a full rates by 2017. And those are lower numbers of oil commodity prices, but it\u2019s still a pretty significant source of cash for us. And that is an important part of the equation of getting the cash flow neutrality in 2017","Edward Westlake","And just on APLNG, just as a follow-up, how will you be treating, I guess, the CBM drilling cost? Would that be in CapEx or you put that in the OpEx just more of the modeling question. The maintenance CapEx on that project, which can be quite significant I think?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. Because the fact that APLNG is done with equity accounting for asset and you don\u2019t end up seeing the capital expenditure for APLNG or the operating costs for you to see contribution in current -- say the contributions going in as capital and we\u2019ll just see the distributions coming back out in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair Syme","Hello. I wonder if I could ask to what extent in this environment the OpEx and overhead might be the flywheel in terms of cash neutrality. If you could put some granularity around the comments you\u2019ve made about G&A cost would be useful?","Jeff Sheets","Yes. Alastair, we have talked a lot about the capital but we have -- we are equally focused on the operating cost here, as you would expect. And just like we are focused across the value chain per capital, deflation opportunities in capital, the same things happening in operating cost.","First of all, end cost are externally driven by contract, labor, materials, and chemicals, and there are some of that price sensitivity to transportation cost and some of our transportation contracts. But we got to look inside to for sale productions -- looking at internal operating cost and G&A. So we\u2019re ready to take in actions there. We have -- we really have no salary increases in 2014.","We got hiring fees in place across most of the company. We are ready for those plans to reduce headcount in Europe. That\u2019s quite significant. And we\u2019re likely to see more headcount reduction in other part of the business as we re-asses the implications of lower prices on a future plans.","So we\u2019ve the whole company focused on minimizing our operating cost and we\u2019re not going to leave any stone unturned. We\u2019re not going to take any measures that reduces the safety or integrity of our assets. And that is one of the things, Alastair, that we intend to talk about in more details at the Analyst Day in April, our approach to the operating cost side of the equation.","Alastair Syme","Could you say how much of your operating cost of supply given versus in terms of what percentage roughly?","Matt Fox","It\u2019s about, let\u2019s say, that it\u2019s roughly 30% as internal and a company labor. And then the rest is a mixture of transportation cost, contract labor, material, parts, about 30% is a ConocoPhillips internal employee labor.","Alastair Syme","Thank you very much.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Alastair.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reid of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Reid","Good morning.","Ryan Lance","Hello, Roger.","Roger Reid","I guess coming at the OpEx question slightly different way, we talked a lot about CapEx flexibility. As you think about the cash margin potential here, and I think about the share play certainly where they were probably a little more on the higher cash cost side, certainly looking across the industry.","So as you pull back a little bit on your drilling there as we look at some of the projects and probably more of a '16 than a '15 impact from APLNG and Surmont. But what do you think about cash margins as you look into the latter part of '15 and '16?","Ryan Lance","We expect the absolute level of cash margin will come down with the commodity prices obviously. But as we look at across the portfolio, most of the portfolio is quite resilient to -- on a cash breakeven basis it\u2019s pretty resilient to these prices.","So we are going -- as Matt said, we\u2019re going to continue to drive operating cost reductions as well as the capital reductions. And while the absolute level of margin will probably come down, we\u2019re still going to try to drive to see those margin improvements over the course of the next couple years.","Roger Reid","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a better question, April. But as you think about the exploration program here as part of the overall CapEx discipline and keeping the dividend in mind, flexibility obviously on the growth projects. What is the flexibility of exploration and what is the maybe incentive here as you mentioned with lower rig rates to shift things out another 6 or 12 months where you can?","Ryan Lance","Okay. So on the short-term aspect of that question in terms of the flexibility in our exploration spend, there is relatively limited flexibility in the short term on the conventional exploration activity. And we have rigs under contracts. We have agreements in place with the governments and the partners. So over the next year through 2015, that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t taken as much as you may expect, the exploration will really have to go to the possible exploration portfolio that is flexible.","So we are going to think the 2015 is actually a pretty big year for exploration in Angola, Senegal, Gulf of Mexico, Nova Scotia, for example, and Australia. And so we -- then as a longer-term question about the role of exploration and the growth of the company, and that\u2019s one of the thing, we\u2019re going to talk about more in the Analyst Day in a couple of months.","Operator","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Sorry, Christine, I'm seeing it's the top of the hour, we will take one more question if you don\u2019t mind, okay.","Operator","Okay. Our last question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick ones. One is just, the budget for this year, is it fair to say that the 11.5 is kind of set in stone at this point absent further deflation given that you have $2 billion rolling out for the next year and the 9.5 is kind of the core required spend? So if you got anymore this year, you would be kind of cutting into the data so to speak.","Ryan Lance","Yeah. We\u2019ve got a set the scope that we want to execute with the $11.5 billion. There is some uncertainty as to how much deflation we will capture this year. We\u2019ve added some in, could be more than that. We\u2019re certainly trying to drive to more than that. Yes, we\u2019ve set the scope associated with what we want to execute on the $11.5 billion.","Phil Gresh","Got it. And then just a follow-up. Just on the asset sales started, maybe any additional color you could provide around how you might approach the process like that? What parts of the portfolio might be something you would want to monetize in this type of environment?","Ryan Lance","Well, we continue to look. I\u2019ve said, we won\u2019t have another large announced asset disposition program, but you should expect us every year to be pruning the bottom part of the portfolio. Obviously, it gets tougher in this kind of commodity price environment. But we set our new base case. We know that the assets are worth to us internally.","And if there is interest out there in certain assets, we\u2019ll entertain those and look at them. So I think you should expect some modest amount. It will be tougher over the next couple of years, but of course there will be some pieces of our portfolio that we will be taking a hard look at.","Phil Gresh","So you think you can get $500 million to $1 billion in cash a year out of assets sales. Are any kind of target you are thinking about?","Ryan Lance","No, I don\u2019t really have a target in mind. We\u2019ll do what makes sense.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Okay. Christine, why don\u2019t you wrap it up here? And thanks everybody for your time. And by all means call IR if you have any other additional questions.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"6001":["ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call February  1, 2018 ET","Executives","Ellen DeSanctis - VP, IR and Communications","Ryan Lance - Chairman and CEO","Donald Wallette - EVP of Finance, Commercial and CFO","Alan Hirshberg - EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects","Analysts","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Alastair Syme - Citi","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Operator","Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Christine, and hello everybody. Welcome to today\u2019s earnings call. Our speakers today will be Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects.","Our cautionary statement is shown on Page 2 of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements during this morning\u2019s call that refer to estimates or plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide as well as in our periodic SEC filings.","We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today and as to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our energy and E&P company peers. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning\u2019s press release and on our website. Finally, during this morning\u2019s Q&A just to be efficient with our time, we\u2019re going to limit questions to one and a follow-up. ","And now I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Ryan Lance.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Ellen, and welcome everyone to today\u2019s call. We\u2019re excited about the release we issued this morning, in it we provided a summary of 2017 performance, but also announce several significant actions we\u2019ve already taken in 2018, that should send a very strong message about our commitment to saying discipline and continue to deliver our returns focus value proposition. ","For ConocoPhillips, our value proposition is an approach to the E&P business with same that delivering predictable performance and superior returns through cycles not chasing the cycles. Our strategy works when prices are below $50 per barrel like they were for much of 2017 or 60 plus per barrel like they are right now. The value proposition is focused on creating long-term value and winning back both energy and generalist investors to a sector that has underperform for far too long. ","Industry is in the early innings of the earnings season, but what you\u2019ll hear from ConocoPhillips today is that we\u2019re not only sticking to our disciplined plan we\u2019re building on it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll point out to you on slide number 4. In the middle column of this slide we\u2019ve listed the things we\u2019re focused on as a company namely having a low cost of supply portfolio, generating top tier free cash flow and returns, maintaining a strong balance sheet, distributing a differential payout to shareholders, growing cash flows via debt adjusted per share production growth and last but certainly not lease demonstrating leadership in ESG. ","On the left side of this chart, we\u2019ve listed some of the key 2017 achievements that allowed us to fully activate our value proposition across these focus areas, let me step through those now. As you know, we had a very significant portfolio reset in 2017. We substantially reduce our exposure to North American gas and oil sands with dispositions that generated about $16 billion of proceeds. Excluding disposition impacts we delivered organic reserve replacement 200%. Our lower sustaining capital and our pure leading sustaining price enabled us to deliver top tier free cash flow. ","At 2017 average print prices of $54 per barrel, our cash flow from operations exceeded CapEx by $2.5 million. Return to corner on profitability with full year adjusted earnings of more than 700 million. And more importantly, we are in a much stronger position to deliver improved cash and financial returns even at crude prices of $50 per barrel or less. ","We reduce our debt by almost 30% to less than 20 billion and improved our credit rating. We returned 61% of our cash flow from operations to shareholders via our dividend and buybacks. Last year, we grew the dividend 6% and repurchased 3 billion or about 5% of our shares. Underlying production grew on a per debt adjusted share basis by 19% and we continue to emphasize CFO expansion not production growth for growth's sake. ","We delivered on our operational metrics, while achieving one of the best years ever on safety and I\u2019m extremely proud of our organization for this, we can never take our eye of that ball. And in 2017, we announced a long-term target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a significant step forward demonstrating our commitment to ESG. So fair to argue that 2017 wasn\u2019t an exceptional year for ConocoPhillips, but we know that\u2019s the past and what matters now is what's next.","We laid out a 2018 plan a few months ago that was based on $50 per barrel WTI prices. So, the prices have moved quite a bit higher since then. So, the obvious question is will our plan change. The answer is no, not with respect to our organic investment plan. Our 5.5 billion capital plan is unchanged from what we outlined in November. Of course, that excludes the bolt on transaction in Alaska we announced this morning for 400 million. This is a very a very attractive transaction that allows us to consolidate our existing position on the Western North Slope where we have an ongoing development activity and an exciting 2018 exploration program currently underway.","Even with the higher prices today we believe it's critical to maintain discipline on our capital program, why, because that\u2019s the key to free cash flow generation and through cycle returns. While we would expect 2018 cash flows to be significantly higher at current prices we are not increasing capital activity. ","Instead of increasing CapEx we are following our priorities by allocating excess cash flow toward our dividend, our balance sheet and our share buybacks. We have already paid down an additional 2.25 billion of debt this year, we just announced a 7.5% increase in our quarterly dividend and we are up sizing our plan to 2018 share re-purchases by over 30% to 2 billion. By the way this represents a total of 5 billion in buybacks when combined with our 2017 re-purchases.","We are on track to deliver 13% production growth on a per debt adjusted share basis largely from activating our high margin lower 48 plan. Again, our goal is cash flow expansion from high margin volumes not growth for say. And we will stay focused on our ESG leadership throughout the year. ","So, while the outlook for the business looks better than it did just a few months ago we are not changing our plan. We are staying committed to our priorities and taking steps early in the year to deploy additional cash from the stronger outlook to our shareholders. 2017 was a very strong year for the company and we certainly intend to make 2018 another strong year by safely executing and delivering on our plans.","So, let me turn the call over to Don and he will discuss some of our financial highlights.","Donald Wallette","Before I recap the fourth quarter results I want to summarize some notable milestones since our November analyst and investor update. In December we reached the successful conclusion of our arbitration with Ecuador, allowing us to recover over $300 million. Also, in December we retired 1.3 billion of debt which took our yearend balance sheet debt to 19.7 billion. And as Ryan just mentioned we also front end loaded our 2018 debt reduction paying down a further 2.25 billion in January. Today our debt is about 17.5 billion.","In the fourth quarter we have re-purchased a $1 billion of stock and completed our 2017 buyback target of 3 billion. And finally, we have been evaluating the recent U.S. tax legislation and its overall impacts to the company. As you have seen in our news release we recognized a noncash benefit of approximately $850 million, primarily associated with revaluation of our U.S. deferred taxes to the lower rate. We\u2019ll also see an improvement in our earnings going forward because of the lower effective tax rate.","With lower 48 unconventionals and Alaska development being core to our capital program, the lower U.S. tax rate and enhanced capital recovery will further enhance the attractiveness of those investment programs. So as an active finish to 2017 and we're entering 2018 with the same strong conviction about our value proposition.","If you turn to Slide to 6, I\u2019ll cover adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. 2017 full-year adjusted earnings were about $740 million. This was an increase of around $4 billion compared to 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $540 million or $0.45 a share compared to the prior quarter, this was an improvement of about $350 million due to higher price realizations and higher volumes, partly offset by higher operating cost. ","Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted earnings improved by about $850 million, driven by higher commodity prices, higher underlying production and lower depreciation expense. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown on the lower right. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail on our segments.","If you turn now to Slide 7, I'll cover cash flow during the quarter. First, looking at the sources of cash shown in green, cash from operations excluding working capital was $2.5 billion. This includes a benefit of about $300 million associated with the Ecuador arbitration. Excluding this benefit, we were right in line with our published sensitivities.","The uses of cash are shown in red and we've already covered the debt reduction. On capital, I want to note that the $1.5 billion included about $230 million in land acquisition costs, which Al will cover in a few minutes. We also distributed $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of cash and short-term investments and we also hold 208 million shares of Cenovus.","Before leaving the quarter, I want to take a moment to make a few comments about realizations in the quarter and our leverage to price upside. We're not certain that the market fully appreciates our differential exposure to rent and similar premium markers. Partly due to our global diversification and partly due to the pricing of our U.S. production, our realizations correlate much closer to Brent than they do WTI.","If we look at fourth quarter about 83% of our global oil production was priced either on a Brent basis or a premium marker that\u2019s closely correlated to Brent. The evidence of that pricing advantage is shown in our crude oil realizations. Brent increased by $9.13 a barrel from Q3 to Q4 and our U.S. oil realizations increased by slightly more $9.50 whereas WTI weakened relative to Brent by over $2 a barrel. You can see that we don't have the same exposure to relative WTI weakness that other AMPs do. ","So, we are in a very strong financial position today, with significant leverage to rising commodity prices. We believe we have differential upside to prices because our portfolio is un-hedged, heavily weighted to Brent, and predominantly intact in royalty regimes, and we also benefit from contingent payments as a result of the recent transactions.","I want to leave the 2017 financial review with a slide that emphasizes our focus on free cash flow generation, and on our disciplined priorities. Slide 8, illustrates our priorities at work. ","Starting with the first set of bars on the left with Brent averaging just over $54 a barrel in 2017 we generated 7.1 billion of cash from operations excluding working capital. We spent 4.6 billion of capital which resulted in $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow generation power is a result of our low capital intensity, low sustaining price, and leverage to price upside. Either have these things or you don't and we do. ","The second set of bars shows the significant progress we made on our balance sheet and distribution priorities in a short period of time. In 2017 we generated 14 billion of cash in proceeds, cash proceeds. We used $11 billion of this cash to reduce debt and to fund buybacks. So, in the course of the year our portfolio and balance sheet were significantly transformed and our shareholders received more than 60% of cash from operations.","Lastly a reminder we provided 2018 guidance as well as earnings and cash sensitivities in the appendix of the deck. I want to draw your attention to two items that have positively impacted our income sensitivities. First, our 2018 DD&A guidance of 5.8 billion is improved by 1 billion versus 2017 actuals. The reduction is primarily the result of our 2017 dispositions and the reserve additions that Al will cover. Second our insensitivities also reflect the benefits of the new lower U.S. income tax rate.","With that I'll hand the call over to Al to discuss 2017 reserves and operational highlights.","Alan Hirshberg","Thanks Don. I'll begin on Slide 10 with a review of our preliminary 2017 reserves. Final reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February. We started the year with 6.4 billion barrels of reserves. We sold 1.9 billion barrels of primarily North American gas and bitumen reserves in 2017. ","Adjusted for dispositions our pro forma 2016 year-end reserves were 4.5 billion barrels. We produced 518,000 barrels and booked additions of 605,000 barrels. Excluding market factors this represents a replacement rate from net additions of 117% with an FND cost of less than $9 a barrel. ","In addition, market factors increased year end reserves by 431 million barrels for a total reserves addition of over 1 billion barrels. This equates to a 200% organic reserve replacement ratio excluding disposition impacts. We exited 2017 with over 5 billion barrels of high quality reserves as part of our 15-billion-barrel resource base that has an average cost of supply below $35 a barrel. This was good performance in a year, when we did not have additions from any major project sanctions.","If you turn to slide 11, I\u2019ll cover some 2017 highlights from our operations. 2017 was an exceptional year operationally. We had our best year ever on safety and environmental performance, while delivering 3% underlying production growth for $4.6 billion of capital. So, let me cover a few highlights. ","In 2017, the Lower 48 Big Three unconventionals hit an inflection point and began growing again. In the fourth quarter of 2017 production from the Big Three averaged 236,000 barrels per day, a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Also, in the fourth quarter, we acquired about 245,000 net acres of unconventional exploration leases and 3 different early stage Lower 48 plays for $235 million.","We\u2019re still coming -- we\u2019re still coring up these positions. So, we are going to say much more about them today. I\u2019m mentioning it partly to make a point that our fourth quarter CapEx included this capital. So, don\u2019t assume fourth quarter CapEx represents a run rate for 2018. ","Across the portfolio, we advanced several major projects including Alaska\u2019s 1H news that achieved first oil in November. In Norway, the first Aasta Hansteen well was spud in November, and the spud will be towed offshore in the second quarter of 2018. We\u2019re still on track to achieve first production before the end of the year. ","We also advanced our exploration efforts to two exciting areas Alaska and Canada. We completed the preparatory and permitting work to drill 5 exploration wells in Alaska this winter. In the Montney in Canada, we grew our 100% equity position in the liquids-rich part of the play to over 100,000 acres and achieved encouraging results in our early wells. And finally, we announced the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 5% to 15% by 2013. This is an important step in maintaining our ESG leadership.","So that was a very quick recap of 2017. If you turn to slide 12, I\u2019ll cover the 2018 outlook outlining some key catalyst to watch for in the coming year. As Ryan said at the beginning of the call, we\u2019re committed to keeping our discipline. We\u2019re sticking with the $5.5 billion capital plan we announced in November, while keeping an eye on inflation and working hard to mitigate those pressures if they come. We expect to deliver about 5% underlying production growth or over 10% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. ","The bar on the right shows the basis for underlying target as well as the expected range for full year 2018 of 1,195,000 to 1,235,000 barrels per day. Some of you may have notice that the midpoint of this range is 15,000 barrels per day higher than what we showed on our Analyst Day in November. That increase accounts for the fact that underlying 2017 production was 15,000 barrels per day higher than we had assumed at the Analyst day. We expect first quarter production to be between 1,180,000 and 1,220,000 barrels per day. I want to bring one item to your attention.","Early this year, our third-party pipeline outage in Malaysia caused the KBB field to be shut in. In the first quarter guidance range, we have assumed the KBB is offline for the remainder of the quarter. KBB's net gas production was about 25,000 oil equivalent barrels per day prior to the shut in, but we are not adjusting our full year production range for this outage.","A couple of quick comments on the production profile for the year. We will have the usual second and third quarter turnarounds in APME, Europe and Alaska so those segments will dip in the middle of the year and rebound in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile we expect our lower 48 big three volumes to ramp up to deliver the 22% production growth for this year that we showed you in November. ","The capital and production guidance I just provided does not include the impact from the Alaska transaction that we announced this morning. As you saw on the release we paid $400 million to acquire the remaining 22% working interest in our Western North Slope assets that we already operate and the 1.2 million gross acres of expiration development leases in the area, including the Willow discovery. We now own a 100% of these assets containing about 200 million barrels of gross reserves and about 900 million barrels of risk gross resource with gross production of about 63,000 barrels per day in 2017. We will begin reporting capital and production from this asset once we get regulatory approval. ","2018 will be another busy year and there are some important milestones ahead. Several projects are expected to come online before the end of the year including Bohai Phase 3 in China, Clair Ridge in the UK, Aasta Hansteen in Norway and GMT1 in Alaska. We will keep you informed on these throughout the year. We also expect to enter feed on the Darwin LNG backfill, which is an important step for production early next decade. We have several exploration programs underway and look forward to progressing those in Montney the low 48 and Alaska.","So, to close we remained focused on safely executing the disciplined plan we laid out in November delivering on our goals and keeping you informed during the year.","Now we will turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","During the past year or so ConocoPhillips and a few peers pledged to manage with value-based strategies and as returns on cash flow increased to return capital to shareholders, and this model is clearly being rewarded differently in the stock market. And on this point, I noticed that your spending rose in Q4 and you made a strategic acquisition in Alaska as well but based on Al's comment it sounds like which you consider these to be normal seasonal or maybe opportunistic type expenditures rather than an early-stage expansion of the spending program, is that the correct way to think about it?","Ryan Lance","Yes, Doug I think that\u2019s exactly the right way to think about it. We are sticking with our base program. We had an opportunistic Bolton opportunity in Alaska that we can talk more about if people have questions. But really that is a separate item from the base $5.5 billion plan that we have. ","In terms of the 4Q spending, we had the $235 million of land acquisition that we talked about in the quarter. And so that that brought the fourth quarter in hot, if you subtract back that out and take fourth quarter and multiply by four you get $5.1 billion. So, ex that, that was the pace we were on in the fourth quarter.","Donald Wallette","Our plan hasn\u2019t changed Doug, we're sticking as we said in our release, we're sticking to our $5.5 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","I want you to talk a little bit about the Alaska opportunity set. From conversations with investors, whether it's your existing portfolio or these bolt-ons or will others still a level of skepticism around the cost to supply of Alaska? So, can you talk about how you think about Alaska in the context of your cost of supply curve? And then a little bit more detail about the asset that you've built into the portfolio a little bit more today?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. Thanks, Neil. Although, Alaska has been one of our legacy areas for a long time for the company. Similar to other parts of our portfolio, Alaska has made some tremendous progress in lowering the cost of supply for the base business up there as well as when we look at the opportunity set for investments to grow and develop. ","So, despite us being in Alaska for forty years, the largest producer out there, we still see a lot of opportunity and in fact our production is flat to growing over the next five to 10 years, a lot of that's driven by things like the willow discovery and when we look at that it can piece very well in their portfolio, since that at a cost of supply that is very competitive to investments around the world and we have an opportunity. I think Anadarko was doing some things for their company to improve what they're doing. They had listed -- or expressed a desire to sell some assets and Alpine did one of those. I think we\u2019re the natural buyer because we operate and we have the majority interest in the area. So, we were able to come to terms with them and we think it's attractive for both companies in terms of what they're -- what we're each trying to go do. So, make it made a heck of a lot of sense for us to pick up that interest and be in complete control, 100% owner and control the capital pace and destiny over there. So, yeah, it made a lot of sense for us and it was opportunistic. So, we took the chance and came in doing terms with them.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate the comments. The follow-up is just the production guidance raised 15,000 barrels a day. It sounds like that\u2019s just rebasing off of a higher 2017 level. Where was the outperformance, was that lower 48, and if any comments there?","Donald Wallette","Yeah. So, you're right. That is just a rebase. There is a slide in the supplement that does the math for you, but of that 15 increase, 14 of it was delayed timing on asset sales that we assumed back at Analyst Day that were built in. And so, you just get a different base in the production that we had in 2017 and a little bit of it was a little bit higher performance as you saw on our fourth quarter volumes were a little bit above of what we'd assumed at the time of the Analyst Day. But it's mainly just rebasing off that higher underlying production in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","First question is just on the capital allocation, this will be for Don. So, Don, at the analyst day you guys were based in everything on the $50 WTI scenario obviously WTI is well above that now. But even if you just going up call it $10 on that assumption that the 2 billion or so more of CFO and the amount is incremental, buyback here is about $500 million. So, it seems like there is still a lot of extra cash available particularly if you are not going to be increasing activity or CapEx. So, could you just talk about how you think about that flexibility? And why the decision to raise 500 million versus a different number?","Donald Wallette","I feel like its maybe the important thing is to note that we are not going to get overly excited about the highest commodity prices right now. I think it's only been about 50 or 60 trading days since Brent broke $60 a barrel so there is a lot of volatility in the market as you are seeing. ","We are not changing our baseline; our plans are still based on the same plans that we showed you back in November with the $50 WTI type price. And I think even there we showed you that we had surplus cash bills at the end of the -- over the three-year period. So, we certainly have the capacity to increase the dividend as we announced this morning and also increased to 30% or have a 30% increase in our buybacks.","Alan Hirshberg","I would add Phil, that we recognize there's some cash flow generation potential above and beyond what we were showing you at the analyst meeting and I think we wanted to re-demonstrate our commitment to shareholders up top. So, you got the number right $2 billion of incremental cash flow as you go from 50 to 60 in our company and the shareholder got the first call on that through the dividend increase and the incremental $500 million of share buybacks. I'll just remind people follow our priorities. We are pretty clear as we outline then and that\u2019s what we are doing.","Phil Gresh","Very fair about where we are in the year. I guess just to clarify there is no desire to put more cash in the balance sheet and reduce debt below 15 billion or anything like that, correct?","Ryan Lance","No, not really Phil we are pretty clear on the $15 billion target by the end of 2019. We do feel like that\u2019s the sweet spot, you start going lower than that adjusting capital structure it really kind becomes inefficient I think and also expensive. So, we are pretty happy with the 15, kind of strikes the right balance for us.","Phil Gresh","And then my second question is just on the lower 48. If you could give the numbers for each of the three areas of unconventional and then as I look at that 2018 guidance is ramping through the year. Does that mean that you will have greater than 20% growth or you are ramping to a level of 20% growth through the year? I just wanted to clarify that.","Ryan Lance","We are going to ask Paul a question there for the first piece which is the by field breakdown so he will have something different. So, for first quarter -- I mentioned the 236 for the big three added together, Eagle Ford is 148, Bakken at 67 and Delaware was 21. So those together sequentially were up 25 over the third quarter or about 12% but that\u2019s not a very good number to focus on because we had Harvey deficit in the third quarter. But I think it is relevant to notice that it was up 10% quarter-over-quarter, fourth quarter of \u201917 versus \u201916. ","In terms of your question about how we\u2019re going to move through this year, the 22% is a full year \u201918 number versus a full year \u201917 number, that\u2019s what we were talking about at the Analyst Day. ","The exit-to-exit will of course be higher than that. In fact, I really expect as I look at the timing and the shape of the curve, we were doing a lot of bigger pads now than we were say a year ago more 6 and greater than 6 per wells per pad that make the production lumpy. And so, I don\u2019t expect to be ratable through the year. ","But to give you an idea, I would expect our Big Three to exit the year at over 300,000 barrels a day. So, if you kind of eyeball that with where we just were at 236 in the fourth quarter of last year, you can see kind of the pace that will be on. Even though, I don\u2019t expect that to be linear to the year. That kind of exit rate, you can do math and see that will be -- if you look exit-to-exit, it\u2019s a considerably bigger number than 22%. ","Phil Gresh","Why was Permian down in the quarter?","Ryan Lance","Permian is just lumpiness, it\u2019s just the timing of -- as we\u2019re doing this multi-well pads and when the different wells. When you\u2019re doing a multi-well pad, you got to drill every one of those wells, so you got to come back to complete every one of those wells before you turning to those wells on and of course your other wells are declining while you\u2019re doing. So, it was down 1,000 barrels a day, that\u2019s just, just this kind of lumpiness that you\u2019re going to see through the quarters I\u2019m talking about. So, when first quarter comes along, I don\u2019t expect over-interpret how that\u2019s doing. ","I know there has been a lot of -- in fact, one of the messages we heard from investors and analysts, since our Analyst Day some doubt about this 22% number. And I\u2019ve been scratching my head trying to figure it out. So, I tried playing analyst for a day and look back at things as we\u2019ve said before and did we give you some reason to doubt us? I would back and look at the script of the same call one year ago the 4Q \u201916 call to see what I said then. And I said, I thought the fourth quarter of \u201917 would be 5% to 10% than the fourth quarter of \u201916, because we were going to go through a trough there in \u201917 and then come up. And in fact, we hit the very high into that range 10% so that to give you confidence. ","And then I went back and look at the public data. The public data that you can pull on Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware, and you can clearly see that the production rates, the per well production rates of our wells are considerably higher in \u201917, they were in \u201916 and continue to improve significantly. And so even our Dakota rig that\u2019s moved up that we showed you at AIM has gotten even better since then. And so just, I\u2019m okay, it\u2019s good for you guys to be skeptical so we can prove you wrong later in the year. But there\u2019s just not any data out there that says we\u2019re not going to make it, I feel confident.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate ","So, Ryan, obviously oil, where it\u2019s standing right now, I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse here, but you know what's going to happen a year from now. I could still hear people are going to be asking why you\u2019re not spending more money. So, I guess, can I ask you maybe put you on the spot a little bit and you led us through your plans just three months ago. Should we anticipate given what Don said about his comfort with the balance sheet? Should we continue to have these kinds of windfalls over the next two, three-year period but that would be an incremental share buyback? And if I may just go to on the backend where the acquisitions fit in opportunistically otherwise?","Ryan Lance","Well I think Don said that there is 69 trading days since we approached $60, so I think we are not going to get over our [skews] too much but we are going to follow the market and you should assume that our capital plan and the scope that we laid out and the plans we laid out at the Analyst Meeting are pretty firm and disciplined within the company. So, we are not planning to change that scope. So, we are going to look at incremental opportunities as they become available and that's exactly what we did on the Alaska opportunity. And of course, the $400 million isn't included in that $5.5 billion. So, we recognize that is we execute our plans, then look at our priorities you have to think about how we are delivering money back to the shareholder, what we are putting back into the company and how we are growing and developing the company is the priority as you guide when you go do that. With prices hanging there, we will continue to evaluate as we go through the course of the year, over the next two or three years depending on what prices may do and if you follow our priorities you will see how we will act.","Doug Leggate ","My follow-up, I don't know if you will be able to answer this or if you would really like to answer this, but the $235 million land acquisition I guess has been described as an early stage so it doesn't sound like its Delaware. Can you offer any color as to what you are thinking there and as an add-on is this opportunistic or is this probably going to get some attention because it seems there is a lot of asset holders around the place whether it would be Delaware, Eagle Ford or whatever, they are likely to be asset sellers into this higher oil price environment? So, do you have a scale of where opportunistic acquisitions has kind of ceiling or you look at everything?","Ryan Lance","So, the acreage acquisition is early life exploration acreage in some unconventional plays around the U.S. We are still really actively trying to call that up, as I talked about. So, when I'm talking about -- because we are in a market today trying to build on some of those positions. So, we are just not going to speak to that today do that. On the opportunistic side we look at a lot, we look at a lot of assets, we look a lot of stuff on the M&A side and it just got to make sense and be creative in our portfolio and competitive on a full cycle basis. So, when we look at an acquisition we have -- we don't just look at the forward kind of spend that we think it's going to take and is that competitive. We look at that on a full cycle basis including what we have to pay for it. So, some of the hot stuff in the Permian Delaware basin that you know is expensive, and while we look at it, it's just not competitive in the portfolio at $30,000 an acre. But obviously we are not -- and some of these opportunities that we are buying there they are very competitive in the portfolio, make a lot of sense. We are [acquiring] up existing positions that we have and we look to do that more often if we got opportunities to do that.","Donald Wallette","Right we are able to do that if it's less than $1,000 an acre here when you divide the two numbers obviously.","Ryan Lance","Yes, so they make an incremental amount of sense for the long-term growth and development of the company.","Doug Leggate ","I probably just stretched to get the location but we will wait for that in the future. Thanks, guys.","Ryan Lance","It will come, Doug, we are just -- we are out there competing and we want to maintain our competitive advantage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys, good morning.","Ryan Lance","Good morning, Paul.","Donald Wallette","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Maybe, this is for Al. Al when we are looking at the U.S. onshore, the nominal pause is that we are seeing some inflation, but with the productivity gain, do you think that on a per unit basis that your unit costs you will be able to operate or that you are going to see maybe 2% or 3% increase?","Al Hirshberg","Yeah. So\u2026","Paul Cheng","And you can also maybe\u2026","Al Hirshberg","You are specifically asking about\u2026","Paul Cheng","I was going to say, you can also comment on international, I think the spot cost is no longer dropping, but do you have any contract being rolled so that your international unit cost may actually be down.","Al Hirshberg","Okay. So, you are really asking an inflation question I guess. Is that the main focus or are you interested in just Lower 48 onshore costs? I'm not sure where your focus was.","Paul Cheng","Yes, the combination. I mean we know that inflation in the onshore and I don't think we've seen any inflation in the international market, but\u2026","Al Hirshberg","Right. Okay.","Paul Cheng","But the productivity gain and also project [overall] just trying to understand, how that all ramp-up in terms of your own 2018 versus 2017-unit costs as a result?","Al Hirshberg","Right. So just to remind as where we've kind of been with inflation and deflation, when you look back for the full year 2017, when we do that math it did -- in the year with some inflation Lower 48 and some deflation internationally and when we add all that it comes to a negative $29 million. So, it was a slight net deflation, but you compare it -- so basically about a wash, but compare that to the past two years and in 2015, we had over $1 billion of deflation versus 2014 and then even after that $1 billion we had another $900 million of deflation in 2016 versus 2015. So, this was quite a change from the last two years to come out roughly even. In 2018, in our plan we are assuming some level of inflation is built into that $5.5 billion. But remember as we said during the Analyst Day that $5.5 billon was the amount of inflation we built into that was set for a $50 WTI world, that's the inflation that we have built in there.","Paul Cheng","And you are talking about CapEx side but on the cash operating costs?","Al Hirshberg","Okay. So, let me talk about our cash operating costs in 2018 versus 2017. Basically, what we're doing is after you adjust out for dispositions kind of one-time items and get to sort of our core pro-forma operating costs is 2017 and then take the unit costs of that with our volume excluding Libya and then what we're doing is holding our unit costs flat in 2018 to what we've accomplished in 2017. What that means is that we're going to have to offset any inflation versus 2017 ForEx pressures. Libya has been producing more and more and we're getting to where OpEx and Libya is alone is rounding to a tenth of $1 billion, it's getting to be significant and also, we have a heavy turnaround year in 2018 versus 2017. So, all of those are putting pressure on our unit costs and our plan is to offset all of those things with greater efficiencies in 2018 versus 2017 to hold our overall worldwide unit costs flat.","Paul Cheng","Okay. A quick follow-up, actually, no follow-up but a question on Alaska, the bolt-on acquisition if I look at the price you pay it seems like you pay for about $29,000 for daily bill of production capacity or maybe about $9 per barrel of the recovered book barrel if we are using 200 million gross. Those seems very low number. Is this any hidden cost in that that's why that Anadarko willing to sell at such a cheap price? I am trying to understand that is there any other thing that we need to consider when we are looking at those numbers? Those are great numbers.","Ryan Lance","No there is no hidden things in the deal, what you see is what you get. I think for us clearly this is a core strategic position for us in Alaska. We have got a lot of [Technical Difficulty] in drilling and exploration teams and the things are going to bring us in a Western North Slope going forward. Willow was early evidence of that, but with that over 1 million acres out there we have got a lot of prospectivity going forward. Remember I talked about our compressive seismic at analyst day we have got a compressive seismic shoot scheduled there this winter. So, there is a lot of interesting things that we see is upside that are core to us that I think for Anadarko it just wasn't a core asset for them. So, it's just a little different view of the property.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Al did I hear you say [approximately] in relation to the very strong reserves booking you had no major project expansions last year?","Al Hirshberg","That's correct, yes. So, to come in over 100% excluding the market factors in a year when we didn't have any major projects sanctions is good performance. And it was really driven by the Lower 48. I think that the improved recoveries just talking about you go look in the public data and you will see how much our wells have improved particularly in the Eagle Ford since our latest completion design changes. And that's not only given us higher rates, it's given us improved recoveries. And that combined with getting more mature on these Lower 48 unconventionals, so we have got more well history allows us to book additional reserves and our continuing lowering of unit costs also takes out further in time the economic life of these wells and allows you to book a little more. So those increased bookings in Lower 48 is really what allowed us to do that when you wouldn't have thought we have been able to without any major project adds.","Paul Sankey","Yes, times have changed Al. So, the outlook for the CRMs of sanctioned maybe for the next two three I guess you may be able to give us just an update on if there is other stuff in the pipeline?","Al Hirshberg","We showed you that pipeline at the analyst meeting that's pretty lumpy. And so, we will have some sanctions over the coming years, things like GMT2 that we would expect for next year. You have got the Darwin backfill that should come after that. And so, recall that what we said at the analyst meeting in November was that in any given year when you don't have any of those we might not make 100% but when you look at it over the next five years and average out those lumpy major projects adds that we will -- we would expect to be over 100%. In this case, I know we didn't have any -- we were over 100% for '17 anyhow.","Paul Sankey","And then if I could ask you a follow up. I don't want to be negative but there are fees of ForEx and higher oil price type effects in your OpEx cost gains if I understood your commentary on that. Could you just sort of try and give us a pro rata view of where you think that can get to let's say by 2019, I hope that makes sense? I mean you can keep driving it down without all the moving parts for the somewhat micro relative I guess.","Al Hirshberg","Well, I mean my expectation is that as we continue to grow our production that we are going to maintain our unit costs flat as we experience ForEx pressures, inflationary pressures. That we are going to offset those with continued improved efficiency, our operating teams have demonstrated the ability to do that. So, my expectation is we continue to be able to do that. The Libya thing is a little bit of a tough deal, because we don't count the Libya barrels in the unit costs that I'm trying to hold flat. But as they get bigger and bigger Libya now is producing about 3% of our total corporate production. But I'm not using the barrels in my unit cost calculation, but I am including the costs in my costs. So, like I said, it's getting to be a tenth of a billion now so it's -- we may to think about how we are doing that calculation some point. But that's -- I don't see anything come in that's going to keep us from been able to continue to hold our unit production flat.","Operator","Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alastair Syme","I absolutely agree with Paul, the underlying movement in reserves is a pretty impressive achievement in 2017. As the post, did you have a view on what would constitute an efficient reserve life for the business? Or do you think it's even realistic or right to measure efficiency around reserve loss as a metric?","Al Hirshberg","Well, I mean, I guess, if you look at our RP now with this latest, its north of 10, 10 to 11 kind of range. We think that's a reasonable place to be, but it's not something we are aiming for one way or the other. By selling some of our SAGD assets, that tends to shorten your RP, because those were high RP assets. A lot of what drives that is more mix of the kind of assets that we are developing. So, I think that we don't take any grand meaning from that particular number, we are not trying to manage it in one direction or another.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a point of clarification on the corporate tax reform stuff. Is there an impact to your effective tax rate and the -- is there use of the proceeds? Would you expect to repatriate foreign cash and if so will that just go into the mix in the balance sheet or whether there had be any use of those proceeds?","Donald Wallette","Ryan on the effective tax rate, sure, we'll see a lowering of the effective tax rate. The U.S. effective tax rate will go down about 12%, 14% or so. So, on a global basis that will probably push it down maybe 5% I would say.","Ryan Todd","Will that have any impact in 2017 on your actual taxes -- on your cash taxes [pays]?","Donald Wallette","Well as you may recall we are not in a tax paying position in the U.S. and probably won't be until early 2020, so it's dependent on price of course. So, we are not going to see any cash impacts or very small cash impacts until we recapture those historic losses.","Ryan Todd","And then\u2026","Donald Wallette","Sorry the other question was on\u2026","Ryan Todd","Repatriated cash?","Donald Wallette","Repatriation right, well there is two aspects of sort of repatriation of the cash. We don't expect to do -- to see that. We have always been able to access our foreign accounts without adverse tax consequences. So, there's really no change there. And then as far as the deemed repatriation on foreign earnings of course we have got a lot of historic foreign earnings but they will be deemed repatriation tax on that but we have ample foreign tax credits to offset any impact that would have. So, the net-net result is no impact from deemed repatriation.","Ryan Todd","And maybe can I just ask one on the Montney, I mean it's come up a few different times during the -- over the course of the presentation. I know at the analyst day you highlighted some of the incremental acres out there over 100,000 acres. Can you talk a little about what the plan looks like to the Montney over the course of this year? I know that there is a spacing test going on in 2018 what's the timing around that? And maybe just general thoughts on what you're looking at in the Montney [indiscernible] this year?","Ryan Lance","Right, okay, there is a lot of work going on there in '18 to '19 that I would characterize as appraisal work. The problem with these Montney wells is they are so great that if you want to do a spacing and stacking test where you have a handful of wells you got to build quite a bit infrastructure just to handle all the production that comes gushing out. So, to do a single pad spacing and stacking test which is where we're headed we have to -- we have got to build a gas plant, we have got to build a crude condensate processing plant, we got to build a water treatment plant and it's about 35,000 barrels a day worth of capacity on OEB basis, so about 110 million a day gas plant that kind of thing just to be able to hand the production from our appraisal testing. So that's really what we are focused on. We will start construction of those facilities this year and finish the construction next year. And so that will get us into the next round of really solid data on Montney too that will guide our development work, so there will be more to come on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","I was wondering with APLNG in distribution, with where oil prices are, can you just talk through the process you and your partners are going to go through to decide if and when the timing is appropriate in 2018?","Ryan Lance","Sure, I can take that. I think we mentioned last quarter that APLNG at that time was continuing to build cash balances and they did through their quarter -- no distributions were made during the fourth quarter. But I would say that at current prices APLNG is in a position where they will consider distributions from the company and we would expect that prices whole where they are that we would have regular dividends through the year.","Scott Hanold","And when would we get better visibility on the timing of that? Is it the next quarter call or is this more of a back half of the year type of event?","Ryan Lance","I think we'll be prepared to discuss any action that's been taken at the next quarterly call.","Scott Hanold","Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up question. Obviously, you guys are pretty well positioned, especially if these oil prices hold firm, to have a lot of extra free cash flow this year. And it is a prior year priority obviously to invest organically at some point in time. And could your discus if say, circa $60 oil prices are here to say this year. Where would be that first lever as you look to add some organic activity?","Ryan Lance","Well, Scott, we're staying on our plan. So, you can think about that at least on a capital investment side independent of what happens this year on prices. We set our scope and we're executing that scope this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","I was wondering, can we follow-up a little bit on the Barossa field development in Australia, just kind of where that is? There has been some chattering in the press about how that may move forward more aggressively here in '18 and whether or not that is accurate or how you're looking at it?","Al Hirshberg","I think, I talked in the last call about the impressive results we got from the latest appraisal at Barossa and the progress we've been making. We're -- we've been in the marketplace, talking to the key contractors, getting ready to enter feed, front end engineering design on the project. And so, I expect by the time, we get to this, next -- to our next call that we will be -- we will have entered or we will be very close to it, so we're getting close to that point. And then of course we'll have to make our way through to the feed process. But it's continued to move on track on schedule.","Roger Read","And then the unrelated kind of follow-up, lot of talk about, how to keep your OpEx on a per unit basis flat. Let's maybe leave Libya out of it. I'm just sort of curious, it's not like everybody hasn't been focused on costs the last couple of years. What are the sort of identifiable let's say efficiencies or cost savings that you can pull out over the coming quarters and maybe next couple of years?","Al Hirshberg","Yes. What we have in every one of our business units and regions doing is they've each got these kind of challenge processes going, they have got different names for them in each of the different countries. But it's really a ground up process where, we have an organized way of people suggesting ways to save money and sometimes that is our $20 million ideas and sometimes, they're $20,000 ideas. And we've been scooping them all up, and it's a very ground-up organic process. Data analytics has been a powerful course and helped us drive down our costs. And so, it's -- there is not someone silver bullet thing that's driven our costs down. It's been thousands of small things adding up and we're continuing to track, you might have thought that it would have been a low hanging fruit kind of process and there was some of that. But we found that really, we built as soon as a sustainable process now in our operating units going forward. So that's the tool that we are using to continue to offset the upward pressures.","Ryan Lance","In addition to the hard work of lowering costs that Al just referred to, we also kind of going back to the analyst day when we talked about cash margin expansion of 5% annually over the next three years, we noted that the single largest contributor to that was really the investments that we are making and where we are making them in places like Eagle Ford where the lifting costs are ultra-low. And so, the investments that we are making this year over the next three years are going into areas that are extremely accretive to our corporate unit cost. And so, there's also that investment effect as well.","Operator","Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Herrlin","Two for Al. Do you expect on this new shell acreage in the U.S. to clear it up this year completely?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, I think so. I mean I think it's a fairly near-term sort of process. So, I think that's right this year.","John Herrlin","Next one, could you give the percentage -- I know you don't have your supplemental disclosures out but what was the percentage of your proven reserves that were put as a percentage of total?","Al Hirshberg","Yes, we will have to follow up with you on that to give you those detailed numbers.","Operator","And our last question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Al just been listening to you put your analyst hat on and you made me realize you would be quite a sell side analyst, trust me you [indiscernible] corporate side though.","Al Hirshberg","It's always good to have a backup plan.","Blake Fernandez","I wanted to ask a couple of Don if I could. Just on the DD&A based on our numbers that's going to add just under $1 a share to EPS and I guess I was surprised with the magnitude. I think we had $7 billion post asset sales previously, so it seems to us like the whole move I guess would have just been reserve revisions. Could you just elaborate on that?","Donald Wallette","No. That's really is, it's the improvement in the reserves primarily in the Lower 48.","Blake Fernandez","And then on the deferred tax I just wanted to confirm the revaluation, the negative $900 million or so it seems like that's fully aligned with basically the revaluation you took on U.S. tax reform. So, I just wanted to confirm going forward like that's a onetime event going forward do you expect that to be either flatter or positive is that the right way to think about that?","Donald Wallette","Yes, the tax reform and the deferred tax revaluation was a onetime event, I would say onetime but the SEC has given companies the ability to make adjustments to those provisional numbers because they realized the amount of work it takes to revalue company's assets and liabilities, so there might be minor tweaks as we go through the year but that's not really the point. So, if you strip that effect out of the fourth quarter then you would say deferred tax I believe a source of maybe $50 million in round terms slight sources so is basically balanced and kind of a wash.","Blake Fernandez","Okay.","Donald Wallette","So, we would expect that to -- that's about where we would expect it to be.","Blake Fernandez","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications for closing remarks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Christine, and thanks to all of our listeners.

My name is Sanera, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, Sanera. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today\u2019s prepared remarks will be delivered by Don Wallette, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, our three regions President\u2019s are on the call today. They are Bill Bullock, our President of our Asia Pacific, Middle East region; Michael Hatfield, our President of the Alaska, Canada and Europe regions; and Dominic Macklon, President of our Lower 48 region.","Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation deck shows our cautionary statement. We'll make some forward-looking statements on today's call that refer to estimates or plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide and in our periodic filings with the SEC. We'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures this morning and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don.","Donald Wallette","Thanks, Ellen. Good morning to all. I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance, we realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in the quarter didn't fully translate to the bottom line as sales lagged production with inventories building by roughly 25,000 barrels a day, which represents about $0.03 a share.","We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations resulting in free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $3 billion year-to-date. This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation across a broad range of prices underscoring our commitment to capital discipline.","And importantly, over this seven quarter timeframe, cash from operations has more than covered all capital, dividends, and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. In our strong financial returns continued on a trailing 12-month basis our return on capital employed was 12.4%.","Moving to the middle column, operationally, in the quarter we produced 1.29 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% on an underlying per debt adjusted share basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, seasonal turnaround impacts for a mitigated by growth from the Lower 48 Big 3.","Touching on the final bullet in the operational column, in the second quarter we closed several small bolt-on transactions in the Lower 48 Big 3 for about a $100 million. We consistently monitor the market for these kinds of low costs with supply additions in\/and around our core areas and we were able to complete a few royalty interest and acreage deals this quarter and attractive terms.","Shifting to the far right strategic column, we've increased this year's planned share repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.25 billion of shares. We expect to purchase 1.5 billion of shares in the second half of the year.","Combined with our second quarter dividend, we returned 47% of cash from operations to shareholders in the quarter, so returning capital to shareholders remains a priority. In the second quarter, we realized 600 million in disposition proceeds and the UK disposition continues to progress toward closing in the second half of the year. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $2 billion before tax and after tax when the sale closes.","Also at closing, we'll see a significant balance sheet improvement with net cash proceeds expected to be about $2 billion, while liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations will decrease by about $2 billion.","If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at cash flows. During the quarter, we began the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $3.4 billion, which included roughly $320 million in APLNG distributions, and about $90 million collected through the ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. To-date, we've received $665 million related to the $2 billion settlement.","I'll also mention that we continued to receive contingent value payments from Cenovus during the quarter. To-date, we've received or accrued a little over $180 million in contingency payments from this 2017 transaction.","Moving on, working capital was a $600 million use of cash during the quarter. We recognized $600 million in proceeds from dispositions and we had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which was exactly half of cash from operations, excluding working capital, leaving $1.7 billion of free cash flow. For the first half, free cash flow was $3 billion, representing a 9% free cash flow yield on an annualized basis.","Looking to the last two bricks on the right, the roughly $350 million in dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases represented a return of capital to shareholders of $1.6 billion or 47% of CFO.","Total shareholder yield based on planned buybacks and our current dividend is running a little over 7%. And you see the ending cash on the far right with a slight build from the first quarter, despite choosing to increase buybacks in the quarter by $500 million compared to recent quarters.","So to briefly recap, this past quarter builds on our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. The quarter reemphasizes our commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation, and returning cash from operations to shareholders. We believe this is a sustainable and compelling value proposition for our industry.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Fox","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of a year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we highlighted at the end of last year.","Starting in Alaska, we wrapped up our winter appraisal season in the Greater Willow Area and Narwhal in the second quarter. June the first half of the year, we build seven successful appraisal wells and conducted the series of horizontal production well, injectivity and interference test. The results have also been encouraging for both Willow and Narwhal trends.","Based on these positive results, we're also taking the opportunity to drill an additional unbudgeted horizontal well from an existing Alpine Drill Site into the Narwhal trend later this year.","Also in the second quarter, we announced the high value bolt-on to our Alaska position. We acquired discovered resource acreage called Nuna, directly adjacent to our Kuparuk field and we expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Finally in June, planned maintenance was completed at Prudhoe Bay and turnarounds will continue in the third quarter of Prudhoe, the Western North Slope and Kuparuk.","Moving to Canada. We safely completed the first turnaround of our Surmont 2 central processing facility, which in addition to the maintenance scope also paved way for the alternative diluent project. This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we require, but provide diluent flexibility and improve our netbacks. We expect to have a fully operational by the end of the year as planned.","In June, Surmont was brought back online, but continues to be subject to mandatory curtailment, impacting planned production by about 5,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year. In Montney, we continue completion activities on the 14 well pad and construction of the associated infrastructure with startup still on track for the fourth quarter.","In the Lower 48, Big 3 second quarter production by assets was Eagle Ford at 221,000 barrels equivalent per day, Bakken at 98, and Delaware of 48. This represents a 41,000 barrel a day increase from the first quarter to 367,000 due to strong execution performance and improved operational efficiency. But now we expect Big 3 production in 2019 to average 360,000 barrels a day, up from our initial expectation of 350,000. This represents the growth rate of about 21% from 2018 to 2019 and an increase of over 60,000 barrels a day for the year.","As Don mentioned, during the quarter, we made several royalty interest and acreage acquisitions across the Big 3. Lastly, we continue to evaluate our results in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play. So far, although we drilled oil from the first three wells that produced a higher water cuts and we were hoping to see. So the results to date are disappointing. Louisiana Austin Chalk is the primary target, we're also evaluating opportunities and other formations within the acreage.","Moving over to Europe. As Don said, the UK disposition continues to progress towards closing. We also began a planned turnaround in the J-Area that was completed in July. ","In Norway, we completed the Greater Ekofisk area turnaround during the second quarter and sanctioned the Tor 2 fuel redevelopment project. This is the subsea production system tied back to Ekofisk that we expect to come on at the end of 2020. In the third quarter, there will be more turnaround activity in Norway at our partner operated assets. In Qatar, we remain very interested in participating in the North Field Expansion Project.","Moving to Malaysia, production ramp up at KBB continued and flew through the Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline recommenced, but we don't expect full ramp up in production to be achieved until late in the year. Also in the quarter, KBB began delivering gas to third-party floating LNG facility. This will serve as a supplementary offtake to help mitigate potential production disruptions through the pipeline.","Finally, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced earlier this month, the ConocoPhillips has been awarded a 20-year extension of our participation in the Corridor Block beyond the current contract expiring in December of 2023. So another quarter of strong execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio.","So now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we progress through 2019, we're continuing our disciplined capital approach and we're also making decisions to optimize the value of our high margin assets. We are adjusting our full-year operating plan capital guidance from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, excluding acquisitions for two unbudgeted activities.","In Alaska, we\u2019ll spend about half of incremental capital to conduct additional scope in our appraisal program, including a long-term test at the Putu horizontal appraisal well and the additional Narwhal appraisal well I mentioned earlier, as well as additional long lead items for the 2020 exploration and appraisal season.","In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve just started a rig in order to optimize rig count as we ramp towards the plateau phase of our development plans over the next few years. And we'll describe the basis of this optimization in more detail in November. Incremental rate associated with this rig won't show up until 2020.","Our 2019 operating capital guidance excludes acquisitions. To date, we have closed and announced both $300 million of transactions, including the Lower 48 [indiscernible] deals we've already mentioned and a low-cost entry into the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina. These all represent opportunistic low-cost of supply additions to our resource base.","On the production side, we expect the third quarter to average between 1.29 million and 1.33 million barrels equivalent per day. You'll notice on the right side of this chart that we're narrowing the range and our full-year outlook because half the year is behind us now, but maintaining the midpoint in our previous guidance of 1.325 million barrels a day.","Now this might look conservative considering our very strong first half performance. However, at this time we are not adjusting our full-year and midpoint guidance for two reasons. The first is because we accelerate through production versus our plan from the second half of the year into the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter and especially in the Lower 48 Big 3.","As I said earlier, we expect the Big 3 overall growth rate to be higher than planned for 2019. We expect production levels for the remainder of the year to be flat, so mostly growing \u2013 to modestly growing level from the increased rate we saw in the second quarter.","The second factor is lower-than-expected performance in two areas. Surmont, due to the mandated curtailments that we know expect to continue through the year and Alaska, where one of the four production wells of the GMT1 project is performing below expectations. The increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 in the first half of the year essentially helps offset these factors through the year. That's another great example of the value of diversification in our portfolio.","We have a busy second half of the year with several turnarounds and the ramp up of KBB production, so we don't think it's prudent to change full-year guidance at this time. But to be clear, the original $6.1 billion operating plan capital is still delivering our planned 5% underlying production growth and with our planned buybacks, we expect to deliver 8% per debt-adjusted share growth. Also bear in mind that we are carrying the UK and all of these numbers. ","We will update production and other relevant guidance items at the close of the UK disposition. Finally, we are looking forward to your Analyst and Investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined capital plan that delivers free cash flow and strong shareholder returns across a range of prices, and we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. ","Our strong performance in the first half of the year highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the second half of our 2019 plan and sharing our long-term plans with you in November. ","Now I\u2019ll open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, team and congrats on a good quarter here. I guess the first question is, you had really strong cash flow generation, part of it was led by the dividend payment out of APLNG and then the ability to pull cash from Venezuela. Can you talk about both of those line items? They're independently difficult to model the sizing and timing, and how we should think about that going forward?","Donald Wallette","Neil, this is Don. I'll take that one. So yes, cash flow was strong and you point to a couple of the items that helped that. We did have strong distributions from APLNG 320 in the quarter. And in the first quarter, I think it was $73 million. So for the first half, about $400 million. I think previously, maybe it was in the last call, maybe it was in the fourth quarter call, I gave guidance to expect APLNG distributions of about $550 million to $600 million for the year. I need to probably bump that up a little bit, but I wouldn't take two times the 400. It won't be quite that high. But I think the new expectation on distributions for 2019, I would say is going to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million.","Now I\u2019ve cautioned folks on this before, but I'll just do it again, is that, these aren't readable across the quarters. The odd quarters, the first and the third quarter always going to be low because that's when financing payments and tax payments come up, and the even quarters, the second and fourth, they're going to be relatively high. So as you're thinking quarter-to-quarter, you should expect third quarter to be kind of lowish and fourth quarter to be highish.","With respect to PDVSA, I think that's a very difficult one to give you guidance on for modeling because, we don't build that into our cash forecast either. We only recognize the earnings and the cash as we receive it. And I think that's probably the appropriate way to view it considering the situation and the counterparty.","Neil Mehta","That's, that's helpful. And then look, it's a small adjustment on CapEx from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, but certainly received some attention this morning. So can you just talk a little bit about, give us a little more about what drove the $200 million and when you think about the incremental rig in the Eagle Ford and the incremental spend in Alaska, why those are good incremental rate of return projects that that helped to lower the cost of the company?","Donald Wallette","Yes, I'll take that. So the Alaska, so we've completed the off-ice appraisals season in Alaska this winter. And the results we've seen though to Willow and Narwhal are both very encouraging, so we're really taking the opportunity to extend some of the appraisal from offerings from our existing drill sites Alpine.","And for example, we've decided to do an extended well test on a horizontal appraisal where we drill into the Narwhal trend. The results of that well are very encouraging and we thought let's see if we can go a long-term test and understand the long-term deliverability. So that's part of the increase.","We also can drill and offset injection well to this from the same drill site. So we're going to take the opportunity to do that as well. And that will get us further information on the Narwhal trend. But it's really driven by encouragement and what we saw in the initial well in the Narwhal, the fit to appraisal well we call that.","And so we're feeling good about that. We're also firming up our plans for 2020, and we're going to have another quite aggressive appraisal and exploration season in 2020. This year was really focused just on an appraisal. And so there's some long lead items to do that.","So once we get to November, we'll give you some details and exactly what we've concluded from the appraisal program this year. But it's encouraging and that's what's led to, trying to accelerate some of this learning.","In the Lower 48, we're always looking to optimize the value from an unconventional programs and we've been working specifically this year and more detailed on establishing the optimum plateau rate for the unconventionals. And that that is latest to conclude that we should add or regular to overtime to the Eagle Ford.","And we're taking the opportunity to add the seventh rig this year and maybe an eighth rig next year. So that that's what's behind the \u2013 of course we don't expect the seventh rig to contribute any production till next year, but it's all part of this sort of rational approach to establishing the create class already to the unconventional plays.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Good morning everybody. ","Douglas Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Let's stay later this year, but the last call, I seem to recall Ryan talking about trying to find out away to bring investors back to the sector and I'm more than 30% of your cash flow to be now returned to shareholders. You've obviously exceeded that this quarter.","And my question really is the share price clearly continues to languish along with the rest of the sector. What are you thinking in terms of how you differentiate your cash return? I think, the expression that that march was used was how do you differentiate that on? I'm thinking specifically about the prospect of a variable distribution, particularly in times when all prices are elevated relative to what the market might think is sustainable. So the extent to which you can share any thoughts on how you manage your own? And I've got a follow-up please.","Donald Wallette","Doug, this is Don. Let me take that one. Yes, I think we are trying to distinguish ourselves with our return of capital to shareholders. You saw the figures for the second quarter and if you look at our $1.4 billion dividend and $3.5 billion of planned buybacks this year that's $4.9 billion and let's just say that you see maybe something around $12 billion of CFOs, something in that neighborhood then that's approaching this right around 40% on a return of cash, return of capital to shareholders in the year.","So we're trying to compete and with the best capital returners in the business and certainly distinguish ourselves from the other E&P companies out there. That you mentioned the variable dividends and I would just say that we're always thinking about the best ways to return capital to shareholders and so we talked with the investment community to get feedback on their thoughts.","We do think our current model of a meaningful common dividend and a significant level of writeable buybacks that really go on indefinitely is a very attractive capital return model. But we're always testing other ideas and so we'll talk more about this in some depth in November.","Douglas Leggate","Yes. Just I want to just my second question, but just a very quick follow-up comment on that. Is that the cash return is terrific as we all know, but your relative yield is where the push back comes on. So I'm just curious if they'll fight. I mean obviously you never want to put yourself back in a position with a high ordinary dividend, but the buyback is essentially the delta between what your prior dividend was and what your current dividend is?","And as a consequence you have that thought challenge I guess that your current yield is no longer competitive was companies with similar free cash flow capabilities. So just an observation I'd be curious if you want to add any follow-up as to whether that's a consideration. And I do have a very quick follow-up.","Donald Wallette","Yes, those are always considerations, Doug. So yes, we continuously think about the level of our distributions. We think about the mix of our distributions between buybacks and cash return in the form of dividends. And we also think about how best to distribute year in periods of procyclicality. So these are the things that the management team continues to challenge and ask ourselves and we are looking forward to talking more about this in November.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. My follow-up, I expect this to be a very quick one. Matt, you mentioned you're still interested in Qatar LNG I understand that things are I can have a confidential stage for the industry right now, but I'm just curious in a success case? Is that included in the sub $7 billion multi-year capital plan or would something like the potential liquidation of Cenovus BF source of alternative funding if you are successful. Now leave it there. Thanks.","Matthew Fox","That isn't not included in the sub $7 billion that average capital. The only thing we've included in there are things that we've already capture when we don't want to be presumptuous in whether or not we'll actually take a position in Qatar LNG. So and as you see if does transpire that we have a position there then we haven\u2019t ways of funding that incremental capital, but we didn't want to include until it's captured.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Hi, yes. I guess the first question here would be a follow-up for Matt. You're making the comment about trying to align the rig counts in the Big 3 with an optimal long-term production plateau. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit as to how you're thinking about the three assets today. I know Bakken spend a flattish asset for some time. Now you're adding to the Eagle Ford. So I'd be very interested if you have updated thoughts in the Eagle Ford and even if you have any again the Permian? Thanks.","Matthew Fox","Yes. We're going to gives you more on this and in November, but we see the three \u2013 the Big 3 and then quite different stages of the life cycle. Just now Bakken is essentially our plateau. Now, depending on the taming of completions and that's going to been surrender. But we would expect that to be in the 80,000 to 90,000 barrel a day range for a long time to come. But we don't really intend to have incremental growth there.","The Eagle Ford isn't and probably we characterize as late stage growth and within the next few years, we will reach plateau there. And this addition of the rig is in service of reaching the optimum plateau and holding that for the optimum duration. The Permian for us is much earlier in the life cycle, so that has a significant growth ahead of it and it will be several years before we reach plateau there. But we do still have what we regard as a pretty rigorous approach to this and this is too difficult to explain on the phone call, but it's something that we will elaborate on in November.","Phil Gresh","And just to clarify on Eagle Ford, is there a specific target you're thinking of that you could share or would you rather say that?","Matthew Fox","I think it's fair to wait to get the context for the whole thing, but it's fair to say that we're a few years yet from the plateau, so certainly it's going to plateau at a higher rate than where it's is now, but we'll share more of that in November.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And then just my follow-up is on the buyback. Don, maybe you could just maybe clarify a little bit. There's obviously a $500 million raise in the full-year, which you fully accomplished in the second quarter. So maybe just a little clarity around how you're thinking about the back half. Is it just more about kind of what happens with prices? Is there some degree of conservatism there? Or maybe intentionally stepped up in the second quarter? Just any thoughts you have about the progression you took. Thanks.","Donald Wallette","Yes. I think you can expect us to revert back to the $750 million a quarter that we've kind of historically run the last couple of years. As far as the bump up in the second quarter by $500 million, we knew we wanted to increase the buybacks for the year to 3.5. And we certainly have the cash on hand to be able to do that. And of course, we noticed a pretty significant dislocation in our share price, Brent price correlation or at least the historical correlation.","And we felt like that was selling at a large discount or intrinsic value. We felt that was a good opportunity and why not just go ahead and spend that increment during the second quarter. But the run rate, we expect to go to $750 million a quarter over the next two quarters and then we'll talk about 2020 and beyond what our plans are as far as distributions in November.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Douglas Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Donald Wallette","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Terreson","Hi. So this is probably for Don, but consensus expectations are for declining returns on capital and production growth for most E&P companies next year, which appears to be unfavorably affecting valuation than share prices in E&P. And while you guys have differentiated yourselves with credible plans to sustain higher returns and grow shareholder distributions and you've delivered for several years.","The message seems to be that lower spending in portfolio restructuring maybe the optimal way to preserve value and share prices, especially if the sector is maturing. So my question is that when you consider this theme, but also the quality of your investment opportunity set, does it change the way that you think about future capital management, especially given your historic emphasis on returns on capital and trying to increase them as well?","Donald Wallette","Well I don't think it changes our thinking. I think Doug, our strategy that we came out with in late 2016 was very much focused on capital discipline and a good balance between investing for growth and continued cash flow growth in the business as well as a high level of returns of capital back to the shareholders. So I think we've seen a good success on that strategy and it's one that we have a lot of conviction on going forward.","Douglas Terreson","Okay. Thank you, Don.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, all. The decision to increase CapEx this quarter could presumably have been avoided if you were concerned about the optics of doing that. I just wondered why you couldn\u2019t find a couple of hundred million dollars elsewhere, Matt and stick to budget. Thanks.","Matthew Fox","Yes. I mean, obviously, we did consider that, Paul, that the \u2013 but we really feel as if the scope, the original scope that we laid out for the assets was we should be delivering that and then these opportunities to sort of modestly increase the capital. We're going to be value adding on top of that.","So we didn't feel as if just to stick to the capital program for the sake of doing that without recognizing the extra value that we could add here. We didn't think that would be appropriate. So we made the decision to do. I mean, it's a 3% increase in capital. It's not that significant, but it's \u2013 we believe that the both of those in Alaska and the Eagle Ford are something that the shareholder should want us to do.","Paul Sankey","Yes. I guess that's kind of the point, which is that it's such a minor amount. It's almost just \u2013 such a minor amount, but it's a relatively minor amount. I just thought that maybe the optics would have been better if you'd managed to stick with the number. That part of the reason for saying that is simply that you will running ahead of growth while you're running strongly on growth, which again would have suggested, maybe you could actually work towards pulling back a bit on spending. Is that a fair assessment?","Donald Wallette","Yes. Yes, definitely. I mean there's certainly, we're ahead of our growth schedule for the year because with a significant outperformance in the second quarter really driven by the big three. But for the full-year, we still feel as it was prudent for us to call the same long full-year outlook, as I said in my prepared remarks. So it was quite a significant amount of acceleration and then in the second quarter numbers. So although we appear to be heading and we appeared to be ahead of it. There's no real change for the full-year.","Paul Sankey","Understood. If I could ask just a quick one that you might not want to answer and then a bigger one. Firstly, is there any timing on Qatar, best guess? And secondly, where do you go from here on disposals after North Sea? Thanks a lot.","Donald Wallette","No. We don't really have anything new to add to the timing expectations for Qatar. This is clear that the Qatar gas is making progress on developing the project, but we don't really have any additional insights that we can offer on the timing of when they select partners at this time.","In terms of dispositions, yes, we have the UK disposition to close and then that's proceeding well. We have a few smaller dispositions that are in the works around the portfolio. But if there's anything significant to report on that front, we'll do it when we have something to report.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alastair Syme","Hi, everybody. A couple of questions, in the past, I think both of you guys you had mentioned that Permian M&A doesn't really complete on a cost to supply basis versus the portfolio disinterested. If you're seeing any change in seller expectations, given the sort of the recent weakness in equity values?","And then my follow-up give it to you now, but on Corridor, the Indonesian PSC, I think you've mentioned sort of in previous discussions that, it was probably going to be quite challenging to renew. So I want to what sort of changes have happened and how does that match up on the costs of supply? Thank you. ","Donald Wallette","Okay, Alastair, I think I will take the first question and then I'll pass onto Bill for the details on the Corridor PSC extension. So you're asking do we \u2013 if we seen a change in Permian seller expectations? We're not really in that market, asking sailors what the expectations are.","And so obviously we're not seeing a change from that perspective. We still believe that there's a mismatch between, what people expect for their assets and what we can be competed as use of capital for our capital. And that may change over time. So that that's why we're focused on the sort of really relatively small, but very high value that vision to the portfolio and through acquisition that we announced over the past few months, so no significant change and expectations there. On Corridor, I think Bill?","W. L. Bullock","Sure. Hi, Alastair. It's Bill. I'm happy to discuss the Corridor extension. We were really pleased with the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources announced that we'd been awarded a 20 year PSC for the Corridor Block and that we're going to be continuing our 45-year presence in Indonesia. That PSC is going to begin on December 2023 that's immediately following the expiry of existing PSC. We'll have a 46% working interest that's prior to a 10% dilution for local governments that's required by the government regulations.","It is a new growth split PSC, term PSC and it's got a signature bonus of $115 million net to ConocoPhillips. And we expect we'd make that payment upon completion and definitive documentation. You also see that it's got a commitment of about a $100 million net framework commitment, but that's during the first five years a new PSC. So it really doesn't start until 2024. It is a robust low cost supply extension and we're pleased that we've been granted that.","Alastair Syme","Okay. Can I ask will be entitlement \u2013 net-net will be entitlement production be lower going forward versus what you have today?","W. L. Bullock","Sure. Then the production will be a bit lower. Obviously the working interest is down about 13% and then it's on gross split terms.","Alastair Syme","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys, good afternoon. Two question, one, maybe I think both of them should be met. In Permian, when \u2013 do you think that now, yes, the time or that do you have a time line when you would become more aggressive in pushing the activities there? And second that I think you make some comment about Austin Chalk. So is that at this point, based on what you see, we should significantly down scale the potential over their or the opportunities there?","Matthew Fox","Okay. Thanks Paul. Good to have you back on the call. We will be over time increasing our activity in the Permian as we move from the mode that we're in just now, which is essentially making sure that we're optimizing the well spacing and stacking and the order of which we tackle the various zones they exist within our Permian acreage. Once we've got that completely then we'll increase to more sustainable rig count there to build towards plateau.","And we are going to talk in more detail about that in November for sure. So that you can understand the question, but we want if you that in the context of this overall work on optimizing the plateau. So more to come on that, but yes, you\u2019re asking what we ultimately become more aggressive and our prepared development of our Permian resource position? Yes, we will.","Paul Cheng","I'm sorry, Matt. That means that, that\u2019s not next year or that maybe it\u2019s more like in the 2021 or 2022 before you become more aggressive on the manufacturing?","Matthew Fox","Yes, it will be a few years out before we get to the rig count that will ultimately take the plateau.","Paul Cheng","Okay.","Matthew Fox","On the Austin Chalk, yes, we've tested three of the four wells that we had to test the Austin Chalk play there. And it's just as we brought those wells on the petroleum system isn't working as effectively as we hoped it would. The chalk hasn\u2019t dewatered to the extent that they are \u2013 this required to get high enough production rates. I mean unconventional wells produce higher water cuts and other plays, I mean the Delaware Basin for example.","So that by itself is not a disqualifier. But here the water cut that we've seen it\u2019s been a bet over 90%. The oil rates have been about a 100 barrels a day. It's just unlikely to be enough to justify a development and that part of the play. There are targets in the Wilcox and there are targets and the Tuscaloosa Marine shale. So the acreage is not condemned by that primary target and the Austin Chalk doesn't look encouraging just now.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Can I just sneak in a final real quick one? On the Eagle Ford for the second half of the year. So yes, your target is just being conservative that you are slowing down their activity from the second quarter level?.","Dominic Macklon","Hey, Paul. It\u2019s Dominic here. I think basically what we've seen on Eagle Ford this year as an acceleration of wells online into the second quarter. So if I look at the total wells online count we expect this year, it's the same. So the character of the growth profile is basically being an acceleration of the ramp and then relatively flat for Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Brackett","Thanks. A question on Alaska. I'm kind of curious around the timing of development or sort of pre-FID developments. Mentally we'd sort of thought about Willow being 2021 FID and then maybe Norwell and West Willow. Does that still make sense and where does Nuna fit into that development pipeline?","Michael Hatfield","Yes. Hi Bob. This is Michael Hatfield. Thanks for the questions. You're right. As far as the timing of Willow with the results that Matt was talking about from an exploration and appraisal perspective, we're very encouraged by that. We're actually sizing facilities now and expect to get to FID here in 2021. We do see first oil from Willow probably in the 2025, 2026 timeframe. Its roundabout the time that we had talked with you all about when you\u2019re up in Alaska last year.","At Nuna, just to provide a little bit of color on that, it's a discovered resource on 21,000 acres that's in our backyard. It's immediately adjacent to Cathartic. It's very low-cost of supply in the low-30s. It's $100 million that for 100 million barrels. It's something we're very pleased about. It'll be developed from pads, both that exist at Cathartic and a pad at Nuna where there's already gravel and a road to that pad in place.","The remaining facilities at Nuna can be built in a single ice road season. So we'll have appraisal over the next couple of years and target first oil in the 2022 timeframe. The development, we'll be using existing drilling and completion technology and then the development itself will be incorporated as part of our Cathartic program, so it won't be incremental to that. So we're very excited about this low-cost of supply bolt-on acquisition.","Robert Brackett","Great. Thanks. And then what about the 2020 exploration program? What's the focus?","Michael Hatfield","Yes, we're actually putting the plans together for that now. We're going to be drilling in Willow and the primary focus is on understanding the extent of Willow so that we can fully size the facilities. We're also going to be drilling a prospect to the Southwest, called Harpoon. We'll drill several wells in Harpoon. At least that's the current plans. We'll talk to you more about that in November.","Robert Brackett","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Devin McDermott","Good morning. So my first question, I wanted to ask about some of the opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and specifically on Argentina. Just the opportunity set that you see there are longer term and how that fits into the strategy and perhaps from a cost of supply or return standpoint, how it competes with other shale on your portfolio?","Michael Hatfield","Yes. I'll take that Dave. And this is Matt. Yes, so we've picked up this about 25,000-acre position in the Vaca Muerta. The shale is very like the Eagle Ford, but it has some characteristics of the Permian and there are multiple stack piece within there. It\u2019s in the oil lag and it looks to be in a very good geography. There could be north of five layers within the play across this acreage.","Our expectations on a success with success pieces here would be certainly north of 0.5 billion barrels of potential on the acreage we've picked up. So we see the Vaca Muerta as probably the best international play, the best unconventional play outside North. America. And this represented a really good low cost of supply entry into the basin for us.","There aren't any significant work commitments that are work commitments, but they're not significant and we'll be able to manage them within our exploration budget over the next several years.","Devin McDermott","Got it. That's helpful. And my second question is on Alaska. You mentioned in the prepared remarks some issues at one of the wells on the GMT develop. I just wondering if you could quantify the impact a bit more, what you're seeing there and then talk about whether there's an opportunity to remediate that or offset that either later this year or maybe a down the road in 2020 or beyond?","Michael Hatfield","Yes, Devin, this is Michael. We've had underperformance at GMT 1. The development was brought online last year and ramped up to the plateau rate. It's a smaller development there's only four producers that are in this development. So any one producer that underperforms ends up significantly impacting the overall development. And that's been the case here.","I should mention that despite this underperformance, with the capital reductions that we had while we were executing the project, we actually deliver the project for what we had expected in terms of costs of supply. We don't see remediating this at this point, but we are continuing with our GMT 2 plans where we've taken the learnings from GMT 1 and applied those to this different reservoir at GMT 2.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold","Yes. Thanks on Canada, Matt, you talked about obviously using the alternative diluent and it was going to improve the netbacks going forward? Can you kind of quantify what that means in terms of how much incremental income or revenue you'll see from that?","Michael Hatfield","This is Michael, again. With the diluent project we would \u2013 so it'll depend on the season. But in general as we think about a year-on-year improvement, it would be say $1 to $2 a barrel or so. When we look at the total improvement from a blend ratio perspective, we'll be reducing about \u2013 actually improving about 35% from a total blend perspective and that's upward of a couple of dollars a barrel.","Matthew Fox","One of the big advantages there, Scott, is the flexibility because as Michael was saying it could be $1 or $2? Could be quite a bit more than that sometimes because the market moves, the price of condensate versus the price with some fair takes the value of the double bit versus the value of a synbit. And we have the flexibility here to run all synthetic, all condensate, some blend of the two and we can batch it as well. So this will be perhaps the only plant that the \u2013 with a truly active optionality and the what we choose to blend with the veterinarian and that's going to unlock a lot of value over time.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Thanks. That's great color. And then one really quick one. I think last quarter, you talked about having some excess gas firm in the Permian region. Were you all able to take advantage of some of the weak pricing and be able to monetize that this quarter? And can you give us a sense of like how much capacity you've got there and any kind of terms you have out there?","Donald Wallette","Yes, Scott. This is Don. Yes, some of the things you're asking are fairly commercially, so probably can't give you a whole lot on that. I would just maybe say that our offtake out of the Permian is multiples of what our equity production requires.","And yes, we continued to be able to take advantage commercially of the low Waha prices. I think they averaged in the second quarter minus $0.01. And so we do purchase in the Permian. We take it to a points west and capture a margin on that.","Second quarter was probably wasn't quite is active for us is the first quarter. But that's going to continue until some of the new pipelines like Gulf Coast Express and others come on later this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. One more following up on the previous one regarding the gas situation, what's the latest that you're seeing as it relates to flaring, particularly in the Permian given some of the capacity constraints?","Dominic Macklon","Well, yes, so this is \u2013 Dominic here. Thanks for the question. I think in terms of our own situation, we don't have a particular problem because we have very good offtake as Don just talked about. I think there's really a question of when this new gas export capacity is going to come on and we see that as Don said, there's some significant pipelines coming on the end of this year and we see quite a lot coming thereafter. So I think this is something that is going to get resolved in pretty short order.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And I'm sorry if you addressed this earlier, but income tax in Q2, 22%, the lowest, I think in about eight quarters. Were there any special moving parts that explain why it was so low?","Donald Wallette","Yes. Pavel, this is Don. Yes. Our reported effective tax rate was 22% during the quarter. So we did have a number of special items. And so we provide in our supplemental information, our reported ATRs as well as our adjusted \u2013 and so I think you saw our adjusted ATRs was about 40%, which is typically where we are or would expect to be.","So the difference between those two are going to be the special items where we either pay no tax on those items or we're paying very low tax. And so those get \u2013 that's what drives down the reported ATR. So in the quarter for example, we had a pretty large tax benefit associated with our UK sale and of course being a tax benefit, it has no tax on it. So that's a zero tax rate.","We had something similar on the sunrise disposition. And then you look at the earnings that we get from our equity affiliates, now the taxes on equity affiliates are paid at the equity affiliate level. So that it won't get reported in our corporate level. So those earnings are effectively zero from effective tax rate standpoint. So in the quarter we had a large number of special items with that either no tax or low tax type treatment.","Ellen DeSanctis","Sanera, this is Ellen. It sounds like we're out of questions. ","Operator","Correct. We have no further questions at this time.","Ellen DeSanctis","Okay everybody. Well, thank you very much for joining us today and by all means, if you have any follow-up questions after the call, feel free to reach out to us.

Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning. I'll start on slide four with our key strategic financial and operational highlights for the third quarter. Starting on the left side of the chart with strategy, this quarter was another impactful one for our company. We've executed a number of transformational decisions to accelerate our differentiated, disciplined and returns-focused strategy.","During the quarter, we closed the sales of our San Juan basin and Panhandle assets. We also continued progressing several other sales that should close in the fourth quarter or early next year. We expect to deliver greater than $16 billion of asset sales during 2017.","In the third quarter, we paid down another $2.4 billion of debt, bringing our balance sheet debt to $21 billion. In the quarter, we received a credit rating upgrade and we are on track for the year-end debt balance to be under our target of $20 billion.","We repurchased $1 billion of our shares during the quarter, which takes us to over $2 billion repurchased for the year, representing about a 3.5% reduction in outstanding shares year to date. We expect to buy back another $1 billion of shares in the fourth quarter. Between our dividend and the expected share buybacks, capital returned to shareholders would represent the equivalent of 60% to 70% of our operating cash flow in 2017.","Moving to the middle column, our third quarter financial results extended the momentum we've built over the past year to achieve profitability and maintain cash flow neutrality in a $50 price environment.","On an adjusted earnings basis, we were profitable for the second successive quarter, realizing a profit of about $200 million, or $0.16 a share. We generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations excluding working capital.","I want to point out that operating cash flows this quarter were impacted by a choice we made to use a portion of our cash balances to accelerate funding of future pension obligations with a $600 million cash infusion. I'll cover this item in more detail in a few slides. Excluding the pension item, cash flow was right in line with our expectations and consistent with our published sensitivities.","On a year-to-date basis, cash from operations is $4.5 billion, which exceeds CapEx and dividends by over $400 million despite the $600 million CFO reduction I just mentioned. As we've shown for more than a year now, our cash flows have more than covered our CapEx and dividends. We don't require a pathway or market help to get to cash neutrality. Adjusted operating costs were 15% lower year on year, as we continue to lower our breakeven price across the portfolio.","Moving to our operational results on the right. We're meeting or exceeding all of our operational targets. Production excluding Libya for the quarter was 1.2 million BOE a day. Adjusting for dispositions, our underlying production on a per-debt adjusted share basis grew by 19% compared to the third quarter of last year. We successfully completed the last lenders' test at APLNG, which allowed us to release the final project financing loan guarantee. And we continue to execute our 2017 capital program scope at lower costs. As Al will cover in more detail, we're lowering our capital guidance for the year to $4.5 billion. That's a reduction of $500 million or 10% compared to our initial 2017 guidance.","So to recap, this quarter's performance again reinforces the transformation we've made as a company. We're delivering on our priorities and continuing to build momentum. And while the outlook for commodity prices has improved recently, we remain committed to our disciplined, returns-focused strategy that creates shareholder value.","If you turn to slide five, I'll walk through the third quarter financial results. With WTI averaging about $48 a barrel and Henry Hub about $3 an MCF, our average realized price was around $39 per BOE. Compared to the prior quarter, adjusted earnings improved slightly because of higher realizations and equity earnings, partly offset by disposition impacts.","Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted earnings improved by over $1 billion, with the improvement driven by higher commodity prices, lower depreciation and exploration expenses and the impact of dispositions. Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown on the lower right. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.","If you turn to slide six, I'll cover our cash flows during the quarter. First, looking at the sources of cash shown in green, cash from operations was $1.1 billion, which as I mentioned, was impacted by our decision make a $600 million cash contribution to our U.S. pension fund. As we continue to strengthen our financial position, we look across the balance sheet for opportunities to reduce long-term obligations. This payment represents an economic acceleration of future contributions which will also serve to reduce cash flow volatility and increase flexibility going forward.","The other major source of cash during the quarter was asset sales, which generated $3 billion. The uses of cash, shown in red, were in line with expectations we provided during our last earnings call. We used $2.5 billion to retire debt and distributed $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments.","If you turn to slide seven, I'll wrap up by covering year-to-date cash flows to emphasize our focus on free cash flow generation. This slide illustrates the disciplined approach we take to running the company. Starting with the first set of bars on the left, as I just said, year-to-date operating cash flows have more than exceeded spending on capital investments and dividend distributions. The second set of bars shows how cash proceeds from dispositions, our pre-funding our debt reduction and share repurchases. In addition to the roughly $14 billion of cash proceeds shown here, we also have $2 billion of equity in Cenovus, which will be converted to cash proceeds over time.","So in summary, the business continues to run well. Now let me turn it over to Al to give you some color on the operations.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year, including our updated capital guidance. Operationally, we had another strong quarter, despite some tough weather challenges here in Texas. As Don mentioned, production excluding Libya averaged 1.2 million barrels per day. Despite a 15,000 barrel per day reduction in the quarter due to Hurricane Harvey, better performance from our global portfolio allowed us to offset this loss and still exceed the midpoint of guidance by 12,000 barrels per day. Year on year, this represents an increase in underlying production of 1.4%.","During the quarter, we ran 12 operated rigs in the Lower 48 Big Three unconventional assets, six in the Eagle Ford, four in the Bakken and two in the Delaware Basin. Our Big Three unconventional production was 211,000 barrels per day with 123,000 per day from Eagle Ford, 66,000 per day from the Bakken and 22,000 per day from the Delaware. This was about flat to the second quarter of 2017 but included the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Excluding this impact, production from the Big Three unconventionals would have been about 6% higher sequentially.","In Canada, Surmont achieved a record daily production of 141,000 barrels a day gross during the quarter. The project continues to ramp up toward full capacity.","In Australia, APLNG ran at 110% of nameplate and demonstrated 98% uptime. We've shipped 92 cargos through the end of the third quarter.","In Alaska and Europe, we safely executed significant turnaround activities which now completes our major turnarounds for 2017.","And finally, across the portfolio, we're making great progress on our conventional projects. In Alaska, we spud the first wells at 1H NEWS with first oil expected before year-end. Meanwhile, GMT1 is still on track for first oil by the end of 2018 with costs running well under budget.","The Aasta Hansteen topsides left port in South Korea headed for Norway and this project is also on track for first production by late 2018. Work also continues on Clair Ridge and Bohai phase 3, both of which are on track for first production in 2018.","Now, moving on to slide 10, I'll provide an update on our 2017 outlook. We're lowering our full year 2017 capital guidance for the second time this year. We now expect to spend $4.5 billion. We continue to do more for less. The updated capital guidance represents a 10% reduction from our original budget. Despite this CapEx reduction, we expect to exceed our original production guidance. This year, we now expect to deliver 3% underlying production growth, and that's 17% on a debt-adjusted share basis.","On the left side of the slide, we list key fourth quarter and full year guidance metrics. Below the capital, you can see our fourth quarter production guidance is 1.195 million to 1.235 million barrels per day, and we've tightened the previous full year production range to between 1.350 million and 1.360 million barrels per day. Our remaining drivers are tracking closely with our guidance.","So that's a quick recap of the quarter. As Don said, business is running well. We continue to look forward to providing an update of our future plans at our analyst and investor meeting on November 8.","So I'll turn the call over now to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, hi. Good morning, everybody. Excuse me, I needed to clear my throat. Hi, everyone. So I'm not optimistic on getting too many forward-looking questions answered today, but I'm -","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Come on.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I may give it a go so just one forward-looking and one about the quarter, if I may. $55 Brent all the way out in the strip from what we can tell now. You guys are obviously fairly levered to that. So it kind of changes the narrative a little bit about where your cash breakeven is for the portfolio and your choice between sustaining the buyback program perhaps beyond the disposal proceeds that you brought in versus reinvesting in the company. So I know you're going to get into this in a couple weeks, can you just frame for us what a $55 world, what does Conoco think about by way of growth versus continued debt-adjusted per share growth?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well that, Doug, that almost sounds like you've written the title of one of our slides for the week after next for our Analyst Meeting, so I think you've teed it up perfectly. And we're going answer it then, as you predicted.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, I'd thought I'd give it a go, but anyway, it sounds optimistic. So thank you for that. My quarterly question is really a real simple one. The U.S. is exporting this week again close to 2 million barrels a day of oil. It seems to us that we're now starting to see some real linkage, I guess, between certain parts of the Lower 48 and Brent pricing, so more of a Brent minus than a WTI plus kind of number. So I'm just curious, is that what you're seeing? Do you think it's sustainable, and if so, maybe you could help us with how you think that would impact the relative investment decisions for the Eagle Ford as we go forward? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yes, Doug, this is Don. I can comment a little bit on that. When you look at our U.S. production in total, we're pretty heavily weighted towards the Brent side and not so much exposed to WTI, and a large part of that is because our Alaska North Slope, which is the largest portion of our U.S. really trades similar to Brent.","Probably what's not recognized well enough is our Eagle Ford production that you alluded to, about half of that production is marketed on an LLS component basis and as you know, LLS and Brent have had a pretty strong relationship. So we're not seeing the same impacts of the widening differentials that you might expect there. I do expect going forward that those relationships, they have maintained in the past, so I don't see why they would break down in the future.","As far as exports themselves, we've been pretty active in the export, I'd say, in the first and second quarters this year and going back to last year, but we're seeing demand pretty strong domestically now. And so I think in the third quarter, I don't believe we had any waterborne cargos going outside the country. We did have some going inland or within the country. But we're seeing markets improve here in the U.S., and as I mentioned, we're pretty exposed to Brent relative to WTI.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, Don, so if export capacity is obviously up, can you envisage 100% of the Eagle Ford being marketed on a Brent basis or no?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, I think 100% would be an awful lot. I don't know what dynamic would have to cause that. Today, and in the third quarter, we didn't see the advantage, the arbitrage advantage in exporting relative to the strength that we were seeing domestically. I think there will be times when you see \u2013 I mean, if you go back last year, we had a good bit going outside the country, and, but 100% is probably something that we wouldn't be expecting.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate the answers guys. I'll see you in a couple weeks. Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Doug.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Don, just curious that for APLNG I presume we're now in a positive cash flow position, and I believe you must be building a cash cushion in the joint venture. So if the price stays here, when do you think the partner will start to receive the cash dividend payout from that? I mean, in some way that your cash flow from operation in this quarter not only impact by the $600 million of the pension contribution but also impacted by the not distributing the cash from the APLNG. Is that correct?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, we do have, I mean you're right, Paul, we do have cash that's building up in APLNG as we've said before, the cash, the net cash flow breakeven there in fact is somewhere in the $45 to $50 Brent range. And so, yeah, we have been building cash within the joint venture. And if prices stay where they are for the rest of the year, it's quite possible that we could see a fourth quarter distribution from APLNG, and then we would expect that to correspond to prices next year as well.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. So that's an active area of discussion in the joint venture right now, Paul. And we of course want to make sure we maintain enough cash build going into next year to cover loan payments as they schedule out next year. But even with that, at these kind of prices, you're absolutely right that we're building excess cash and we'll be in a discussion about distribution timing. But no decision has been taken on that yet at this point.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And now since that I have you here, the $4.5 billion of the revised CapEx for this year, that would suggest that fourth quarter would jump to $1.4 billion. You've been doing about $1 billion a quarter. What may be the effect behind why we that see that jump by 40%?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. So we did $1.1 billion this quarter.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And also \u2013 you can also talk about that, whether $4.5 billion is really what you consider is now your new sustainable CapEx requirement.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, that latter question we'll cover in two weeks. But it was $1.1 billion this past quarter, and we're forecasting between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter to get to that $4.5 billion number. And the key drivers to that increase, we have been on a fairly steady increase through the year in the Lower 48 on overall activity, and so there is still some more build in actual CapEx spend, and that's 3Q to 4Q in the Lower 48.","And that's actually exacerbated a little bit by the Harvey effect, because there was some money that didn't get spent in the third quarter due to Harvey and just some work that you weren't doing because we were down for that for a period of time. But we also have increases quarter to quarter in Bohai Bay as that phase 3 project, as that continues to ramp. We expect that spending to be up. And also, our drilling programs in Alaska and Europe are both going to be up, we expect third quarter to fourth quarter. And so those are the key pieces.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. So first question is just on kind of a follow-up on the CapEx question. I mean, $4.5 billion of CapEx, 3% production growth, I certainly don't think anyone expected that at the beginning of this year. Al, maybe you could just provide a little color about how you feel like the company has been able to accomplish this, and then whether you think that you can continue to grow at these types of rates at this level of spend. It's obviously a choice, but how do you think about that?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. I think, Phil, we really accomplished this \u2013 I mean, you're right that we have done better than we expected, the plan we laid out for ourselves at this time last year as we were looking into 2017, and we've continued to do a really good job of driving efficiency. That's been a key part of our capital discipline. It's allowed us to lower our capital costs. We've been successful at resisting inflation to a large extent in the Lower 48, and our production performance has really come out on the high side in a number of different places, and those things have kind of added together to give that outperformance.","And as I look at it, I made some comments on the last quarterly call that as I travel around and see this outperformance and try to really understand what's driving it, as I said last quarter, I think in our organization, operationally as we've reduced the amount of money that we were spending on big projects, the growth money, the $17 billion we used to spend in this company back in 2014, our organization has been able to spend a lot more focus on the base. And our base production is really a big part of what's been outperforming, and I do expect that to continue. So without front running our story in two weeks, I think you can expect that we'll show you our latest calculations on that. But this is not a one-trick deal this year. It's going to continue, I think.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Okay. Very clear. A second question, I guess, for Don. This one would be, again, don't want to front run the Analyst Day, but some of the key tenets that you've talked about over the past several quarters has been 20% to 30% of CFO back to the shareholder and $3 billion of buybacks between 2018 and 2020. And those were not in the slides today. I just want to ensure that there is no real change to that commitment on a go-forward basis. Obviously, you're going to have a bigger update more broadly.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","No. Right, Phil. Yeah, we'll be laying all that out here in a couple weeks for you, but absolutely no backtracking from any of those commitments. So you'll see that again here in a few weeks.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. If I could ask another question on the capital spending budget, coming down quite a bit just sequentially quarter to quarter. Al, could you provide a little color on that? Are you seeing some \u2013 was that a change in your service cost expectations? Was that part related to less activity related to hurricane? And just a little bit of color on specifically what that reduction was for.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Sure. Let me talk a little more about that. I mean at a high level, it is, as I was talking about a minute ago, just reflecting our continued capital discipline, but there is this resisting inflation part. I think since a little over a quarter ago when the industry in the Lower 48 had a bit of the tapping on the brakes that people have talked about, that has really halted Lower 48 inflation in its tracks for the most part.","And so, some of our assumed inflation that we thought we would see earlier in the year in the second half, we aren't seeing. And that little bit of slowdown and reduction in rigs that we've seen and slowdown in activity has been enough to give us an absence of inflation that we had been assuming. But we also are continuing to see increases in efficiency across the Lower 48 and across the world.","We've also had, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, GMT1, one of our major projects that we have going in Alaska, has continued to really perform well on the project side and is under-spending relative to the budget, and so that's a savings. And then you mentioned Harvey. There is a little bit of Harvey delay where there's some work that we weren't doing or paying for during the time we were down for Harvey that is a little tiny piece of this reduction.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So the bulk of it, it's actually organic stuff happening, right? So that's -","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","That's right. And I should also \u2013 there's one other thing is there's we've also seen some reduction on the operated by others side. So a little less AFEs coming in from some of our partners where they're operating than we would have forecast, as they've slowed down a bit from what the plans we were expecting from them.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great color. And maybe this one's for Don. You gave some brief comments in your prepared remarks on the Cenovus ownership. Obviously the lock-up's expiring here soon. Could you provide a little more detail on big picture, kind of how you look at that ownership and what you kind of want to see as you go down the path of how and when you monetize it?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Sure, Scott, a little bit at least. The standstill, as you mentioned, that's coming up pretty soon. It expires November 17, so we'll be free to market the equity any time after that. The market value right now is right around $2 billion, I believe. This equity was really transactional currency, as you know. So we're not natural long-term owners, not strategic owners, so we'll be reducing our position over time. I think you should expect that given our financial position, we'll be patient. We can afford to be patient, and so our approach is going to be value driven.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Maybe one first on the U.S. onshore. I know you averaged 12 rigs in the quarter. What's the current rig count in the U.S. onshore? And how should we think about that trajectory into 2018?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well of course, we'll cover 2018 the week after next, but I mean, I think that certainly I can without terribly front running things say that you can expect to see from us for the Lower 48 for 2018 a very disciplined program. You're not going see anything crazy in two weeks. And you're going to see the same general kind of activity levels and we may have rigs of opportunity that we add or subtract here and there as we have certain situations, but I think we're at a pretty comfortable rig level at that kind of number that you mentioned.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on the project side, I mean you've mentioned Alaska a couple times on the ongoing projects. The Willow discovery as well as discoveries by others in the region, Alaska, have mostly kind of flown under the radar up to this point. Can you talk a little bit about what activity you may have planned in Alaska in that area over the next 12 plus months and what role it could play in either driving modest growth or maintaining volumes in the region?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, we have this pipeline of projects in Alaska, a lot of good news there on things that have been going well, everything from CD5 to GMT1 to 1H NEWS that are all going well. Just take CD5 for an example for a moment. When we took FID on CD5, we were projecting plateau volumes of 16,000 barrels a day gross and we're now at 26,000 barrels a day.","So projects like that have allowed us to continue to extend maintaining our production and we've already said that we plan to drill five exploration wells in Alaska this winter. In addition to that, three of those wells by the way are appraisal wells for Willow and two that are new wildcats along the lines of what you were hinting at there, that some of the other opportunities out to the west.","And we also have submitted permits for new seismic on those state leases that we picked up late last year. Remember, we picked up about 740,000 acres gross in December of last year and so we're starting to plan our seismic work around that. And so we see additional opportunity out to the west, but also have a nice pipeline of projects that we're working on today. And we hope to get GMT2 over the line to FID next.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Al.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. Given the upcoming Analyst Meeting, I'll ask you just a couple of modeling ones and more specific questions. First on the pension, do we consider that very much a one-off, or is that going to be a future payment? Secondly, along cash flow lines, you talked about the $4.5 billion, the potential for lower, for increased efficiencies going forward. Should we push $4.5 billion as your spending into our long-term modeling? And then I have a separate follow-up. Thanks.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Paul, this is Don.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Don.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","I'll address the pension question that you had. I think you should view this as a unique opportunity that we had to make a fairly substantial discretionary contribution to the pension fund. You see a lot of companies doing that these days for a variety of reasons. I explained our reasons, but to answer your question, our plan doesn't include significant contributions going forward next few years.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","And I guess on the CapEx, obviously we'll be talking about the forward CapEx here in a couple of weeks. Don't forget that we have been ramping through 2017 in our Lower 48 rig program and from the low levels we were at last year. And so that spending has been increasing quarter over quarter to get to the kind of levels that we're at today.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And there's been some press out on Australia, domestic gas issues. Could you talk a little bit about that? Thanks.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, we've talked about that on the last few calls where the government has been working on considering export restrictions and using this basis of making sure everybody is a net dom gas contributor, particularly out in the east. And the decision they've taken recently that you would have seen in the press is they've decided not to restrict exports in 2018.","And what facilitated that decision by the government is that the three Curtis Island operators in Queensland that all have these similar coal seam projects have agreed that we will offer to the domestic market any spot cargos that we have planned next year, we'll offer that gas to the domestic market at an equivalent net-back price before we go to spot LNG sales. And so for us, from an economic standpoint of course, that's we're indifferent to things that bring us the same net back.","There's been some noise in the press about LNG operators selling spot cargos at net backs that are less than domestic prices. And obviously, you know us well enough to know we wouldn't do that. We're not in the business of selling our gas for less than whatever the best is in the marketplace. But we have also seen just here today in the press, where we announced our latest domestic gas sales, so this is an example of where we had some gas that could've gone spot and 21 petajoules of gas that we've just agreed to sell into the domestic market that would've gone to spot LNG, because we were able to sort of achieve those net-back objectives.","So with that sale being added on, we now are north of 180 petajoules of domestic gas that APLNG will be selling into the market next year. So in 2017, APLNG is supplying about 20% of the dom gas market in eastern Australia. And next year, with this latest sale, we'll be just shy. We're already just with what we've done so far almost up to 30%.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's interesting. I don't know if this is public or not, but can you talk about how you calculate the net-back comparability?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well, I mean it's reasonably straightforward. You know what all the pieces are. The piece some people sometimes miss when they just look at sales prices is there are significant transportation costs in Australia to get from the tailgate of our \u2013 to get from where we're producing the gas to the market to our individual customers. There's significant transportation distribution costs, so that's a big. And of course, you have the same thing on LNG, where you're paying to liquefy and to ship. And so it's just getting to the equivalent net back for us all the way back to the wellhead is the way we think about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Folks, good morning. Al, I wanted to go back to the capital commentary that you provided. Last quarter, I thought it was interesting. I think you said for every $1 of inflation you were seeing in the Lower 48, you were seeing $2 to $3 in deflation globally. It sounds like that Lower 48 increase has kind of begun to plateau or flatten out. I'm just curious on the international front. are you still seeing that deflationary trend that you were witnessing? Or is that going to change at all?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. Hey, Blake. The international deflationary trend has begun to flatten out as we've gone through the year. We're not seeing as strong a deflation percentages in the third quarter as we were say in the first half, so there's a little bit of an offset. At the same time, as I said, it's flattened out in the U.S., so those two are offsetting each other a bit. We still expect as a corporation to be net deflationary in 2017 versus what we saw in 2016.","And internationally, we are still seeing deflation on subsea equipment, seismic costs, offshore rigs, support vessels, even software. Software is another area where we continue to see some deflation this year. And in the U.S., as I said a minute ago, with the industry slowing down a bit, we've seen a flattening. We actually, on some of our contracts in the U.S., even seen downticks versus where we were earlier in the year.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. The second question, I'm sorry if this is a little bit detailed, but I'm kind of having trouble getting to some of the 4Q guidance on production. And if this is something you guys need to follow up with after, that's perfectly fine. But I'm just trying to kind of think about the moving pieces. You've yet to close Barnett, so that's a net negative. And then obviously San Juan and the Panhandle probably come out from a full quarter contribution, but then somewhat offsetting that is an increase of 15,000 barrels a day of the Eagle Ford. Am I kind of addressing all of the right moving pieces there?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. Yes, that's right. Those are all appropriate moving pieces.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. I think that kind of covers what I need, so thank you.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. And so I think when you look at those numbers and compare the underlying, after you adjust for asset sales, and look at kind of midpoint of our 4Q number, you'll see about 4% growth versus the fourth quarter of last year. So year over year, fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2017, you should get about a 4% number.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Blake, there's a chart in the appendix if you haven't seen it that takes you from midpoint to midpoint on a same-store sales basis.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Ellen.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, team. The first question I had was just on Libya. I know we often think about production excluding Libya, but it did stick its head up here in the quarter. So I was curious what you're seeing out there and any thoughts on the sustainability of it in what's obviously a very volatile region.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay. Yeah, Libya is an interesting case because if you look back to last year, we averaged 2,000 barrels a day for the year from Libya, and we just did 24,000 in the third quarter. And we're currently north of 30,000 if you look at sort of what our current production rate is. That's all on a net basis. So it's over 200,000 on a gross basis, current production.","We lifted three cargos from Libya in the third quarter, so that's 10 that we lifted in the first three quarters of the year and in fact, we're lifting another one here just recently, so we're up to 11. We've got six workover rigs active in Libya that's helping drive some of this production increase. So it's getting to be a more significant number, I guess, particularly year-over-year in our bottom-line production.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. That makes sense. And then the follow up is \u2013 and recognizing you guys make very clear that you're price takers that plan for a lower-for-longer crude price environment. But where do you think we are in terms of the crude rebalancing? We obviously have seen products clean up and OPEC compliance has been good and some of the hyper U.S. growth expectations have been moderated. But curious on terms of how you guys are thinking about the market evolving here.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes. I mean, we're seeing the same numbers you are of watching things tighten. And also, it's not hard to predict, with the rollover in U.S. rigs, that that's going to give a different U.S. production profile than I think people were expecting a quarter ago that's also going to tighten things up. But there's also such large wildcards with things like the Libya that we were just talking about, the latest things going on in Kurdistan, et cetera, et cetera. It is a long list of things you can name there.","So for us, you'll see at our Analyst Day here in a few weeks that we're just very focused on not counting on anything good happening for us there on prices. But really keeping our company structure, keeping things tight and disciplined to where we continue to give the results you've seen out of us in the last four or five quarters where we can get good financial results at prices below where we are right now.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Congrats on the good quarter.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Neil.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks, and good morning.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Since it's still morning here in the Central Time Zone. Just trying to stick with the let's not talk too much forward, look a little bit back. You mentioned APLNG running 110%, the breakeven's in that I think $45 to $50 range. I was curious though, if you can run at those kind of levels, and it seems typical in these LNG projects to sort of have a base assumption and then exceed it. Does that lower the breakeven by a material amount? I mean in other words, can APLNG get more competitive as we go forward?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Well I mean, I think the kind of breakevens we've been talking about are based on the performance that we have been achieving for a while now. So the 110% performance is not news, and so that's baked into our numbers, really.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So as good as it gets? No, you don't have to answer that. I'm just -","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, no, I wouldn't say that. I'd hate to leave that impression. But we actually have a lot of work going on to continue to drive down our operating costs and our sustaining capital costs on the upstream side of the project. And so we and the joint venture have significant plans to continue to improve it. I was really just trying to comment on what you asked about, the extra 10% throughput. That's something we've been doing for a while now, and is built into our plans. It's one of the things that pushes you. It does push your breakeven down some, but you shouldn't expect a dramatic change just from that effect.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I know with all the drilling activity, I was just, you know, more volume typically, a little better unit cost structure, I would imagine.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Follow-up question, since I presume earlier when you were talking about the cost inflation\/deflation was more on the CapEx front, can you give us any sort of how the OpEx side \u2013 I know you give the OpEx guidance number, but what are you seeing in terms of cost inflation on the OpEx side? And is any of that a function of the non-operated part of your portfolio as well?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, so on OpEx side, let me just mention some of the numbers. Our third quarter OpEx number that we just published this morning is down 15%, on the adjusted OpEx that we focus on, down 15% versus the same quarter in 2016. And obviously there is asset sales that are built into that.","If you look at the same store sales basis and take out all the asset sales confusion from that, basically we're right on our original budget guidance, but we're doing that with a couple percent higher volume, so our budget was originally based on a midpoint 1% volume increase. It's that 0% to 2% range, midpoint 1% and we're accomplishing 3%. And so basically we've been able to eat all the extra OpEx, transportation, et cetera that comes with those extra barrels and still meet our guidance.","So as I look forward into what we're doing there, we're certainly not done on our OpEx work in the corporation. We have a lot of focus on it around the world, and I expect that we will continue to see additional improvement there. From the inflation side, the story is pretty similar to what I was talking about on CapEx, that it's a little bit to the benefit to us in 2017 versus 2016 so far.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And we'll see you in about a week and a half.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Okay.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much. If I could just maybe follow up on the pension contribution. Don, can you talk about what made that discretionary payment more attractive than, let's say, accelerating some further debt repayment and maybe also address the level of funding relative to the obligation.","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Yes, Jason. So I think what we're looking, the way we looked at it is, is that this was a really good way to put a portion of our large cash balance to work. So essentially what we're doing is moving cash from short-term low return investments on the balance sheet to the pension fund that can invest in much longer-term higher-yield type return in investments, and so it's an arbitrage there. We compared it to incrementally to reducing the next best bond retirement opportunity that we had, and it had advantaged economics with respect to that.","And then your other question was around the level of funding of the plan, I believe. So with this contribution, and this was to the U.S. qualified plan, it would bring our funding level up to right around 85%. And that will be, if I remember correctly, that will be about the highest level of funding that we've had since before the spin of the company in 2012. The liability for that U.S. pension fund would be down from a little over $1 billion, I believe $1.1 billion before this contribution to bring it down to about $0.5 billion.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. Very clear. And I almost hesitate to ask this follow-up question, given that I'm sure we'll hear a lot about your premium Eagle Ford position in a couple of weeks, but another operator did take a pretty big writedown in the Eagle Ford today and talked about how they had significantly down spaced further than what their acreage would actually produce at optimally. So I was hoping maybe you could just address it at a very high level what distinguishes your position from some of the other operators there.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, so obviously I can't comment on any of the details of the other operator's results, but clearly it doesn't apply to us. We've been very deliberate in our development plans there in the Eagle Ford. We're very tailored to the specific reservoir characteristics, the different areas. You know that we're right in the sweet spot. We've got a lot of running room. You remember that map that we showed at last year's Analyst Day, Ellen tells me it's page 48 of last year's deck that showed -","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","We can show you last year's material.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, showed how much running room we have there. So we really have no concerns or anything like that. Our Eagle Ford continues to make us proud and outperform and even took a beating from hurricane Harvey and came back pretty quickly right back up to full production.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. I appreciate that. I think it's just useful to distinguish you from some of the other operators. Appreciate that.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Thank you for taking the question. Al, on the production side, you did a good job highlighting the outperformance of your base portfolio. Can you speak to the performance year to date from the major projects that have been ramping up? You gave some color on Surmont, so it looks like that's getting closer to max rates, maybe where that is right now. But then Malikai as well, maybe specifically, has that fully ramped up? And then where are we on the KBB gas ramp up?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Sure. On Surmont, we'll be fully ramped basically end of the year or early next year, we'll be at our full rate. So we're right toward the end of that. Malikai, we are still ramping and won't hit the plateau there until next year, in 2018.","And KBB has been kind of an odd story, because we've had gas availability from our side for a long time, for several years and have been limited by non-owned third party infrastructure that has had some pretty significant maintenance issues, and which have slowly been getting lined down. And so we are seeing higher volumes from KBB in recent weeks actually, and expect it to be part of what allows us to grow volumes a bit into the fourth quarter as we've been basically allocated a higher rate from KBB into MLNG. And so I think that year-over-year, we'll see higher rates again in 2018 versus 2017 for KBB because of that effect.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Yes. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is on the capital spending side, you highlighted some of the variables that might contribute to a bit higher CapEx going into 4Q, with higher Lower 48 activity a partial driver there. Are there any specific offsets you would call out into next year? And I'm thinking specifically about if there is any noteworthy major project longer cycle spend maybe associated with Surmont, or other projects that's set to fall off on a year over year basis. Or if lower CapEx going forward is just going to be a function of you guys continuing to get more efficient and capture deflation where you can.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, there's a lot of moving parts there, to answer that question. And so we are going to have a segment in two weeks at the Analyst Meeting where we give you some fairly detailed plots and charts that show you how all those pieces add up from both a capital perspective and a production volume perspective. So I think that's probably the best way to answer that, is to point to those charts.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Fair enough. Thank you.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick kind of housekeeping items. As we watch spot LNG prices in Asia picking up, can you remind what portion of your APLNG exports are fixed-price versus what's being sold in the spot market?","Donald E. Wallette, Jr. - ConocoPhillips","Well, this is Don. From APLNG, 100% of the gas from APLNG that's not dedicated to the domestic market is contracted under long-term contracts to customers in China and Japan. Now those customers have a right to reduce their obligation by up to 10% in any particular year, and so that can make as much as 10% of the capacity available for the spot market.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then on Libya.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","I can add to that, in fact, our customers have taken that downward quantity tolerance for 2018, and that's what's made these spot cargos available in 2018 that we've been in this discussion with the government about, about making those available as domestic gas.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Understood. And then on Libya, so you're up to 24,000 BPD. If you were to get back to pre-revolution, pre-2011 normalized levels, how much higher would that number get all else being equal?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, if you go back, we were in the 40,000 to 50,000 range net, back when if you can ever define normal there again, that's the kind of rate we were at.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question is from Michael Hall of Heikkinen. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks very much. A lot of mine have been addressed, but I guess quickly on Surmont following up on that, from the prior question, do you have what that averaged during the third quarter in terms of contribution from Surmont?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","In terms of the volumes?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Correct.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yes, 63,000 barrels a day was the 3Q number for Surmont.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And as we think about kind of maintenance capital levels for Canada coming out of the year after Surmont's effectively ramped up, how should we think about that? If you could provide it.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","You're thinking about the maintenance CapEx, you mean?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Correct, yeah.","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","Yeah, so I mean it's down to a pretty low level. Not sure I've got a number handy, but it's with the point that we've gotten to now, and particularly with some of the technology work we've been doing to improve things, the need to spend CapEx on a sustaining is down to a pretty low level.","We're going to show you at our Analyst Meeting in a couple weeks some other kind of margin improvement projects that we have planned there that are low dollar, but we'll show you kind of how that adds up. So there is still some work to be done there at Surmont given current market conditions on the diluent side, et cetera., to allow us to improve our margins there, and we'll talk about that a little bit in a couple weeks.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. And then as I think about like I guess fourth quarter capital spending levels, is there anything kind of one off or one time within that spending level that we should not think about as recurring?","Alan J. Hirshberg - ConocoPhillips","No. I'm not expecting any big lumps, like a dry hole expense or any of those kind of things in the fourth quarter. I can't think of any lumpy one-off type stuff.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillips","Thanks, Michael, and Christine, thank you very much. If you would close this out. We look forward to seeing everybody in a couple weeks.

The material for that meeting, including a transcript of that call, is still available from our website, and that's also where you'll find the materials for today's presentation.","One other kind of quick administrative matter: Except as noted, today's comments as we go through the presentation will address the company's performance on a continuing operations basis, and that is net of the results for the settled properties that we've previously reported as discontinued operations. So just listen for that. We know the models have a mix of conventions and so we want to be clear about the convention we plan to follow today.","If you'll turn to Page 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor slide. We will make some forward-looking statements today, and of course, our actual results could differ. The risks in our future performance have been outlined and described on the Safe Harbor statement and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our recently filed Form 10-K.","And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","All right. Thank you, Ellen. And good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the time to join us on our call today. I'll begin my comments on Slide 3 and cover some of the key first quarter highlights.","Strategically, we continue to make good progress on our announced asset sales. In the first quarter, we closed the Cedar Creek Anticline transaction and some small asset sales, which generated total proceeds of about $1.1 billion. We're also making progress in our sales of our Algeria, Nigeria and Kashagan assets and anticipate closing those in 2013. At the same time, as we work to monetize these non-core nonstrategic assets in our portfolio, we continue to add assets, which will allow us to sustain our long-term growth. We added acreage in our deepwater Gulf of Mexico position and continue to make selective entries in the new exploration plays globally. But Matt is going to provide more information about our investment programs during his comments later in the call.","Operationally, the business ran well, and we achieved the high end of our estimated production range for the quarter. We produced 1.596 million BOE per day on a total company basis and 1.55 million per day on a continuing operations basis. We announced 2 significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries in the first quarter at Shenandoah and Coronado, and these are important milestones in our emerging deepwater Gulf of Mexico program.","Moving to financial results. Adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion, it's $1.42 a share. Special items this quarter were $387 million, which were primarily related to gains on asset sales. Excluding a $1 billion net working capital gain benefit, we generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $5.4 billion of cash on hand. Our debt level was unchanged from year end. So overall, we had a strong quarter strategically, operationally and financially.","And if you turn to the next slide, I'll discuss our earnings for the quarter. So it was a straightforward quarter, with adjusted earnings relatively flat with comparative periods. This quarter's adjusted earnings were down about 2% compared to last year's first quarter, primarily driven by lower benchmark prices and higher DD&A expense which were partially offset by our shift to higher-value liquids in our portfolio and lower corporate expenses.","Adjusted earnings per share was up 3%, which reflects the share repurchases in the first half of 2012. Sequentially, adjusted earnings were essentially flat. Slightly lower total company volumes were offset by somewhat higher product prices, with the notable exception of bitumen pricing which remained weak in the first quarter. As I mentioned, production volumes hit the high end of our guidance range, and operating costs were as expected, so there are no surprises there.","Next I'll cover our production performance for the quarter, so if you'll turn to the next slide. As I mentioned a moment ago, our all-in production this year's first quarter was 1.596 million BOE per day, and these results included about 40,000 BOE per day from discontinued operations. So this Slide 5 shows how production compares to the first quarter of 2012.","First quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.58 million BOE per day. And if you adjust that for the 45,000 of production from assets that were sold during 2012, normalized production from continued operations was 1.536 million BOE in the first quarter of last year. So if you compare that to the first quarter 2013, our downtime from continuing operations was 30,000 BOE per day higher in the first quarter 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012. This downtime is primarily due to weather-related issues in the San Juan Basin and downtime at the East Irish Sea Rivers asset plant.","Production growth of 219,000 BOE per day more than offset decline of 170,000 BOE per day. The majority of this growth came from the Lower 48 shale plays and our oil sands assets, and we had some production increases year-over-year from Libya and China.","So normalized for 2012 dispositions, our production from continuing operations increased from 1.536 million to 1.555 million BOE per day year-over-year, and that represents about a 1% growth in total. And this growth would have been higher were it not for the increased downtime we had in the first quarter. So while we experienced slight year-on-year production growth from our continuing operations, the composition of that production shifted, leading to improved cash margins, and the next slide discusses those cash margins.","As you can see, cash margins are growing despite a 3% drop in realized prices compared to last year's first quarter. Our cash margins grew by 6%. One of the biggest drivers in this margin improvement is the shift to higher-value liquids in our portfolio. So liquids production from crude, from NGL and from bitumen increased to 57% of production compared to 55% a year ago. So this metric is likely to evolve, though, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but the long-term trend should be one of increasing cash margins as we shift our production towards higher-value products. And we will continue to focus on this metric since it's one of the key aspects of our value proposition.","So next I'll turn to the segment slide, beginning with the Lower 48 on Slide 7. Production in this segment was 475,000 BOE per day. That's up 5% compared to last year's first quarter, as we continue to successfully ramp up production in the Lower 48 shale plays. Total liquids production in this segment increased 17% over the same period a year ago, while natural gas production decreased by 4%. Sequentially, production was flat from the -- for the segment, reflecting the unplanned downtime in the San Juan Basin related to winter weather conditions.","So with the 17% growth in liquids production, liquids now represent approximately 50% of the production mix in this segment, up from 45% a year ago. And we expect our liquids production percentage to continue to grow.","During the quarter, Eagle Ford production averaged 101,000 BOE per day, Permian production averaged 52,000, Bakken production averaged 29,000 BOE per day. So total production from these 3 areas was 182,000 BOE per day, and for -- and that's up 42% compared to the same period last year.","In terms of earnings, realized prices tell most of the story on earnings variability. Sequentially, in this year's first quarter, volumes were flat, but earnings benefit from stronger crude prices.","So next we'll move to the Canada segment on Slide 8. Canadian production was 283,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. That's up 6% year-over-year, driven by the ramp-up in -- of production in our oil sands assets. Liquids production increased 22% year-over-year, while gas price -- gas production declined 7%. And this shift should show up in improved margins over time with recovering bitumen prices.","Canada reported negative adjusted earnings this quarter, reflecting weak bitumen prices that carried over from late last year. As a reminder, our realizations embed a 1-month lag in WCS spot prices, so our first quarter results essentially reflect pricing in December, January and February. Since we already know that March and April prices for bitumen are higher, we expect second quarter realizations to improve compared to the first quarter.","So let's move on to the Alaska segment on Slide 9. Production in Alaska was 218,000 BOE per day this quarter. That's down sequentially but in line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, production was down about 18,000 BOE per day, reflecting normal field decline. In the first quarter, lift timing had an adverse impact to earnings of about $50 million. And adjusted earnings were $543 million for the segment.","As most of you know, the Alaska legislature passed SB 21, representing some reforms to the existing fiscal regime. We are currently analyzing the possible impact to our business, including where we could or would increase investment in Alaska, and we expect to provide more details of -- on our future plans over time.","So I'll turn to Slide 10 and talk about our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. Production in this segment was 318,000 BOE per day during the first quarter, and that's up 5% compared to a year ago and about flat sequentially. One milestone to note is we achieved our first sale of our cargo oil from the Gumusut field in Malaysia in January.","Adjusted earnings this quarter were favorably impacted by about $20 million related to lift timings, and they benefited from continuing -- continued strong pricing sequentially.","Europe is the next segment, and it's found on Slide 11. Production for Europe was 207,000 BOE per day during the quarter, a sequential decrease of 9,000 BOE per day. Natural field declines, asset dispositions and continued downtime primarily at the East Irish Sea facility continued to lower production volumes compared to the first quarter of last year. Now the adjusted earnings of $348 million for this segment did not include any significant timing differences this quarter.","So we don't have an Other International segment or a corporate slide in our presentation this quarter, as there wasn't much news. As a reminder, most of what was previously in the international segment is now reported in our discontinued operations. Our corporate segment's adjusted earnings were a negative $173 million. That's in line with our fourth quarter performance but ahead of our quarterly guidance. And we're going to provide an update on our full year outlook for corporate expenses at the Second Quarter Call in midyear. So -- and further information on this segment is provided in the supplemental information that's provided with the earnings release.","So if you turn to Slide 12. I'll cover our first quarter cash flow. We generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations this quarter, excluding working capital. And working capital was a source of $1 billion in cash. We also generated $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Cedar Creek Anticline asset and some other small assets.","So you'll notice that the working capital change this quarter is large, and the biggest single component of this change relates to the impact of the Cedar Creek Anticline asset sales -- asset sale. The -- and the nature of accounting for asset sales is that the pretax value of the asset sale's proceeds shows up on the cash flow statement in the cash from investing activities, but the tax impacts from asset sales end up in the cash from operations portion of the cash flow statement. And tax impacts from the CCA disposition has impacted both the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 cash from operations -- cash from operating activities. So absent the impacts from this transaction, cash flow from operations before working capital would have been approximately $4 billion in both the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 and the working capital change in the first quarter of 2013 would have been closer to $600 million.","Moving to capital. We funded a $3.6 billion capital program for continuing operations in the quarter. And we expect that capital expenditures will be higher in the subsequent quarters of 2013.","So finishing up the cash flow statement. We paid out roughly $800 million in our recent quarterly dividend, and this left us with a strong cash position at quarter end of around $5.4 billion.","So our balance sheet and the financials situation remain strong. We continue to be well positioned to execute on our -- on the programs that are going to generate the volume and margin growth for the company.","So that concludes the financial overview. And now I'll turn over call over to Matt for an update on operations.","Matthew J. Fox","Thanks, Jeff.","As both Ellen and Jeff mentioned, general theme of this quarter's operational performance is that we are on plan. Jeff covered the financials results by segment, but I'm going to cover the operations material by the capital buckets we reviewed at the Analyst Meeting in February. So these are our high-quality base, our relatively low-risk development programs that completely mitigate base decline, our major projects and our exploration programs. And we think of these buckets as distinct parts of our strategy that, when aggregated, will drive growth in volumes, margins and returns over time.","So let's start with our base asset discussion on Page 14. Just as a reminder, our base refers to the assets that we're producing at the end of last year, which comprised about 1.5 million BOE per day of continuing operations.","During the first quarter of this year, our base production performed essentially as expected. Around the business were some winter-related downtime in the San Juan Basin that Jeff talked about, the majority of which has been restored. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, our Calder field in East Irish Sea is down, pending completion of a new asset plant.","As we discussed in the Fourth Quarter Call and at the Analyst Meeting, I want to remind you that we have some significant downtime planned during the next 2 quarters. In our operated assets alone, we expect downtime to be about 30% higher than our 5-year historic average, and much of this higher downtime is related to what then needs to be performed to tie in new production in many of our operations. And we also expect higher-than-average downtime in several of our key non-operated assets this year. So I thought it would be worthwhile taking a moment to give you some highlights listed on this slide.","First, the Greater Ekofisk complex schedules a major shutdown every 3 years during the summer. This year's planned shutdown will be the largest ever in the Greater Ekofisk area, and in fact, it will be the largest shutdown in ConocoPhillips' history. So this is a big deal, and our planning is going well. The shutdown at Ekofisk itself will start in early June and last about a month. In addition to planned maintenance, we will be completing ground fieldwork for Ekofisk South production beginning later this year. Also Eldfisk is planned to shut down in late May for a period of about 70 days, this work will include preparations for the tie-in and startup of Eldfisk 2 in late 2014.","Likewise, in U.K., we have a significant J-Area shutdown planned also for June coinciding with the Greater Ekofisk shutdown. And similar to the Norway work, a key goal of this planned event is to make preparations for the Jasmine field tie-in and startup later in the year. We also have significant turnarounds planned in Alaska, the oil sands, Indonesia and the Lower 48. So this really is a big year for planned shutdowns.","But before I leave this slide, I want to make a key point. Our 2013 production guidance hasn't changed, except we've narrowed the range for the full year and have slight increase to the midpoint. We provided quarterly detail for our 2013 production outlook in the Appendix section of today's presentation, and we presented this information for both continuing operations and discontinued operations for the rest of this year. And we've shown both conventions because we know there's a mix in the analyst modules out there. We want to make sure there's no confusion.","Now let me give you a little more color specifically on the Lower 48 second quarter volume expectations. The sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline properties will reduce our base production by about 11,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter. That, combined with the second quarter planned downtime and underlying decline, should be completely offset by production growth from our development programs, so as a result, we expect second quarter production from the Lower 48 to be about the same as first quarter production.","So moving on to the development programs, on Slide 15. These are the low-risk drilling-led programs around the world that completely mitigate a decline with high margins and high returns. These programs remain on track across the globe to deliver the 600,000 BOE per day of production by 2017, that you can see in the top left graphic. Among our legacy fields, in Alaska, Kaparuk coiled tubing drilling sidetracks continued; and Western Canada, with its high uptime due to mild weather and good results from this year's winter drilling program.","Results across the Lower 48 development programs are also strong. So beginning in Eagle Ford, first quarter production averaged 101,000 BOE per day, with a peak net production of 110,000 BOE per day. So volumes were up 13% sequentially compared to 89,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of last year.","We expect to complete the drilling phase of each acreage capture in the Eagle Ford by mid this year and then be fully held by production by the end of the year. And as we approach this milestone, we're focused on planning for full field development.","Moving to the Bakken. Production averaged 29,000 BOE a day, an increase of 5,000 versus the fourth quarter or about 21% increase. In both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken plays, we continue to evaluate and implement infrastructure and marketing solutions to improve our margins. For example, we continue to install stabilizers in the Eagle Ford to allow us to more effectively ship our light crude production.","In the Permian Basin, we're increasing activity in both the conventional and the unconventional plays where we hold 1.1 million net acres. We're currently testing several unconventional plays in both the Delaware and Midland Basin. For example, we're seeing good results from early tests of Avalon wells in the Delaware Basin where about 60% of the production stream is liquids. And we hope to have more results here to share soon.","In the Permian conventional development program, we now have our 4-operated rigs running. Our current plan assumes we'll bring on about 135 wells this year, an increase of 48% compared to 2012. So these efforts will protect our base production against generating strong margin and returns. So we've got a lot of good things going on in our development programs and we will have for the remainder of the year.","Now let's turn to our major projects on Slide 16.  Our major projects remain on track to deliver the 400,000 BOE per day of production by 2017 that you can see in the top-left graph. Our oil sands properties continue to perform on plan. And currently, we have 7 major projects in execution there. The combined oil sand properties averaged 109,000 BOE per day during the quarter, up 3% sequentially. Christina Lake Phase E is on track to start up in the third quarter of this year, which will contribute to the continuing ramp-up of production.","In the Asia Pacific region, an additional 8 Panyu Growth wells are brought online in the first quarter, bringing the total new well count to 17 wells, and these wells contributed more than 6,000 BOE per day net by the end of the quarter. In Malaysia, the floating production system from Gumusut and the Siakap North-Petai projects are both on track for a fourth quarter startup. At Curtis Island, module installation got underway at APLNG this quarter. This is a big milestone for the project, and it shows that we're still on schedule for first LNG in 2015.","Activity in both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea is high. The picture shown in the bottom left here is of the Jasmine topside installation that began in March and was completed earlier this month. The offshore hookup and commissioning work has now commenced, with first production still expected in the fourth quarter. At Ekofisk South, the project is progressing well. We're on plan for selling [ph] in June. We expect the set the topside this summer and achieve first oil production by the end of this year.","So as you can tell, it's a very busy year for major projects in ConocoPhillips. We've got a lot of exciting things underway in terms of growth and margin catalysts. For example, the 4 major projects we're bringing on this year, Jasmine, Ekofisk South Gumusut and SNP, hold a total average production of about 80,000 BOE per day in 2014. But this is actually only half of the total production that will be added from all of our major projects in 2014. We'll also add production from projects at FCCL, increasing production at APLNG for domestic sales and several other smaller projects around the company. And of course, there's the incremental production in 2014 that is an addition to the production that we'll be adding from our development programs, which essentially maintain base production flat.","Now the next 2 quarters are really important, but I know our people are up to the task of safely executing our plans.","So next I want to briefly cover our exploration programs, starting with the Gulf of Mexico on Slide 17. As most of you know, we announced 2 significant Gulf of Mexico deepwater discoveries this quarter: Shenandoah and Coronado. Shenandoah was the first appraisal well following a 2009 discovery, and we have 30% equity. This first appraisal well exceeded pre-drill expectations of over 1,000 feet of net pay. And it looks to have good reservoir quality and good oil quality. And unfortunately, we drilled down depth of the discovery well but we didn't find a water column.","At Coronado, we announced the discovery of a large 3-way closure, subsalt. This well discovered more than 400 feet of net pay, with good-quality reservoir. And we have 35% of this discovery. And the operators is now on location drilling an appraisal sidetrack from the discovery well.","During the quarter, we continued to build a leasehold position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico through our participation in the recent March lease sale. The chart in the lower left shows our growing acreage position, much of which is still in primary term, and the flexibility this provides as a real advantage.","Then finally, in the Gulf of Mexico, we've got a very active drilling program underway or planned for the remainder of the year. Currently, we're drilling at the Ardennes well, a lower-tertiary wildcat, and we have 30% interest in the well. We expect to spud the COP-operated Thorn well any day now, which is an upper-tertiary wildcat where we have 65% working interest. Also coming up in the second quarter, the Tiber appraisal well is expected to spud, where have an 18% interest. And then later in the year, the Deep Nansen wildcat well will spud, which is a lower tertiary prospect where we have a 25% interest.","So 2013 is clearly a very big year for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico program. We're really excited about this, and we hope that we have other meaningful results to share with you as the year progresses.","Moving to Slide 18. And here, I just want to take a minute to update you on our other unconventional and conventional exploration programs outside the Gulf of Mexico. In Canada, we drilled, logged and cored 2 wells in the Canol play. This is a Devonian shale that we believe is in the oil window on Train, with a prolific Horn River gas play. We're planning to go back to this area next winter for a multi-well program, including a horizontal well production test.","In the Niobrara play, we drilled 3 wells in the first quarter. Currently, our pace is somewhat limited by gathering and infrastructure build-out here. Our well results are encouraging, but it's still early days. In the second quarter, we expect to drill our first well in Colombia in the Middle Magdalena basin in the La Luna shale play.","Moving on to our conventional programs. In Alaska, we drilled a wildcat discovery at the Cassin prospect in the onshore NPR-A. In Kwanza Basin in Angola we completed the second phase of our 3D seismic program in early April, and we're in full planning mode to begin drilling early next year. And finally, in the Browse Basin of Australia, we're currently drilling a Proteus wildcat in an untested structure to the southeast of the Poseidon discovery, and we expect to reach TD in late May. So there've been a lot exploration activity in the first quarter, and that continues into the second quarter.","So that was a pretty quick overview of our operations, which are running well, very high level of activity, and generating visible results.","So now, please return to Slide 19, and I'll wrap up with some summary comments. I think the most important takeaway from today's call is that the business is running well. I hope Jeff and I have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones in 2013 that will position us for a very strong 2014.","Our value proposition remains intact. We expect to make progress on our announced asset divestitures in 2013, which will provide financial flexibility for funding our growth programs, and our dividend remains a top priority.","Operationally, we're approaching a very significant inflection point for the company, the momentum coming out of 2013 should be strong. We're delivering visible results from our conventional and unconventional exploration programs that will sustain our growth into the future. And very importantly, we're delivering our operational performance safely and efficiently.","Finally, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that can provide financial flexibility. We're seeing the early stages of cash margin expansion, which should improve as our volumes grow. And as always, we'll maintain our focus on improving returns.","The bottom line is that we are committed to creating long-term value by delivering 3% to 5% growth in production and margins, with a compelling dividend. We're executing on this strategy, and we're committed to keeping you updated on our progress.","So now we are pleased to take your questions. And Christine, I'll hand it back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give us an exit rate in the quarter for the Eagle Ford.","Matthew J. Fox","The exit rate was about 110,000 BOE per day, and for -- and we're continuing to grow production. I think we had a new peak production on Monday of 116,000 BOE per day in Eagle Ford.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So -- and where do you kind of see this going towards the end of the year at?","Matthew J. Fox","Right now, in the Eagle Ford, we're in a pretty linear growth trend. And we will see that continuing essentially as we go through the year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the recent change in the legislation in Alaska on the progressive tax, what do you mean? You said you're going to add a rig to Alaska. What's the current thinking now with the new tax regime in place?","Matthew J. Fox","So we've been encouraged by the changes to the regime. We've been advocating this for some time. And then the change will encourage additional investment in Alaska. So we're -- and we were looking at that. We've got a long list of projects that we are evaluating now. And we did announce that we're immediate starting to increase with this new rig that we're bringing in and that rig is going to be very focused on working over existing wells and adding production that way. But we do have quite a few capital projects that we're now evaluating the impacts of the fiscal regime on.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And this is still in terms of Alaska. So the -- you guys laid out, I guess, a production sort of decline in Alaska over the course of this year. Does this rig and the new activities sort of mitigate that decline rate, and by how much?","Matthew J. Fox","You won't really see any significant change in the short term. But the -- but the issue is given the new fiscal regime, our incremental capital investments worth are now competitive. And we think they will be, but we're taking that through our overall planning process this year. And we'll be more equipped to talk about that later in the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","In March, at the Analyst Meeting, the company provided a pretty detailed outlook for production and cash margins. And on this point, I think U.S. production from liquid-rich play rose by over 40% versus the year-ago period, which is obviously a pretty strong result. But my question is on profitability and specifically whether cash margins in these plays are strengthening, as you thought that they might, and also whether there are any other performance-related factors that are worth mentioning in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Permian developments that you have underway?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, the -- pretty much. As Matt mentioned, the production is happening pretty much as we expected from all 3 plays, the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Permian. And production from these is all -- well, Eagle Ford is 60% oil and 20% NGLs and 20% gas, so that's really strong cash margins. And Bakken, of course, is mostly oil. And the Permian is a -- got a very favorable mix as well. So cash margins from all these assets are really much higher than our -- than the average of our current portfolio. So as you see, the portfolio, the whole -- you're starting to see that show up now finally in Lower 48 cash margins as that portfolio has moved now towards kind of about half liquids to where it was only 45% a year ago. So you're getting to -- you're starting to see that all across the portfolio. Cash margins have been a little bit hurt in Canada because of the recent weakness in bitumen prices, but we see that that's going to start recovering as well. So overall, the -- it's kind of Matt was summarizing. We see the trajectory of the growth in production happening as we thought it was going to. And it's -- that trajectory of growing production is going to cause -- growing the production at higher margins is going to cause cash margin to increase over time. So production growth is on plan and margin growth is on plan as well.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Jeff, I think that you mentioned your efforts on optimization and how higher net backs, as I think the way you talked about it. And on this point, I wanted to see if you could highlight some of the specifics that are being undertaken to improve the netbacks to the company on production.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think we talked about how a lot of -- in particular, what we're trying to make sure is that it's not going to be talking about [ph] marketing in Eagle Ford, for example. Matt, maybe you want to talk some about what we're doing there?","Matthew J. Fox","Yes. So our goal here, Doug, is to have as much optionality as we can because, as you know, there's a lot of volatility and various markers in the production itself in all 3 of those basins. So we're -- so for example, in the Eagle Ford, just now, the way that we're set up for our sales, we're realizing WTI plus about $5 from Eagle Ford, and that's a mixture of production that's going by pipeline. A lot of production is still going by truck. And some of our production is priced off LLS, some of it's priced off WTI. And our liquids, the non-NGL liquids, are sold as a light sweet crude. And because they've got very high-value metal distillate, that makes them good refinery products, so they're not going being sold as condensate. And so we're -- and we feel good about the liquid and the gas takeaway capacity just now in the Eagle Ford. In the Bakken, we're actually realizing WTI minus about $5 on average in the Bakken. And we've got a mixture of offtake as well: About 30% is by pipeline just now, about 25% we're selling to rails -- to railers to bring it south to capture the WTI-Brent spread. And so we're managing that, I think, very well. And we're developing a lot of optionality to make sure that we have flexibility to maximize our realizations.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Rakesh for Ed. Quick question on your -- if you can give any updates on your Canadian asset disposals, where we are in the process over there.","Matthew J. Fox","Yes. We're still evaluating our options for diluting our position in the Canadian oil sands. We've got quite a few alternatives that we're considering, quite a lot of interest in those assets, and -- but we're not in a hurry. This is an important strategic transaction for the company so we're still thinking through the -- which of these alternatives we want to pursue.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is real quick. Matt, I think, in Eagle Ford, that you're primarily frac oil. And do you have any rough estimate in terms of the spread between frac oil, condensate, NGL and gas for your position in the Niobrara, Wolfcamp and Canol Shale?","Matthew J. Fox","It's still very early days from the -- in all of those. And they -- we do see -- have a higher liquids yield in the Niobrara, for example. And the wells we've tested there all have a high crude oil yield. The -- in the Permian, I think the most recent stuff I saw from our Avalon wells was 60% crude oil percentage. And then I think you mentioned the Canol. We don't have a well test in the Canol yet, we just had -- we just tried -- drilled and cored and logged to those wells, so we don't have an estimate of that yet.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Matt, when you say crude oil, you're really referring is frac oil, it's not condensate and NGL, right, when you say 60% in the Wolfcamp?","Matthew J. Fox","That's correct. That's right.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And that in the Colombia, when you drilled the first well, the vertical well, are you going to also frac it? Are you just going to, say, get some core sample?","Matthew J. Fox","I think the, first well, we're just going to get core samples and some frac -- some dynamic fracture testing. But I don't think we plan to run a full frac on the first well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And maybe this is for Jeff, that any update about the Canadian oil sand sales, where we -- where are we in the process?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","I think, as Matt mentioned, I think, on -- previously, we're still evaluating the options that we have in the Canadian oil sands process. And that's something that we're going to be taking our time doing because there are a lot of different potential routes we could go with that transaction.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So we should not necessarily assume that this is going to have a final decision made by company within this year.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, I think that'll be fair. It's a transaction we're going to be working on throughout this year and could potentially be in the next year as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Matt, on the -- on Shenandoah, that is a monster well. Given that it's so great in terms of the size, should we assume from a time line standpoint, the development, you may actually need to -- at least another 2 year for additional appraisal well and then, after that, 2 year of the same [ph] and then maybe 4 year of the actual construction of the platform and all that? So were you talking about more like in the 2020, 2021 kind of time line?","Matthew J. Fox","So we're still working that, Paul. It's a good question. And we're in the middle of working out the time line and the appraisal requirements for that well. And so it's too early to give you a time line for that.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions, please. Matt, on the Eagle Ford, there's -- a number of companies now have started to chatter about the Pearsall and the [indiscernible] on their recent acreage. I'm just wondering if you are moving that -- in that direction and if there's anything you can share with us in terms of how it might augment the existing program.","Matthew J. Fox","Yes, yes, we know that, that potential exists on our acreage. And so that's -- we're really regarding that right now as upside relative to the Eagle Ford shale itself. But you're right, that potential could be quite significant.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But nothing in terms of exploration activity or appraisal activity at this point.","Matthew J. Fox","Not right now. No, not right now.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, my follow-up is on the cash margin comment. I'm looking for a bit of help here, really. This is probably the key to -- or one of the keys to the investment case, I guess, is the growth and the margin expansion, you spent a fair amount of time talking about it. Your liquids production was up 57% versus 55% as a proportion, but every liquids realization year-over-year was down pretty quite materially and the only realization that was up was gas. So I'm trying to understand, how does the cash margin grow in that environment? But my numbers is not growing, and I'm trying to understand how you're getting to these numbers. Are you normalizing for the base portfolio after asset sales? Or is there something else going on there?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","So let me kind of take that in kind of short-term and long-term impact. So...","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm looking Q1 over Q1...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. It's what I would call short-term impacts. Cash margins, there's -- always, there are going to be a lot of things that go into cash margins that would create a lot of noise when you look kind of quarter-over-quarter or even somewhat year-over-year. So it depends not just on what price levels happened -- or what went on with price levels, which moved a little bit in this year-over-year time period. As we showed our realized price, overall it went down by about 3%. overall. The cash margins went up. So it's what is making up -- it's the tax rates at which those -- that production is happening, as well, makes a lot of difference. And as you point out, we did have some improvement in natural gas prices in that time frame, which helped margins. So what we showed in the call today which is what happened to actual cash margins year-over-year, including the impact of prices. Now what we think is important, though, is what happened in the cash margins over the long term kind of in a flat price environment, and that's what we really tend to talk more about, like that we spend a lot of time talking about it in the analyst presentation. And as you go long term, it's the impact of adding oil production, LNG production, oil sands production, and changing the mix in the portfolio, as well as the geographies in which you add them. And that's just the same way we pointed out on today's call that you could observe year-over-year cash margins increases and there's going to be noise around that as we go forward. And I won't say that every quarter we'll see an increase but, over time, as we move our portfolio to higher liquids percentages and change the geographies, that you're going to see an improvement in that cash margin.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, only just to be clear, then. I'm looking at first quarter '13 over first quarter '12, you're saying it's up 6%. How much of that was the gas price improvement?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Gee, I don't know. I don't think I've -- we haven't dissected to that and try to allocate it out to different components.","Operator","Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had a question for you, in the Gulf of Mexico. You talked about Shenandoah. And as I understand that you've got about 180,000 acres in -- primarily in the Green Canyon area where you have 100% and, I believe, the plants are to start drilling in that in 2014. I'm just curious if -- how we should think about farm-down potential there. Do you maybe have increased appetite to keep a higher working interest given the success in the area?","Matthew J. Fox","I think it's more likely that we would start drilling there in maybe 2015 than 2014. We've got some new high-quality seismic across that whole acreage position that you're referring to, and we expect to see some very high and -- good-looking prospects there. And until we get to the stage where we're ready to get them on the drilling program, that's when we'll think about if we went to bring someone in before we drill, to farm-in. So we haven't got to the stage of making that decision yet, but we really are quite excited about that zip code. This is definitely looking very good.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. Secondly, I guess it's on the natural gas side. I always view Conoco as having probably more leverage than peers to U.S. natural gas. And certainly, that creates some optionality. I -- obviously, we haven't heard anything on increased activity just yet, but is there a certain price that we should kind of earmark as -- say, $5 in Mcf, where maybe you would begin to increase in activity there?","Matthew J. Fox","We did have a lot of potential there transactionally. We're really focusing our investment just now on the liquids-rich assets. And of course, we get associated gas with that, so we benefit from the gas price there. And I would say that -- I wouldn't see us redirecting any capital towards gas assets until we're seeing it significantly north of the current prices, the...","Ellen R. DeSanctis","On a sustained basis.","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes. And I think that's the point to it: We'd have to get comfortable the prices have made some kind of move that is sustainable to a higher level.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And Jeff, saying that, I'm assuming -- I mean, given your history, you're not the type to hedge, so I'm assuming that's not something you'd be looking to do...","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","That's correct. You'd be -- you don't likely to see us hedge.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Mei of Tudor, Pickering.","Brandon Mei","Just on the Gulf of Mexico exploration plans. Obviously, you've got a lot going on there. But just wanted to get some color on how you see the new prospects and how they differ from what you've learned on Shenandoah and Coronado. And then secondly, I think you have one rig, operator rig, for Thorn. Just wanted to see if there's opportunity to increase that.","Matthew J. Fox","Yes. So we -- across our Gulf of Mexico portfolio, we've got a mixture of pliocene, miocene and then the lower tertiary. The majority of the increase we've been picking up has been focused on the lower tertiary. And then we do have some balance in the portfolio there. We have this operated wide single slot to drill the Thorn well, and then we have -- we're picking up a long-term rig contract with a new-build first coming in, in 2014, the beginning of 2014, and we're sharing that 50-50 with another operator. And we're currently evaluating our needs for more rig capability in the Gulf of Mexico and the deepwater rig capability in general. So we expect to be adding to our operator capacity here over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe just to beat the cash margin horse a little bit more. As you're looking at it, as we think over next, let's say, certainly the next couple of quarters where we're going to see the downtime issues plus the asset sales actually get completed, I know you maybe haven't broken it down by all the segments, as you said, between the prices and all, but as we think about those projects that you're selling, dropping away, a resurgence in activity off the downtime as we kind of look at, say, the fourth quarter and then on into '14, what would you expect to see on the cash margin side, I mean, understanding that the next 2 quarters may be a little bit obscured in terms of what you're actually achieving? And maybe how much of it is an improvement of dropping off the projects you're exiting?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, so there's always so much -- there's always going to be a fair bit of volatility just based on what's going on with prices. So do you step -- you almost have to set that aside to start with. So if you think about what we said at our analyst presentation, we're kind of going from a mid-20s kind of cash margin today over the next several years where prices stay the same, that's kind of a low-30s type number. And that's being driven by new production coming online that's different. And new production has kind of happened on a favorably ratable basis over the next -- between now and 2017. You'll really start to see that happening for us kind of in the fourth quarter of this year as new projects start up and then also you're kind of ramping up on some of the Lower 48 assets as well. So it's going to be, if prices didn't change, then you'd see a fairly steady increase on our cash margins over that time frame, but I can't really tell you even how it's going to be in the second quarter or the third quarter. I think you were asking a question of, well, \"How about the impact of things dropping out of our portfolio?\" And you kind of are already -- seeing that already because we started reporting Algeria, Nigeria -- well, Kashagan didn't have any production right now, but we started reporting those assets as discontinued operations. So actually, having those sold, probably not going to change much from the presentation that you see today.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I guess that was part of my question, that -- so the $26.53 in Q1 is the right sort of run rate going forward?","Jeffrey Wayne Sheets","Yes, yes. Right.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as you think about Alaska, what would be the time frame in which you'd be able to reevaluate your existing projects or, let's say -- call, your inventory of projects and actually make it a decision going forward that we would maybe begin to think about Alaska as something other than a declining production province and something that could actually grow?","Matthew J. Fox","So Roger, we'll be doing that as we go through our planning process this summer and into the fall, in looking at how this change in the fiscal regime influences the competitiveness of the incremental projects that we can see there. And we'll put that in the mix. And I certainly expect to see us a onetime increase on investment in Alaska based of this change.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But if we think about budgeting this fall, given the time to get equipment up there and all, you'd really be looking at probably the winter of, I guess, '14, '15 to get more active?","Matthew J. Fox","In some areas, we can ramp up that quickly. That's pretty fast for somewhere like the north slope. But of course, if it's major projects and adding new phases of well site development or adding new drill sites and product or an NPR-A, these things take quite about longer than that and -- to get moving.","Operator","Our next question is from Iain Reid of Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Couple of things. A couple of questions about Australia, to begin with, if you don't mind. On Poseidon, you've drilled several wells there now and also farmed it down. I wonder if you can say how close you are now to getting into, say, feed and what you're thinking about in terms of a potential development. Is it going to be a stand-alone development, or maybe tied back to something else? Obviously, Woodside recently pushed their browsing back a little bit now. So that was the first thing. And the second thing is, on APLNG. You've been trying to farm this out for a while, trying to farm down further than your current interest. Is there any progress on that? Or did the -- or the appetite of people for Australian coal seam gas kind of diminished a little bit compared to where we were a couple of years ago? That was the first 2.","Matthew J. Fox","So -- okay, so let's take Poseidon first. So to answer the questions, you were asking, what's the right development plan there, where should we take the gas. That's the whole purpose of the appraisal program that's underway just now. And we anticipate the appraisal program will be somewhere between 5 and 8 wells. So we'll be appraising all the way through this year and probably into early year. And the whole purpose of the appraisal program is to get us the data that we need to optimize the development plan. So yes, that's what we're about in Poseidon. On APLNG, we have said that we would be interested in -- at the right value to dilute a bit further in APLNG. That's not likely to happen this year. So we're -- that's sort of in the back burner for the time being.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, last one is on the Chukchi. You've had to put that on hold for regulatory issues. What exactly are these issues? Isn't it knock on from what happened to Shell up there? And once you get drilling there, how do you kind of rank that region compared to other areas where you've been pretty successful recently, say, the Gulf of Mexico?","Matthew J. Fox","So in the Chukchi, the reason that we decided not to go out in there in 2014 was that we were in the cusp of having to make some very significant commitments for rigs, for vessels and so on. And we just felt as if there wasn't enough stability in the way that the regulatory framework was shaping up for us to be able to do that with confidence, knowing that we'd be able to get the permits and then go out there and actually drill when the rigs turned up. So we just felt that the prudent thing to do is to take a pause there and see how things -- see -- let things evolve a little bit before we decide to drill those wells. As far as the prospectivity is concerned, I mean, we still like the prospectivity in the Chukchi. There's a lot of potential out there. So we haven't given up on drilling in Chukchi. We just looked -- we said that we're not going to go out there in 2014.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you're looking at a 2015 program, then. Is that the kind of way to think about it?","Matthew J. Fox","Yes, potentially. We've been -- really, what we have to understand is what the -- is make sure that we fully understand the regulatory framework and so that we know what we're getting ready for and make sure that we can be ready for that.","Ellen R. DeSanctis","And Christine, we're right at top of the hour. I want to respect everybody's time. We're happy to take -- Vlad and I are happy to take any additional questions you might have.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine and thanks to our participants for your interest. We know it\u2019s a very busy day. On today\u2019s call Ryan Lance, our CEO and Chairman will provide a very brief overview of our strong operational performance for the quarter. Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer will then address the financial results for the quarter. And finally Matt Fox our EVP of E&P will cover the operational highlights and our production outlook for the rest of the year. Finally we\u2019ll turn the call over to you for Q&A. We would ask respectfully that you try to limit your questions to one plus a follow up and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.","We will make some forward-looking statements this morning and obviously the risks and uncertainties in our future performance are described in the Safe Harbor statements shown on slide two of today\u2019s presentation materials as well as in our periodic filings with the SEC. That\u2019s also available from our website along with our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations and supplemental data.","With that I\u2019m gone turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thank you Ellen and let me extent my thanks to all of you who also joined the call today and for your interest in the company. We\u2019re at the halfway mark in 2014 and I\u2019m pleased to say that our company\u2019s performance is progressing consistent with our plans this year. Top line growth and margin expansion are showing up in our performance and we\u2019re delivering on our commitments. The second quarter was certainly a volatile one geopolitically and there was a lot of sector activity on the domestic front, all of which we of course watch closely, but we continue to take what we believe is a sound long-term approach to the business. So we\u2019re staying the course and sticking to our plans. And our goal as we\u2019ve mentioned numerous times is to deliver predictable consistent performance and I think we achieved that again in the second quarter.","Operationally, the business ran very well. We produced 1.556 million BOE per day from continuing operations excluding Libya, which represented growth of 6.5% year-over-year. Now adjusted for downtime in Libya, we grew underlying volumes 4% this quarter compared to one year ago. And this performance exceeded our prior guidance, which Matt will cover a bit more detail in his comments. But our growth came from the several places notably the Eagle Ford and the Bakken but as well as recent startups in Europe, Asia Pacific and in oil sands. And the work continues to bring additional major projects online later this year and into 2015 and 2016.","Now if I switch financially, the quarter was also very strong. Adjusted earnings were $2 billion or $1.61 per share, that\u2019s up 14% year-over-year. Our cash flow from operations including the equity affiliate distributions funded our capital and dividend for the first half of the year. That leaves our cash position relatively unchanged from year-end 2013. And we\u2019re also seeing the visible margin growth and that should accelerate later in the year and into 2015 as our volumes continue to increase in high margin areas.","Now strategically while we\u2019re focused on our high value asset base that has a lot of running room, we\u2019re also looking to add organic options and choices through explorations. Today in addition to our unconventional and Gulf of Mexico exploration activities we\u2019re drilling in Senegal and Angola. Now these two areas have higher risk but also higher reward if successful. And we recently took a position in a large exploration concession offshore Nova Scotia. And yesterday we announced the completion of our sale of our Nigerian business. And that\u2019s a big milestone that completes the strategic divestiture program we announced two years ago. That program has generated nearly $14 billion of proceeds for our company. With these divestitures behind us we\u2019re now fully focused on executing our growth plans.","And finally earlier this month we approved a dividend increase of 5.8%. Giving back capital to our shareholders remains a tough priority and we believe an attractive dividend is the key part of our investment offering. Now that\u2019s kind of quick recap of the quarter. But let me just recap the key messages; the business is on track, we\u2019re delivering on our commitments and are building a strong momentum for the second half of the year and beyond.","So with those brief opening comments, now let me turn it over to Jeff for a financial review of the company.","Jeff Sheets","Thanks Ryan. I\u2019ll begin by reviewing the second quarter\u2019s results which are add on slide six. As you\u2019ll see it was a straightforward quarter overall. Production volumes exceeded guidance and the balance sheet remained strong. Looking at earnings, second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $2 billion or a $1.61 per diluted share, 14% above last year\u2019s second quarter. Second quarter earnings are shown in the chart in the lower right \u2013 segment earnings are shown the chart on the lower right. The financial details of each segment can be found in the supplemental data that accompany this morning\u2019s release but I\u2019ll highlight a few items for you.","The Lower 48 segment earnings this quarter largely reflected ongoing volume increases lead by Eagle Ford and Bakken which contributed to a 22% increase and Lower 48 liquids production year-over-year. This benefit was partially offset by wider differentials and $85 million of higher exploration expenses as a result of the Coronado Miocene appraisal well and Deep Nansen wildcat being deemed as non-commercial.","Canada continues to have a very solid year. This quarter\u2019s earnings reflected strong bitumen prices and steady production growth. Alaska performed in-line with expectations. Europe production benefited this quarter from continued major project ramp and better than planned turnaround activity. Sequentially earnings in Europe were negatively impacted by lift timing, increased maintenance cost and lower natural gas prices. Our Asia Pacific in the lease segments continues to perform well. Earnings this quarter benefited from some favorable lift timing versus the first quarter.","One quick note on our other international segment, effective this quarter we moved our Latin American and Poland operations into this other international segment. And our corporate segment results were also in line with guidance.","Lastly you\u2019ll see from our earnings release this morning that we have reaffirmed our prior guidance for capital DD&A in our corporate segment. Exploration expense guidance of $1.5 billion is also unchanged and includes risks dryhole expense. The outlook for production and SG&A cost is up modestly from our prior guidance to a range of $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion as compared to the original guidance of $8.5 billion.","If you will turn to slide seven I\u2019ll cover our production results for the quarter. As you know our convention for production is continued operations excluding Libya. On this basis, our second quarter averaged 1.556 million BOE per day which compares to 1.461 million per day in the second quarter of 2013. This is a headline increase of 95,000 BOE per day or 6.5%. 2.5% of this growth was due to lower downtime and the 4% or 60,000 BOE per day represents organic growth. This 60,000 BOE per day of growth was essentially all from increased liquids production with the largest source of growth being the Lower 48 unconventionals. Declines in North America gas production were offset by increases in international gas production.","I\u2019ll review margin growth next on slide eight. This slide shows changes in tax margins from second quarter 2013 to second quarter 2014 and also on a sequential basis. On the left side of the chart is the margins on an as-reported basis which were up 11% year-over-year. And are on the right our margins on a price-normalized basis. So on a price-normalized basis margins improved 2.4% year-over-year. Among the factors influencing margins in the second quarter were positive impacts from lower production in Libya and a positive impact from increased liquids production in the Lower 48 and adverse impacts from increased cost levels and wider differentials.","As we\u2019ve said previously this metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis but we expect margins to improve as we continue to shift production to higher value products and to places with more favorable fiscal terms. Once the heavy maintenance is completed in the third quarter we expect to see stronger underlying margin in the fourth quarter as higher margin volumes grow. And this set us well to achieve full year 3% to 5% margin growth in 2014.","Finally I\u2019ll review our cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year on the next slide. As Ryan mentioned we remained cash neutral over the first half of the year. We began with $6.5 billion of cash and short term investments. We generated $8.6 billion from operating activities and also added $1.3 billion from the SCCL distribution earlier in the year. With this we funded our capital program and dividend and ended the first half of the year with $6.4 billion in cash in short term investments.","The recent Nigeria closing will add net proceeds of approximately $900 million in the third quarter. Recall, approximately $550 million of the $1.4 billion of sales proceeds were already collected and included in our cash balance.","I\u2019ll wrap up the review of our financial performance by noting that we continue to have a strong balance sheet which gives us significant flexibility to execute on our investment plans.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.","Matt Fox","Thanks Jeff. As Ryan and Jeff already mentioned the business is running well and we are delivering on our organic growth goals. We exceeded our production guidance in the second quarter across several of our business segments, but particularly in the Lower 48. Some of this high performance is probably not repeatable and I\u2019ll explain that in a minute or so.","More importantly once we are through our annual turnaround activity in the third quarter we expect to accelerate our growth in the latter part of the year and that\u2019s going to position us for strong 2015 and beyond. So it\u2019s an exciting time for the business.","Please turn to slide 11 for an update on our Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48 second quarter production averaged 540,000 BOE per day. That\u2019s a 10% overall increase from the second quarter of last year and represents a 30% increase in crude oil production over the same period. Sequentially volumes grew 33,000 BOE per day or 7%. And the biggest contributors to growth in the quarter were the Eagle Ford and Bakken. The Eagle Ford grew 12% sequentially from an average of 140,000 BOE per day to 157,000. We experienced a strong second quarter as we brought on a higher than average number of wells in March, commissioned a number of compressor projects and experienced flush production coming from the recovery of first quarter weather impact.","The remainder of the 2014 will see a flatter production profile as we continue to move to multi well pad drilling that in the medium term slows down the number of new wells coming on production. But production from those wells will start to show up late this year and in to next year. The Bakken was up 19% from last quarter, averaging 51,000 BOE per day compared to 43,000 in the first quarter. This growth was helped by flush production and backlog reduction.","We expect to have multi pad drilling effects and we are anticipating winter weather impacts in the fourth quarter. So the rate of growth will slow in the second half of the year. The net effect of this is we are still on track to achieve our 2014 volume targets for both the Eagle Ford and Bakken but we do expect rates to flatten in third and fourth quarters and then begin to ramp up as we head in to 2015. Unconventional appraisal also continues in the Permian and the Niobrara. And we remain optimistic about these emerging plays. In addition to our unconventional activities appraisal continues this year in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico on all four of our significant discoveries, Shenandoah, Tiber, Gila and Coronado.","Our Canada business also performed very well operationally during the second quarter. We produced 284,000 of BOE per day which includes a 19% increase on liquids production year-over-year. In the oil sands Foster Creek Phase F is expected to start producing in the fourth quarter of this year and Surmont Phase 2 remains on schedule for flushing in mid-2015.","Our Western Canada program continues to deliver good returns with the large identified drilling inventory and we continue to explore and appraise our unconventional plays in the Duvernay and Montney. On the exploration front we acquired a 30% working interest and approximately 5 million gross acres off the Coast of Nova Scotia and drilling is expected to begin there in late 2015.","Next I\u2019ll cover our Alaska and Europe segments on slide 12. Alaska average production was a 193,000 BOE per day, in line with the expectations. At CD5 the Alpine Center facility \u2013 project has begun and fabrication is now underway. This project remains on track for start-up in late 2015. In the second quarter, we resumed export from our Kenai LNG plant in April and have already sold two cargos. We are also making good progress at our Drill Site 2S, [inaudible] one and 1H NEWS projects. 1H NEWS is the third new project we\u2019ve initiated since the passage of Alaska Production Act last spring.","On June 30, the AKLNG parties executed a joint venture agreement. In addition we have jointly applied for an export license from the Department of Energy. So we are making progress in the technical work to assess the feasibility of this project as a way to monetize the significant North Slope gas resource base. Finally, we recently executed a contract for a new build rig to begin drilling in 2016. One last point on Alaska as you probably know Alaskans will vote in August on whether or not to approve the More Alaska Production Act commonly known as SP21. And we certainly hope the legislation prevails. We believe it\u2019s important for continued oil and gas development in Alaska. We have identified and are actively developing opportunities for growth.","Moving on to Europe, second quarter production averaged 213,000 barrels a day up 23% year-over-year, reflecting major projects start ups, Eldfisk II, sail, Jasmine and EIS as well as lower downtime than in the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter of this year we completed our J-Area turnaround work ahead of schedule and brought online the J-12 exploration well. The Britannia Long-Term Compression project is on track to start up later this quarter. Sail away and installation of the topsides was completed to Eldfisk II and the project remains on schedule for early 2015 start-up. With significant turnarounds underway in the UK this quarter this will impact third quarter volumes as we expected but overall the Europe segment is operating well and remains on schedule to deliver on its growth commitments.","Now let\u2019s review our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment and our other international segments on slide 13. In APME we produced 323,000 BOE per day in the second quarter roughly flat with last year. But the segment remains positioned for high margin growth in the second half of the year and in to 2015. Our partner operated Gumusut project is progressing towards first oil late in the third quarter. In June topside sailed away for our Kebabangan project and was successfully installed and we remain on track for first production there in the fourth quarter.","At APLNG the first [conderbrie] gas processing facility started up this quarter and that was an important milestone for the upstream project. On a combined downstream and upstream basis this project is now about 75% completed and remains on schedule for a mid-2015 start up. Finally, we continue to evaluating opportunities with ongoing appraisal offshore in Australia, at Poseidon and Barossa. In our other international segment the key 2014 activities are exploration related. Currently we\u2019re drilling the [Camosh] well in Block 36 in Angola and the [FAN] well in Senegal. We expect to have some initial drilling results in these wells later in the year.","In Poland we recently safely completed a 25 stage 7.5 million pound hydraulics stimulation of the [Loblewo] well and will short list the well on an expanded floor test. And in Colombia we expect to begin exploration drilling in the La Luna Shale later this year.","Our volume outlook is shown on slide 14. So this is our typical chart of quarterly volume guidance for continuing operations excluding Libya. The first and second quarter represent actuals and the third and fourth quarter show our expected ranges which are unchanged from prior guidance. However, our full year range has narrowed and the midpoint has increased to reflect a strong operational performance year-to-date.","As expected third quarter production dropped primarily due to customer planned downtime and this year the key area for schedule turnarounds include Alaska, Canada, the UK and [inaudible] Importantly the \u2013 shutdown will take about 36 days will include brownfield activity for the tie-in of two new subsea wells that should come on in 2015. We expect to achieve a strong finish to the year with an exit rate of over 1.6 million BOE per day. By the fourth quarter our turnaround should be complete and several additional incremental projects should come online in the UK, Malaysia and oil sands. In addition to these we should have ramped gas sales to QC LNG in Australia which are scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter.","The bottom line is we expected to deliver 3% to 5% production growth this year with strong momentum going into 2015. So this concludes my comments and I\u2019ll turn back to Ryan for closing remarks.","Ryan Lance","Thank you, Matt. So our story this quarter is really no difference than our previous several quarters. We\u2019re focused on delivering our stated goals of 3% to 5% volume and margin growth while returning capital to our shareholders through an attractive dividend. Our capital plans are on track, cash flow neutrality is getting closer and we continue to create options and choices to sustain our long term success. So we\u2019re following the plan and the path that we laid out over two years ago and it\u2019s working.","So with those comments I\u2019ll turn it over back to the operator and we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks everybody. If I could start with one on the U.S. Onshore I appreciate the clarity on the trajectory over the second half of the year. But I guess if we look at the Eagle Ford and the Bakken I know you\u2019re quite active in both in both spacing pilots and then the Eagle Ford as well, with the upper Eagle Ford there, can you \u2013 any the comments and what you seen so far and what the trends are in that direction?","Matt Fox","So we\u2019re still executing those pilot tests and we announced earlier this year that we had enough evidence accumulated to go to an atrophical and 80 acre high low development lower part of the Eagle Ford. So we\u2019re implementing that now. And we\u2019re continuing the pilot pass looking at the upper Eagle Ford and looking at tighter spacing there. And the same comments really apply in the Bakken we\u2019re still looking at the opportunities to tighten up well spacing and other layers but there\u2019s nothing really new to report there, Ryan this quarter.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks. And then if I could maybe one follow up on the cash margin trends I mean there was a slight tick and I realize this is on quarter basis it\u2019s pretty dangerous but in slight down tick 2Q where there mix issues, can we think about \u2013 I guess how mix shift affected us, was that a result of some of cost increases that we saw in the quarter and looking forward over the rest of the year with the heavy turnaround schedule in 3Q, how would you expect trends to go?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, I think you have the correct observations there, Ryan. The mix shift continues to be a pretty substantial positive for our cash margins. And what we saw this quarter is that was offset somewhat by wider differentials that we saw across our portfolio.","Ryan Lance","When we look at cash margins we do price normalization based on how much market prices have moved and when we don\u2019t see the same kind of movement in realized prices that we saw in market prices that has adverse impacts on cash margins and that was the case this quarter, when we saw some wider differentials across the portfolio.","And we did see some level of higher cost as well but mix shift is still long term what\u2019s driving higher cash margins. We\u2019re going to continue to see that trend develop. I think your observation and maybe this can be volatile from quarter to quarter is something that we\u2019re going to continue emphasize. But if you look over the whole year as we mentioned earlier, we are on track to be in 3% to 5 % margin gross range on a price normalized basis.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s good. Ryan, your comments on the cost increase side, on the cost \u2013 was some of that driven by just the fact that you guys have raised production guidance a little bit with higher production has brought some little bit higher cost or was it all inflation?","Ryan Lance","There is a bit of both of those and if you think about what we\u2019ve done with cost guidance overall. We started the year with a cost guidance of $8.5 billion. That compares to a number that was more like about 8.25 or so last year. So we increased our cost about equivalent to what we\u2019re projecting production growth. And we\u2019re refining a little bit higher production growth and just a little bit higher cost than what we\u2019ve seen before but not any one particular item that we can point to on cost but cost are generally a couple of percent higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, I appreciate that. I leave it there.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious. Some of your peers in the Eagle Ford have applied and received permits for exporting condensate and I am curious if you can comment as to whether for one you have applied for a similar permit and if not, do you think that would be something that could benefit your realizations in the basin?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. Thanks, Blake. We\u2019re aware of what a lot of people are doing on the export. We\u2019ve been out pretty publicly as a company supporting and advocating on the half of not only the condensate exports but the crude oil export is well which we think the condensate solves a very, very small problem. The larger issue we are having in North America is growing light oil production and the feasibility or the capacity being used up in the refining sector to really absorb that creating some of the differential issues that Jeff talked about and we have been facing back. But we follow it pretty closely. Right now we\u2019re getting most of our condensate to the Gulf Coast putting it on ships and getting it around. We don\u2019t see the \u2013 back but we certainly we watch it pretty closely and if we think there is an advantage to doing that we\u2019d be in talking with the Department of Commerce as well.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, great. Second question, this is probably a long shot but in the past you had used proceeds from asset divestitures to buy back stock fully appreciate that you are kind of past that program. But at least looking first half of the year you\u2019re technically cash flow neutral and I am just curious if there would be any consideration to maybe use these proceeds to buy back some additional stock?","Ryan Lance","Yeah. No, thanks Blake. I appreciate it. I think as I said before we are kind of executing the plan we laid out and that plan from a couple of years ago we knew we would be in a little bit shorter cash flow neutrality but we grow into that by 2016. So we\u2019re really using the cash on the balance sheet to fund the programs that we\u2019ve got. We made those assumptions of modest commodity prices as commodity prices has maybe been a little bit higher than our expectation it\u2019s freed up little bit cash but it\u2019s really gone to our investment program and into the extent we fully fund all of our high quality investment programs we will consider share buyback at that point in time. But right now it\u2019s being used to fund our dividend and our capital program.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Thank you Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi everyone. Could you talk \u2013 hey guys \u2013 your CapEx is high relative to the $16 billion you have guided it to on an annual run-rate could you talk about whether you attempted to spend a little more given things going for the wells you and I particularly I noticed the exploration expense is up so, whether or not that that you may be spending a bit more on exploration given that as I said things are going well. Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","So our CapEx for the year is running pretty much on track with our guidance. We have guided to $16.7 billion for the year and we are I think we are $8.1 billion though half of the year so, little bit less than the CapEx base. We think we are on pace for about $16.7 billion for the year on capital.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Are you going to keep that flat going forward? It was \u2013 I mean I am still working I guess back on the old number $16 billion is the run rate that we were working towards when you started the\u2026","Jeff Sheets","Yeah, as we talked about at our analyst presentation in April I think we see capital in kind of $16.5 billion to $17 billion range for the next few years.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yeah, I think that what I am trying to drive at is really the exploration program and whether or not you are happy with how much is being spent there and whether or not you would spending more?","Ryan Lance","Yeah, I would say Paul we are taking advantage of some opportunities. We talked about Nova Scotia we are drilling now in Angola and Senegal both. I kind view sort of the capital the $16 billion that we have talked is kind of running this year at about $16.7 billion as we said earlier at the Analyst Meeting but that\u2019s looking at opportunities that we have in the portfolio and some of the extra cash we are getting from the higher commodity prices and deploying that in the places we think are adding value both in a little bit faster pace in the Eagle Ford Bakken and some of the exploration that we are doing around the world.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yeah, and that\u2019s Gulf of Mexico?","Matt Fox Yeah, so we have an appraised program going there Paul in all of their existing discoveries and that\u2019s what dominates our exploration capital for this in the Gulf of Mexico.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, I get it. I\u2019m just trying to really focus on the idea that we want to keep capital down but I understand that particularly in the [Guam] that was potential to spend more on an outright exploration. You kind of successfully close the \u2013 keeping on cash flow you successfully lose the Nigeria deal which I think was pretty much last one if I am not wrong of the previous program. Is there potential for you to further improve the cash balances by more \u2013 another around of major disposal. Thanks and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Ryan Lance","Yeah, no, I think yeah, in terms of the announced sort of large disposition plans Nigeria really completes that what we talked about when we spun the company a couple of years ago. As I tell people we continue to look at the portfolio and quite a high grade it is, opportunities present themselves and we will continue to look at that. But I don\u2019t see another major capital disposition program or announcement that you see coming us but we will be constantly looking at trying the high grade portfolio and clean up the bottom end and focus all of our investments in the top end of the portfolio. That really is really is driving the growth and the higher margins and the returns.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning everybody.","Ryan Lance","Good morning Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","In Australia it appears that exploration or maybe appraisal success has continued recently near the [inaudible] Discovery which I think Matt might have alluded to and on this point I want to see if there are any updates there and also where the one type of development is more likely then another meaning is this hopefully going to eventually feed the LNG facility nearby. So just a general update on that situation is what we are after?","Matt Fox","Okay, thanks Doug. We are getting close to completing our appraisal program in the Poseidium complex and we designed that program to give the information us that need to do exactly what you are Doug to make sure that we are optimizing the development plan for Poseidium and we have the same goal in mind on the exploration that we just commenced in the Barossa area. So basically this appraised activity is designed to establish of course the best backfill opportunity for the Duvernay LNG plant for example.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thanks a lot.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Just actually a quick forward on Australia, I mean how much gas do you think you\u2019d be able to get over and above APLNG from sort of sales to other project there, I think you mention QCLNG gas any sort of rough order magnitude?","Ryan Lance","Well I mean it depends very much when these projects \u2013 I mean we don\u2019t tend to take the opportunity to sell [ramped] gas to those projects but the exact magnitude of that will be dependent upon the timing of those stack ups relative to our stack-up. So it\u2019s hard to put a number on that just now. But we have the capacity available to provide those ramp gas sales when the opportunity arises.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, I am going to get to something more closer to whom but any progress on Venezuela or timing around that?","Ryan Lance","Yeah, on Venezuela we are in discussions with the Tribunal both sides, ourselves and the Venezuelans are now putting in their damages assessment and putting forward their \u2013 our positions with respect to the damages that were created from the Tribunals earlier award indicating that we unlawfully expropriated by the Venezuelans. So that award is also \u2013 we are in the process now of our damage assessments on both sides and we are saying that probably takes about a year to go through that process. It started a few months ago that\u2019s kind of time line that we are operating under.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, and then moving back in the U.S. I mean let\u2019s just talk briefly about Permian. I think in your Analyst Day slides you were testing an area over in the Delaware and then sort of Southern Midland and I think you gave numbers I think it was 150 million acres in the Delaware and I think just under 100 in the Midland. So first question are those the total acreages that you have in those two shale basins or is it just those sort of areas that you are testing and then maybe give us some color about the recent well results and your rig plans for those two basins as we go forward and then I have quick follow-on.","Matt Fox","Okay, those numbers that you quoted, the 150 and 90 doesn\u2019t [inaudible] for the Delaware and the Permian. Those really represent the acreage of where we are looking at unconventional development over a million acres in the Permian as a whole. But those are really representative of the areas where we are focusing on unconventional and exploration appraisal. Right now we have four rigs running and they all focus just now on the Delaware Basin. We have well repairs underway from the wells that were previously drilled in the Midland basin but we do drilling activity there right now. So that\u2019s really \u2013 and what we are doing is basically testing the whole section as we describe at the Analyst Day there is about 4,500 feet of prospective section within the Permian Basin and certainly in the Delaware and we are going through the process of making sure that we explore and appraise those different horizons and so we get a clear understanding of what the development plans should be for that going forward.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And are they mainly \u2013 is that mainly lease acreage with royalties or is this some fee acreage mixed in that from legacy production in terms of wells position?","Matt Fox","The areas that we are focused on for unconventionals are predominantly leased acreage.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right, okay, thanks very much.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Ed.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hi, guys.","Ryan Lance","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","On Venezuela there is markets rumor that [FICO] maybe selling their refinery. Wondering have you checked with your legal advisor whether you guys \u2013 in the event that they go forward can you put an injunction on that to sort of force Venezuela to speed up their settlement?","Ryan Lance","You know it\u2019s probably not appropriate for us to comment on tactics that we might take in that regard Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Or that maybe as a \u2013 for Ryan, the North American crude differential market look like it\u2019s continued extremely volatile and is still not 100% clear that when or if the government is going to allow the export of crude \u2013 on I know that it\u2019s only two years ago that you spin off the refining. Have you ever thought about to recreate an integrated operation or this is totally behind and you guys not consider given that look like there is pretty large refining system may be available in the market now?","Ryan Lance","Yeah, that\u2019s a bit of a curve ball Paul I will give you that. Right now we are pretty much focused on our plans as an independent E&P company. So we\u2019re pretty focused on trying to grow our production, grow our margins as we\u2019ve outlined and be one of best E&P companies in the space today and part of that does \u2013 we have a large North American position certainly with the Eagle Ford, Bakken and the unconventional at our legacy position in the North America. So the export issues something that\u2019s pretty important to us and we\u2019re spending quite a bit of time advocating on behalf of that back in both on the Hill and with the administration.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And the final question, first can you share with us any preliminary CapEx and production estimate for 2015?","Ryan Lance","Well I think we\u2019re in the middle of putting our plans together but what I want to take us back to the analyst presentation that we did back in April and our plans really are unchanged from what we described to you guys back then, both capital and production.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And maybe this is for Matt, Matt if I look at you indicated that third quarter with downtime from \u2013 and maybe that\u2019s some third party operation that the startup maybe a little bit delayed. If you look at of your standpoint what is the biggest risk for you to achieve as your production target or that planned target for the next six to 18 months, is there any major project that you think is a little bit more concern or any particular area on the supply chain or anything?","Matt Fox","I think the range that we\u2019ve given for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter captures the uncertainty that we see in the overall portfolio and the third quarter there was a bit uncertainty on the duration of some of our downtime and the fourth quarter is dominated more by the timing of the new projects coming on. One of the advantages that we have as a diversified company is that no individual \u2013 no single project is going to make a big difference in the overall scheme of things and that diversification in the portfolio helps us to limit the exposure to individual projects prices. So I think the range that we\u2019ve given from third and fourth quarters is \u2013 captures all of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Harlan of Society Generale. Please go ahead.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah three unrelated questions hopefully not strain your consciousness. With APLNG if you get approval how long would it take to really develop it? I know it\u2019s beyond the scope of an investor call but I\u2019m just curious?","Matt Fox","Well we made a lot of progress in APLNG this year I mentioned that we\u2019ve signed a joint venture agreement and applied for the export to FTA and non-FTA countries. So we\u2019re starting \u2013 and that will taking 12 to 18 months or so. And then feed would then take two, or three years so that\u2019s our final investment decision would be in 2017, 2016-2017 timeframe and first production would be in 2022 to 2025. So that\u2019s a sort of timeline that we\u2019re looking at, John.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay thanks Matt. With respect to Paul and Matt, did you want a core on the well you\u2019re now testing and if so how did the rocks compare to say gas shales in the U.S.?","Matt Fox","So we didn\u2019t go to horizontal section but we do have crude information from the vertical wells that we have are drilled there. And it\u2019s difficult to tell there\u2019s a good looking section that we\u2019ve drilled the horizontal well and as you know until you actually frac and produce these unconventional reservoirs it\u2019s difficult to know what you\u2019re going. So we do not \u2013 we have already the usual data it looked like in the U.S. and the frac that we\u2019ve just done on this well is basically an Eagle Ford style frac and so we\u2019re getting our best shot and we\u2019ll get sense of whether or not what sort of rates we can achieve but and we get to the end of the yield this year.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay great. Last one from me, as regarding your deepwater exploration in Angola and Senegal, you\u2019re going to be releasing well result individually or just on the quarterly call?","Ryan Lance","I suspect that certainly in Senegal we have some smaller companies involved they\u2019ll be releasing information about \u2013 on a regular basis and on the Angola well I don\u2019t know unless we win sea \u2013 so far things go but we remain get some information in advance of the quarterly call, we see another calls.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","All right thanks very much.","Ryan Lance","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for getting on guys. I want to just follow up on Paul\u2019s question about the front loaded CapEx or what seems to be front loaded CapEx this year and Eagle Ford is specifically not you talked about more completions in the second quarter can you just give us an idea on what the pace has been relative to \u2013 I think it was like a 190 wells you were planning for the year originally. Are you running ahead of that, or is that\u2019s still a good number and how much of that we grew so far and then I\u2019ve got a follow up please.","Ryan Lance","Yeah so that\u2019s a good number so \u2013 a quarter that we\u2019re working through and that place has been very consistent in terms of getting again the wells drilled. As you know as we move to pad drilling there tends to be more batch lake as the production comes on in terms of executing the number of wells we\u2019re drilling we\u2019re on pace for data around a 190 or so that we thought we would be for this year.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So second quarter I thought in your prepared remarks you had few more wells come on, so was it less in the Q1 or more in Q2 or just want to understand the pace that you see there?","Matt Fox","So a bunch of wells come on rate at the beginning of the quarter which meant that those wells were in production all the way through the quarter. That was one of the reasons the quarter was higher production than we expected. But overall from pace perspective it\u2019s much same from a drilling piece from a completion and bringing on production that perspective that of course is influenced by the batch drilling associated with the pads and that\u2019s what I was trying to indicate in the prepared remarks that\u2019s going to be a bit more lumpy than it has been in the past because of the pad drilling.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. My follow up is a bit more conceptual I think it straddles a number of issues, asset monetization amongst them but mindful of Brian\u2019s commentary, when you look at some of your peers Devon Energy for example with their handling situation and what they are doing there, now going go to Midstream MLP how do you guys think about your midstream infrastructure spending because obviously it\u2019s a big enabler as you guys know I\u2019ve been trying to reconcile the level of spending in Eagle Ford relative to the activity and I\u2019m guessing mid-stream\u2019s a big part of that. So how do you think about how you might be able to perhaps more efficiently monetize your midstream given the high level of CapEx and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","If you look at our midstream position overall Doug going back in history most of that midstream position went into the DCP joint venture which has since gone with 466. So there are not a lot of midstream assets that are out there that could form the core of an MLP for us. As we look \u2013 as we go forward we\u2019re having some midstream investments in the Eagle Ford and in the Permian, but those are really not of the size that we feel like we have the critical mass to be thinking about an MLP but that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll just continue to evaluate as we go through time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reid of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi good morning. Nearly had a \u2013 anyway. I guess a quick question for you getting back to the Lower 48 we\u2019re seeing I guess two pronged question one is your gas production only down slightly here on a year-over-year basis after declining fairly aggressively for the last several quarters or years is that something now that we see the size of your shale play associated gas enough to gas production itself its ongoing down I think of that as consistent with what we\u2019ve seen across the broader industry but I was hoping for some clarity on that.","Matt Fox","Yeah gas production in a broad sense is going to remain roughly flat in Lower 48, we\u2019re not drilling any wells dedicated to dry gas but we have then associated gas production with Eagle Ford and Bakken for example, such that on a broad basis we\u2019re going to be relatively flat in overall gas product probably for the next several years.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","And the follow up to that we\u2019ve seen one company very large one in the space to swap of one type of likely very gassy assets for stuff from the Permian is that something with an overall I want to call you are CapEx constraint but let\u2019s say at least capped level of CapEx that you would be interested in pursuing. I mean now the big asset sales are essentially down with Nigeria but I was wondering if that\u2019s maybe something a little bit more imaginative side that you\u2019d be willing to pursue here?","Jeff Sheets","Yeah I mean that it really then goes a long way for Ryan we\u2019ve seen at or about I mean on an opportunistic basis the things like swaps and of underlying assets may make sense to this. So we\u2019re always open to consider those sort of things for this. But it\u2019s not big part of our ongoing plans.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","And if you were to look at more acreage in either the Permian or the Niobrara given your efforts that are ongoing right now, is that how we should think of the funding or is it that\u2019s a future unallocated CapEx in \u201815, \u201816, or \u201817.","Matt Fox","And then the plans that we\u2019ve laid out for $16 billion of capital, we\u2019re including in there the fact that we intend to be develop our overall unconventional resource base including the Permian and the Niobrara.","Ryan Lance","And that includes Roger some lease acquisitions money as well. So we\u2019re in the market every day, every week in these areas trying to build our positions and core output we think are good deals.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay appreciate it. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Hey folks thanks for taking the questions. I just want to look ahead a little bit. As you guys are absorbing the result of the non-op US Gulf of Mexico program that you guys have been participating in the last couple of years. Can you speak just a little bit about what looks interesting to you as you contemplate launching the operated program next year?","Ryan Lance","Yeah primary focus on the Gulf of Mexico has been and will continue to be the [paleongene]. We do have some interest in Miocene prospects that we will drill we get are operated and rigs available. But I would say that the primary focus going forward will be in Paleocene and we\u2019ve had a lot of success there as you\u2019ve seen with the four five significant discoveries. And we\u2019ll go back to over 2 million acres of deepwater position there. And it\u2019s about 70% to 80% Paleocene focused but we do have some insights in the Miocene opportunities as well.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay great. The other thing I want to talk about quickly on the onshore obviously you guys have commented generally about the programs in the Permian and Niobrara but just looking at Niobrara and I know that you probably don\u2019t have much you can say about the anti-fracking measures on the balance but in terms of handicapping that, but has that effected your activity levels there, are you guys thinking about ratcheting back whatever your plan was in the second half of \u201814 as you think about risking likelihood of some type of negative outcome over there.","Ryan Lance","It hasn\u2019t effected of execution of our plans change. We\u2019ll just have to see if that those dollars actually make it to the \u2013 or not and then we\u2019ll adjust the plans if we need to be some of those results there.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay but no kind of proactive stuffs. If I could sneak one more in I know you guys are doing a stratigraphic well in the La Luna in Columbia on shore this year. I wondered if you guys or couple of other operators are picked up bigger offshore pieces in the license surrounds that they run out there and they\u2019re also and they\u2019ve talked about the targeting the Lumina offshore. Have you guys looked at that or would you consider that?","Matt Fox","Right now we are focused on the onshore position that will good position which we believe in the La Luna and you\u2019re absolutely right the first well the \u2013 this year will be a stratigraphic test to calibrate the geology the thermal maturity and so on. So at least as because I we\u2019re not looking that offshore for the unconventionals around Columbia.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks for taking the question. I realized this is less than 1% of your portfolio but can help asking about the polar light with Rosneft in the context of the new sanctions. Any color on how that might affect the business.","Matt Fox","Yeah Pavel as you know we\u2019ve pretty much exited Russia with some of the moves that we\u2019ve made as a company over the last two to three years. And right now we\u2019re in a process work we\u2019re actually marketing our \u2013 line interest. So that\u2019s hopefully coming to some sense of conclusion over the course of this year.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, fair enough. You think that sanctions will influence the marketing process or any sign of that.","Ryan Lance","Well it hasn\u2019t today but we watch it I mean we obviously watch it pretty closely if the latest around the sanctions got ratcheted up a little bit more significantly both on the European and the US side. Today it hasn\u2019t impacted it but again we\u2019re watching it closely but as you indicated pretty small portion of the portfolio, it\u2019s not a lot of proceeds that. What I put in the kind of the portfolio cleanup category right now that not leveraging but some just we need to cleanup in our portfolio.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Understood. And then on LNG I realized it\u2019s still about a year before start up. But do you have a sense of how long it\u2019s likely to take before it reaches full nameplate.","Ryan Lance","We have the \u2013 as you know we have two trains there Pavel. The first one will come up in the around the middle of next year. The second train will six and nine months later than that. And we should get to full capacity relatively quickly. We have the resource base that we need. We have the wells and facilities being developed that we need to do that. So we should get to full capacity hopefully by the middle of \u201816.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay at both trains?","Ryan Lance","Yes.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Got it okay. Thanks very much guys.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Pavel.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Scott [Hanold] of RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here. You obviously discuss a little bit of a midstream monetization opportunities. Can you discuss little bit on like mineral interest ownership you only have. I mean Anadarko obviously came out and discussed some stuff that they had it\u2019s a looks like there is potentially some value here. Do you guys have something similar?","Ryan Lance","We\u2019ve got a big Lower 48 Western Canadian Gas portfolio. So we do have assets where we have royalty interest and overwriting royalty positions. These are potions which provide us with revenue and really high margin production without any kind of corresponding operating expense or capital requirements. And we think these like we really think of other assets in our portfolios as we\u2019re always thinking about whether what we could sale them for and get on an after tax basis is more or less than our hold value. One of things you got a think about an interest like this as we have pretty low tax bases in these types of assets, and that\u2019s will gone be a real consideration. So we\u2019re going \u2013 we\u2019re just continue to monitor the asset market for something like in evaluated see if it\u2019s kind a applicability for us in the future.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay could you give us a sense of how big that ownership is and what the revenues are roughly on an annual basis?","Ryan Lance","We really think it\u2019s probably more appropriate that we do something like that if we get serious about doing a transaction like this.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay understood. And my second question is on Jasmine, I guess one of your partners discussed some compartmentalization and some performance, not to expectations. Can you give us a little bit of color on that and what you all thinks you can do here.","Matt Fox","Jasmine the production performance has been a bit below what we anticipated it would be because of a bit more reservoir complexity. It\u2019s within the range of our expectations but at the lower end of the range. In fact as we\u2019re drilling the Jasmine development wells we actually now believe that there is more gas in place, gas and condensate in place in Jasmine than we thought. But it\u2019s a bit more stratigraphically complex. So we\u2019re evaluating that just now and because we knew that there were some uncertainty we actually installed the platform at Jasmine that has 24 slots on it. And our initial plans were only to drill eight wells from it. So there is a lot of flexibility for us to add production and overcome this reservoir heterogeneity issue as time goes on.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Yeah, can you give us a sense on what kind on incremental CapEx spend it would take to kind of get it back to say the midpoint of that range of expectations.","Ryan Lance","Now it\u2019s really too early to see where we\u2019re digesting in those out from our production performance to date. And we\u2019ll build to our plans as we get a better understanding of the reservoir dynamics.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay understood. Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ellen DeSanctis Vice President Investor Relations and Communications.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine thanks everybody.

And welcome to the ConocoPhillips Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Zanera and I'll be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Zanera. Hello to our listeners and welcome to today's call. With me in the room today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO. Don Wallette, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Fox, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Bullock, our President of the Asia-Pacific, Middle East region. And Michael Hatfield the President of our Alaska Canada and Europe region are also with us today. Dominic Macklon, President of our Lower 48 region was unable to join today's call.","Page 2 of the presentation deck contains our cautionary statement. We will make some forward-looking statements during this morning's call. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide and also in our periodic filings with the SEC. We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website. And with that I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan.","Ryan Lance","Thanks Ellen and welcome again to all our listeners. While it's early in the New Year and the sector is already off to another volatile start. Volatility can certainly be tough on an industry or company if you're not built for it. Well, we're built for it. With clear resilience to lower prices, full upside to higher prices and a shareholder friendly framework that works through the cycles.","All of our usual results and outlook details can be found in today's published materials, but we're going to keep our prepared remarks pretty short. Our main goal is to reinforce why ConocoPhillips offers an attractive way to invest in a cyclical business, that's the key theme as we reflect on 2019. And we look forward to the future.","2019 capped off a successful 3-year period in which we transformed our business model and significantly improve the underlying performance drivers across our entire business.","Slide 3 summarizes those 2019 results that contributed to this transformation. In the financial column, we delivered strong earnings and we generated cash from operations of $11.7 billion, delivering free cash flow of over $5 billion. Our balance sheet got stronger. We ended 2019 with over $8 billion of cash in short-term investments and lowered our asset retirement obligation by almost 30% largely due to dispositions.","At our North Star return on capital employed was an 11%. We delivered on our volume projections for the year with roughly 5% underlying growth, including 22% growth from the Big 3 unconventionals, the rest of our portfolio delivered strong base performance and we progressed new projects and exploration opportunities across our regions.","Our world-class portfolio keeps getting better as part of our high grading efforts we generated over $3 billion of disposition proceeds and we have another $2 billion have announced dispositions that we expect to close in early 2020. But we're not just selling. We're also on the lookout for opportunities to add low cost of supply resources through the portfolio like we did last year in the Lower 48, Alaska and internationally. And when reserves closed for the year, we replaced 117% of our production organically. 2019 was another outstanding year for delivering on our disciplined shareholder friendly strategy.","We returned 43% of our CFO to our shareholders. That's essentially all of our free cash flow. We paid $1.5 billion in dividends, including a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend and we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares.","In today's announcement, you saw our Board approved an increase of our existing repurchase authorization by $10 billion to a total of $25 billion. This demonstrates our commitment to executing a consistent long-term buyback program. Finally, our execution focus goes beyond just the numbers. We continue to take a leadership role in environmental, social and governance matters through target setting, engagement, disclosure advocacy and stakeholder alignment.","We call this performance with purpose and it's an imperative. So 2019 is over and we're in the starting gates for New Year and a new decade. In November, we laid out a powerful 10-year plan that can deliver on all the elements; we believe investors want from this sector. A disciplined strategy framework, consistent execution, strong free cash flow and compelling returns of and returns on capital. That's the path we set for ourselves in 2016. That's what we delivered in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And that's what we're ready to do again in 2020.","We're focused on executing a strategy that we believe is right for the future of our industry and certainly right for ConocoPhillips and our investors. So with that let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","DougLeggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate the opportunity for a lengthy Q&A session. So I've just got a couple. And now let someone else jump on. I guess first of all, there is a number of headlines have been circulating for quite a while now around the Alaska tax and that's obviously a little different from the last time you presented through this back in November. So I'm just wondering if you can offer your perspectives. Just how you think, what do you think is going on there and how do you think that plays out whether they get the signatures and what the implications could be as to how you respond to that.","And my second one is really on the production outlook for 2020. Obviously, the Malaysia pipeline issue appears to be back on the table again. So I'm just wondering if you could walk us through the cadence of how we should expect production to evolve through the year. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","MichaelHatfield","Yes. Thanks, Doug, this is Michael. I'll answer the first question about the Alaska tax. So you asked where we are in this process. The division of elections in Alaska is currently certified signatures now. They were gathered as part of the initiative for this November ballot. We anticipate that the initiatives be part of the balance. So they are in the process of certifying those now.","And as we showed in November, we're currently planning to invest about $25 billion of capital over the next 10 years in Alaska. These investments will increase the state's production and mitigate the current decline through tax. In fact, in 2020 alone our net capital and OpEx spend in Alaska is expected to be roughly $3.4 billion. On a gross basis in 2020, total industry capital and OpEx spend in Alaska is expected to be about $6 billion.","Now, if there is a negative change in this fiscal regime. Our investment plans will change, but we've been in Alaska for over 40 years. We know Alaskans understand the industry. It\u2019s the lifeblood of the state's economy; we believe Alaskans will understand that short-term revenue gain as a risky and fleeting proposition, if it comes at the cost of billions of dollars of investment over the coming years.","We've had ballot measure challenges over the past few years that would have negatively impacted our business and Alaska's economy. After understanding the issues Alaska voters that voted no on all of them. Now we're part of an industry group that will provide information of voters about the benefits of the current fiscal regime, the benefits that it has on jobs, investment, oil production and long-term revenue to the state.","So the bottom line is we're working hard to ensure Alaskans understand the significant benefits that investment by this industry brings to the people and the state of Alaska under the current fiscal structure.","DougLeggate","So as things stand right now, no change in your current plans, more of a wait and see type situation.","MichaelHatfield","That's correct. So in terms of our current plans, we're waiting to see. We're executing on our current plans, but we are gearing up to help Alaskans understand our view as benefits at the current fiscal structure brings to the state and the people.","DougLeggate","Okay, thank you for that. And on the production cadence.","MattFox","Hey, Doug, this is Matt. The - I can give you an update on that the - so the most significant update in our production guidance, as you mentioned was associated with the KBB production in Malaysia. And as you know most of KBBs gas is sold through the third party Sabah-Sarawak pipeline to the Malaysia LNG plant and its exported from that plant.","So a normal operating condition for 2020 we weren\u2019t even have anticipated about 20,000 barrels a day being exported through MLNG via the Sabah-Sarawak pipeline, but the rate at the beginning of the year, there was a significant operational issue with the pipeline. The - so our expectation for the year, given that we don't operate that, our expectation is that might not be repeated at all through the year. So that's what we're assuming at the moment. That we're hopeful we might get access to some domestic gas off-take, but the magnitude of that and how long it might last is uncertain. So that's the vast majority of the adjustment to guidance. We also had some puts and takes across the business units. And we also adjusted our expectation for timing of dispositions. But the new range of 1220 to 1270 are best guess at the moment and what we should expect for this year and that's about a4% growth on an underlying basis.","DougLeggate","Okay. I don't want to press the topic, but are there any particular dips in the quarterly cadence as we go through the year.","MattFox","Well, we obviously we have a turnaround as we go into the middle of the year. We have one in the first quarter in Qatar. And then we have, as usual turnarounds in the Alaska and elsewhere as we go through the second and third quarter. So a similar profile to previous years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.","DouglasTerreson","Good morning, everybody. So, Ryan, you guys are one of the few, if not the only big or other E&P with higher rather than lower normalized returns on capital in recent years and while your stock has been a top five performer and S&P Energy 3 years in a row for this reason, in my view, your cash position is building a strong, you have better valuation in your equity than lot of peers and so you're basically better positioned than your peers for strategic activity. At the same time, you guys outlined a pretty compelling multiyear investment plan in November, which suggested that you can attain your return profile even without meaningful strategic action. So, my question is with the ongoing decline in upstream values that we've seen in public and private E&P, one, have strategic actions become more appealing to you guys? Are they more compelling and what effect on return on capital employed is needed for you guys to move forward in this area? So two questions.","RyanLance","Well, thanks, Doug. Yes, I think we believe we are on the right track with what we're doing in terms of what you describe our return profile focused on shareholder distributions, focused on free cash flow generation in a hyper-focused on our return on capital employed. As I said 2019 was 11% that is our guiding North Star As we think about how we're executing the business. We have built a little bit of cash on the balance sheet, we believe we needed for the volatility, we're experiencing in the marketplace. Just look at the month of January alone early in the month. I think people were thinking it was added to $70 a barrel and now people are thinking it might be going to $40 a barrel.","So that's the kind of volatility we see in this business and we're keeping the balance sheet. So we can execute our consistent programs, pay our capital fee from the dividend. Pay our buybacks back to our shareholders. So we're executing that consistent program. We believe in it and that's what we set out to do and that's what we described to everybody in November that it's not just one or two year plan. This is a plan that's got a lot of legs and can go on for the next decade; we have the portfolio and the people to execute on that plan. Now we have been in the bolt-on acquisition game. We had some assets that I described in my opening remarks, and we keep on the lookout for some of those kinds of opportunities, but we also I think laid out a pretty consistent framework at our Analyst Meeting in November, about how we think about both kinds of opportunities. And I think you and others have reported there. There needs to be consolidation in this business. But there still a pretty big gap between buyers and sellers is what we see in the business. So we don't have to do anything because we've got a solid plan in terms of what we are going to do and we are not applying to what's going on around this in the industry either.","So we try to layout a pretty consistent framework and how we think about resource as both organically through exploration channel, conversion within our resource portfolio and inorganically when we think about that piece of business as well. So we are happy with where we are at but we obviously watch everything very closely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","NeilMehta","Good morning, team. And thanks for taking the time today. The opening question I had is around Venezuela recognizing there are sensitivities around securing the cash flow that's own to the company. How should we think about modeling that on a go forward basis and what are the steps you are taking to ensure that the cash can be collected?","DonWallette","Okay. Neil, this is Don. I'll address that question. I think the first thing I would say is kind of repeat of what I've said the last six or seven quarters which is we've never forecasted that we would be receiving those payments just because of the risk involved. And so we would never encourage anybody else to delve into the forecast as well. We did manage to receive six or seven quarterly installments from PDVSA but as of the fourth quarter we received no payments and what we've done as a result is that and after October, November we issued default notices to PDVSA. And as of today they have not cleared the breach.","And as consequence of that we resumed our legal enforcement actions. Of course, we're not the only creditor out there, it's a competitive marketplace. And so I think you'll understand that I can't go into any details at all about what those enforcement actions entail. But as you saw from us in 2018, you can expect us to vigorously pursue all legal remedies that we have available to us.","NeilMehta","And we appreciate that. The follow-up question is just around some of the demand issues in Asia. And I was hoping, Matt and Ryan, you could put into context how we should be thinking about some of that demand weakness in the context of other demand checks that you've seen and just how does it affect the way you think about your business, if at all.","RyanLance","Yes. And Neil, you're talking about demand for oil as opposed to say LNG.","NeilMehta","Both would be interesting actually.","RyanLance","Both, well, yes. So we do see some. I mean we - we're factoring in some demand loss in the first quarter of this year. And in that translates into some reduction in demand as we go through the course of the full year. I think our estimates still as we look at the markets and look at the global economies. We're still projecting something on the order of 1 million barrels a day of demand growth as we go through 2020. Now that's probably down 100,000 barrels or100, 000 to 200,000 barrels a day because of the current issues that we're facing with Coronavirus in China.","So we do see some impact of that, it will flow through to the storage side of the equation. So we'll see some building storage. We believe in the US and in the non-OPEC countries around the world as well. So that will put obviously some pressure on prices. We see inventory draws though coming later in the year and we still see pretty good supply growth in terms of total liquids coming out of the US that probably eats up most of the demand growth that we see coming from around.","So it's going to be another volatile year and that's what we've been preaching for the last 3 to 4 years because it's an oil-supplied world and any small changes in demand or changes in what OPEC or others might do for the supply side will create that volatility that we've seen in seen spades here in January as well. We do see some weakness in the spot LNG market it's - had some pretty warm winters around the world. So demand has been - demand growth, we still see over the long term in the LNG markets. But we've seen softness in the LNG side and of course how that lags in terms of how it manifests itself our cash flows for the company.","So but we still are long -term belief in the growth in the LNG market and still participating that channel of the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","PhilipGresh","Hi, yes. Couple of quick questions, first, just looking at the quarter in the Lower 48, we saw some declines in the oil production quarter-over-quarter NGLs and gas were up, I presume that was mostly mix effects in the Big 3. The Bakken and the Eagle Ford down but just any thoughts you could share around that as well - as we look out to 2020 and your guidance for 410,000 barrels a day there. Just any color you can provide around rig count and production cadence specifically for the Big 3. Thanks.","MattFox","Yes, Phil, it's Matt here. Yes. So I think you probably saw our numbers for the production individually for the Big 3 in aggregates it was relatively flat. There was -Eagle Ford was down in a little bit just because of the timing of when we're bringing wells on and there was growth in the Permian. In the Permian production a bit gassier than the Eagle Ford production. So that's why there was that and slight mix shift and in terms of the activity, the - we averaged 12.5 rigs in the last year and it's across the Big 3 and seven in Eagle Ford, 3 in Bakken, 2.5 in the Permian and that was -those were supported by 6 frac crews. You'll have seen in our capital that as we go into 2020 is pretty much the same level of activity in aggregate to the same capital cost for the Lower 48 as last year.","PhilipGresh","Okay, great. Second question for Don. The cash flows in the quarter looked a little bit light there. I think there is another bucket that had some headwinds, if you could just elaborate what might have been in that bucket and just generally how we think about cash flow for 2020, if there any moving pieces we should think about. Whether it's distributions or other things. You already talked about PDVSA but anything else we should think about. Thanks.","DonWallette","Yes. Phil, I can point to a few items that may help explain the cash flow in the quarter, the way we look at it, we take our ratable guidance items along with the cash flow sensitivities that we publish and if you do that and nothing else, you come up with an estimate of about $2.9 billion, CFO. And I think a lot of analysts came in at a number similar to that. Whereas our actual results were about $2.7 billion. So to start LNG realizations were about $100 million lower than what our sensitivities would have predicted because we don't incorporate a 3 months lag to Brent pricing.","Brent was up about $1 quarter-on-quarter but JCC fell $5. So that's what's causing that impact. In addition to that, our adjustable controllable costs for the year came in at $6.14 billion versus our guidance of $6.1 billion. So that's $40 million or about $0.03 a share on that and that came through the SG&A and the items on, and you all have noticed that SG&A was up quarter-on-quarter and what drove that increase was basically two things so about equally split, the mark-to-market on compensation because of good quarter that the stock enjoyed in the fourth quarter. And the other was due to an accrual that was made related to employee-based incentive compensation.","So those were kind of unusual items and we also made a pension contribution to the US qualified plan that was probably about $50 million higher than what our typical quarterly run rate was. And so I think if you look at those items and even though we don't -we try to encourage people not to include the PDVSA $90 million payment. We know that some do. And so that may have been a contributing factor for some folks. As far as 2020, I think we've been pretty clear about what our distribution plans are $3 billion of buybacks, nothing has changed on that.","Our dividend rate is what our dividend rate is until we consider adjusted it probably towards the end of the year, so that won't have much impact. As far as CFO, you've got some new sensitivity that has been updated for 2020 in the appendix of the materials that we published today. And I would say, as far as a benchmark expectation on CFO at say current prices around $50 WTI. We would expect about $8.5 billion to $9 billion of CFO.","PhilipGresh","Okay, great, that's very helpful. Just one clarification with the proceeds from distributions, the $2 billion. I assume that's gross. Is there a net amount that you might have for that? Thanks.","DonWallette","I don't know that I can provide you a net on that. I know of our Australia headline, Australia West headline number there is about 1.4 and we would expect cash proceeds to be about 1.1 based on our expectation of closing at the end of this quarter. And then, Niobrara, the proceeds on that are going to be close to 400 about 380, but I haven't. I haven't seen the estimates on cash on that, but I would expect it would be close to the proceeds. And then the remainder is just smaller assets that will do to round off to the $2 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","RogerRead","Thank you and good morning. And I think that was probably the shortest management introduction, I've been on the call and at least for last several years. So congrats on that. Couple of questions to follow up on. One on Neil's question about the demand issues in Asia and maybe more specifically on LNG there. There have been some reports that some of the buyers in China made it clear force majeure and that's kind of a just-in-time market, so I get that. If they're not getting offtake they're going to run into other issues. So I was curious direct exposure to China as you think about it. And then the second question on the LNG front, just an update of where we are with the Qatar expansion and everything.","BillBullock","Hi, Roger, it's Bill Bullock, I'll take this one. First, we've heard similar concerns raised in the market about force majeure into Asia. With a date, we haven't had any force majeure declarations. So we are continuing to watch the market and see if we do, we'll be addressing those with spot sales or domestic sales in the market and managing appropriately. So nothing to date, but we have heard similar concerns","With respect to Qatar, we continue to be very interested in Qatar. We are well placed. Qatar is a great location with that serves the global market with low cost by resources and is a strategic location that works well for both Europe and Asia. We are still in the process. That process is being managed by Qatar Petroleum and they are in control of that pace. We're moving along at pace as they provide really can't say any more on that at this time. What I can say is that we're very hopeful.","The opportunity is going to be a competitive cost of supply additions to our portfolio and as we lay out in November, it needs to be a competitive cost of supply to be an attractive addition. So that's kind of where we're at for Qatar.","RogerRead","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up, is there any reason to think anything material has changed in the projects since kind of late last summer when it picked up and certainly the Analyst Day in November?","BillBullock","No, no, GP continues to manage a very good project.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","JeanineWai","Hi, good morning, everyone. My first question is on ROCE. Good morning. My first question is on ROCE was 11%, very strong for 2019 and the 10-year plan calls for a 1% to 2% improvement per year assuming you're $50 WTI with some inflation so ROCE about 16% in 2025. So in terms of what is contributing to this improvement. Can you talk about the ROCE of the incremental addition, incremental production adds relative to what you're achieving today? So perhaps any color you may have on the absolute ROCE of the Big 3 or maybe some future Alaska projects or in the other conventional projects.","DonWallette","Yes, Jeanine. This is Don. I'll address the ROCE question. So, yes, at the Analyst Day in November, we showed ROCE growing between 1% and 2% over the 10-year period and that's being driven primarily by production growth because we're working at $50 WTI real. So there is a little bit of contribution there. But the other thing that I would point to is our capital efficiency. Our DD&A is actually very flat while our production is going up. So I would point to those two being the primary drivers behind the improvement.","JeanineWai","Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. And my second question, it's on Alaska and I think exploration in the event that Alaska activity is either slowed or push further to the right for either regulatory reasons or otherwise. Can you talk about what other opportunities may move into the activity Q as a result and I'm guessing these are mainly exploration activities because we assume that the Big 3 in the Montney, all of those are already optimized for your 10-year plan.","DonWallette","Jeanine, are you referring to what we would do in Alaska or what we do elsewhere in the globe?","JeanineWai","Elsewhere in the globe?","DonWallette","Yes, so this year about half of our exploration capital is going into Alaska and half is going elsewhere. So the primary areas outside our Norway exploration program that we discussed. And Michael too discusses that at the November Analyst Day, and we also have an exploration program going on in Malaysia and the shallow water and shelf of Sarawak. And we have exploration activity going on in Argentina, both in the south of the country and in the Vaca Muerta. Those are the primary new explorations activity outside the Alaska.","JeanineWai","Okay, great thank you very much.","RyanLance","I would add, Jeanine, we set an allocation for exploration and if we don't have the opportunities to compete for the cost of supply that we said, we'd bring down that allocation. But today we're spending, spending the $300 million on our exploration that we've allocated to that channel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","PaulCheng","Hi, good morning, guys. I think first question maybe is for Matt. Matt, in Permian, the fourth quarter we see a big jump sequentially, should we look at it is just the normal lumpiness because of the well coming on stream or that this is signaling a beginning of accelerating development pace and that we should assume the growth starting in this year will be accelerating comparing to the last couple of years?","MattFox","Yes. Thanks, Paul. Yes, we did a very strong growth quarter-on-quarter in the Permian. It was about 23% growth and but that is, as you sort of comply this real lumpiness as we bring on new pads there. So we actually expect Permian to be relatively flat in the first quarter and then growth will resume again through the rest of the year. We had an unusually lumpy fourth quarter production.","PaulCheng","Matt, when that you think the Permian would take on a more accelerated growth and when that you think you will have sufficient of the delineation and the infrastructure in pace that for that to happen.","MattFox","Yes. So what we leave and this - in November was we were running at about 2.5 rig piece. We will build over the next few years to about 6 rigs running in the Permian, but that will be measured growth 3 as we get the confidence the much like we did in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and we're doing in the Montney. We make sure that we're at the right spacing and stacking and completion design. So we're still in a bit of a learning mode there and we'll ramp up the rigs to be optimum and over the next 2, 3 years. So there is a significant growth coming in the Permian, but is - that will be a piece is consistent with the pace of which we're learning and we hope to optimize the completion and spacing and stacking.","PaulCheng","Thank you, Matt. The second question is for I think, Ryan. Ryan, over the last 12 months ESG all the sudden become a far more active topics among investor even for the North American investor. And we are also in the last 2 or 3-year, we have seen some of the international integrate oil companies lay off that and move outside on making a lot of the investment that was signed into oil and gas for the transitioning of the low carbon fuel, transitioning on low carbon, were transitioning. From ConocoPhillips standpoint, I mean, how you guys look at that and say that with the transitioning in the low carbon world, are you going to essentially stick to what do you guys are doing in the oil and gas or that you will be evaluating other opportunity set to supplement that.","RyanLance","Yes, Paul. I guess right now we're focused on the E&P business, that's the kind of company we are. And that's what we're doing. And we have a strong record on ESG in terms of transparency, how we think about that piece, how we manage the transition, we're focused on eliminating emissions from our operations. We've done that over 7 million tons over the last number of years. We're the only E&P Company; I believe that has an emissions target that is out there for our business. So we're focused on. I'm doing that when we get the external recognition for our climate stance, how we think about our climate action report, how we think about our sustainability report and how we describe that, how we're doing -what we're doing in our business to make it a more sustainable oil and gas business.","So, yes, we're focused on being a low cost of supply and really taking care of our own business in terms of our mission footprint. And what we're doing in our activities to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, flaring fugitive emissions, methane all the above, that's we are about. That's what we're trying to do and that's how we're managing this aspect of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt Please go ahead. Your line is open.","JeoffreyLambujon","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on Alaska from an op standpoint. As you continue helping to inform voters on the potential ramifications of the ballot measure, can you just give us a reminder of what operations over 2020 will focus on in Alaska? And then any color on learnings from ongoing appraisal will be helpful as well.","RyanLance","Yes, so as far as our base operations. We've got a big operation that we continue to execute both [Indiscernible] and at Alpine as Matt mentioned, we've got some smaller turnarounds that we've got to execute this year, we've also got the ERD rig that's going to be starting up in the second quarter in Alpine. So we've got a lot and we've got a lot of drilling that's going on now. In addition, you asked about our exploration program and we're in the middle of that now. So we've got four wells that we're going to drill at Willow 4 appraisal wells and one flow tests that we'll conduct. We spud our first well at Willow at the end of January. So that's going on now.","In addition, we're going to drill three exploration wells at Harpoon and we expect to spud the first well towards the end of February, so we'll be running two rigs between the Willow and Harpoon programs. Now in addition, we have our Norwell opportunity that we spoke to you about in November where we had drilled the production well and we had tested that well and floated back through our central facilities. We produced up to 4,500 barrels a day from that. And from that production well and then that well was shut in as we monitor the pressure buildup.","Since that time we've also drilled an injection well that reach TD in early December. We flow that well back to clean it up just recently and we're quite encouraged with those results. In fact, our peak flow back was around 2,500 barrels a day that wells now being prepared for an injection interference tests with the producer that I mentioned we previously drilled. So we're going to do an injection tests and interference test to see how those two wells are talking to each other in that information is going to help us a lot as we optimize future development planning.","So we're quite encouraged with the results that we've seen in Norwell. So in short, we've got a big program that we're executing across our assets in Alaska, including at the non-op assets in our Prudhoe Bay.","JeoffreyLambujon","Great, thank you for the detail on that. But my second question, just a follow-up to the discussion on how you all look at inorganic adds and the potential for those to come into the portfolio mix. As you look at potential opportunities, compare them to the existing asset base. What would you say are the disconnects between what you think could fit and what clearly doesn't? Are you seeing quality packages with just different parameters on valuation? Is there a lack of availability of assets in areas where you look at potentially add exposure? And then lastly, are there any key differences between the domestic and international A&D markets as you guys look at the landscape today. Thanks.","MattFox","Hi, Jeff. I think I'll take that. This is Matt. Yes, you saw the last year on the inorganic front, we did about $300 million of inorganic additions in the Lower 48, Alaska and internationally. And we've lay out - Ryan alluded to this a bit earlier we laid out some very clear guidelines we hope and the certainly clear internally as to what it would take in order to make an inorganic addition to the portfolio attractive. And we'll say that has to have an all-in cost of supply including the acquisition cost of below $50 a barrel and it has to have a development cost of below $40 a barrel to compete for capital. So we've been very clear on that the criteria we would have to achieve. It is the same criteria for larger scale corporate activity and for exploration program and for resource conversion within the portfolio.","And so as we look around the portfolio, we can see some potential for incremental bolt-ons much like we did last year, but we're not at the stage of consummating any of those at the moment. But there are still opportunities out there that could be attractive additions to the portfolio as we go through time. As long as they meet those two criteria that I mentioned a minute ago.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","ScottHanold","Thanks. I think this one is for Don, can you discuss with the KBB pipeline down, how does that impact the financials? I mean what on a relative basis how does that generate cash flow relative to say the Conoco as a whole?","DonWallette","Yes, Scott, yes for 2020 and as Matt said, we're not counting on the resumption of that of Sabah, Sarawak gas pipeline. So the financial impact that we're estimating is about $90 million of cash flow and about $60 million on net income and that's, okay, and that's built into the sensitivities in our - that we published this morning.","ScottHanold","Okay, I appreciate that color. And turning really quickly back to Alaska again. How has the process or the progress going with evaluating a sell down in 2020 on that asset considering obviously the propositions that are out there? Do you find it's going to be a little bit more challenging in front of the November ballot to get something done?","DonWallette","Yes, Scott. So I'll take you back just for a second to November at the Analyst Meeting when we provided in our preliminary 2020 capital and production outlook. And at that point, we reflected that we would retain our current ownership level through this year. So through 2020 and at this point, we only plan to sell down after the uncertainty related to the citizens\u2019 initiative has been resolved and after we fully interpreted the results of our 2020 exploration and appraisal program. And when we progress through Willow through the concept select gate. So after we've satisfied those three current criteria that's when we plan to execute this sell down so that pushes the sell down most likely well into next year. We won't execute a sell down in a way that causes us to lose control of the investment pace.","We're already confident that there are multiple quality parties that are interested in these great assets. We would be open to an equal value strategic transaction or a swap rather than cash, if that makes sense. So that's where we are in the process, we're going to resolve some of these uncertainties and then we'll approach the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Allman from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","JoeAllman","Thank you. On Libya is with the situation in Libya now is production basically zero at this point and you having any thoughts on the outlook? And I know you don't guide for production in Libya. But what are you assuming in terms of your cash flow? What production level are you assuming for your cash flow guidance?","RyanLance","Yes. So you're right, we don't guide for production in Libya. Our guidance is excluding Libya. Right now because of the disruptions associated with this conflict, our Libya project company and the Libya National Oil company has declared force majeure and so we're just in the process of tapering down our production. We are not quite at zero now, but we expect to be fairly soon. So our hope is that these parties can resolve this conflict, and then we can restart operations soon. But right now, we're tapering down towards not producing.","JoeAllman","In terms of your cash flow guidance for this year, are you assuming that Libya is offline for an extended period or you assuming kind of flattish production from the fourth quarter level?","RyanLance","Yes, we're assuming that it will just be offline then.","JoeAllman","Okay, that's helpful. And on the defined benefit contribution. My understanding is that it was around $100 million in the fourth quarter and that you're guiding for about $100 million each quarter through 2020. So beyond 2020 should we assume the same kind of constant quarterly contribution or is this just kind of like a five quarter catch up? And could you talk about sort of the cash impact?","DonWallette","Yes, Joe, this is Don. Let me address that. So in the fourth quarter, our contribution to the US plan was I believe close to $80 million. We probably rounded up to $100 million, but we plan to continue contributions at that pace for the next three quarters. So quarter one, two and three in 2020 and so what's occurring here is that we've implemented a liability management strategy that's intended to derisk the pension liability over time, so the contributions that we make this year are going to allow us to shift more of our assets from equities into fixed income, and that's how we're going to be de-risk in the plan and hopefully reduce contributions as we go forward.","So after the third quarter, you should expect that our contributions will reduce significantly and then hopefully depending on asset performance and interest rates continue to be quite small as we go into 2021 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ellen.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thank you, everybody. And thank you again Zanera. If you have any calls, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations and look forward to seeing all of you over the next several months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks Christine and good morning to everybody. With me here today are Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer and Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production. Jeff will cover the quarter\u2019s financial highlights and then Matt will take us through the quarter\u2019s operational highlights and provide some color on what to watch out for what\u2019s to pay attention to for the remainder of the year. Then we\u2019ll have Q&A in the last. During Q&A, if you can limit your questions to two. Of course, jump back into the queue if necessary.","We will make some forward-looking statements this morning. And the risks and uncertainties in our future performance are described on page 2 of this morning\u2019s presentation material and also in our periodic filings with the SEC.","This information as well as our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and additional supplemental information can be found on our website.","Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sheets","Thank you, Ellen. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you know, we just recently held our 2014 analyst meeting in New York where we reaffirmed our plans to deliver double digit returns annually to our shareholders.","We outlined our production in margin growth plans for the next few years and hopefully gave you increased confidence on our ability to deliver on those plans.","We have an exciting year ahead and as we reported this morning, are off to a strong start. So Slide 4 lists our key highlights for the first quarter.","Operationally, we have a very good quarter. We produced 1.53 million BOE per day from continuing operations excluding Libya. Adjusted for dispositions and downtimes, this is up about 3% compared last year\u2019s first quarter, so we\u2019re seeing growth.","We also made progress on key activities that will continue to drive organic growth. We delivered on key milestones around our major projects and continued our strong performance on the unconventionals.","Exploration and appraisal activities continued during the quarter in the North American unconventional across Mexico deep water, Australia and elsewhere. These activities are key to our reserve and production growth beyond 2017.","Financially, this was also a very strong quarter. We achieved adjusted earnings of $2.3 billion or $1.81 per diluted share. This was quite higher than expectations and I\u2019ll address some of the drivers of this stronger than expected performance on the next slide.","During the recent quarter, we generated $4.4 billion in cash from our operating activities alone. We also had positive working capital change of about $600 million in a distribution of $1.3 billion from FCCL, so a total cash from operations of $6.3 billion.","And our balance sheet remains very healthy with over $7.7 billion in cash and short-term investment fund on hand as of the end of the quarter.","Strategically, we delivered on both production and margin growth this quarter. We continue to expand our inventory organic growth opportunities to support our growth to support our growth goals. And importantly, we remain committed to deliver in double digit returns to our shareholders annually including a compelling dividend. So all in all, the first quarter was very strong operationally, financially and strategically.","So now I\u2019m going to turn to Slide 5 for a discussion on earnings. First quarter adjusted earnings of $2.3 billion were up 29% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter and up 30% sequentially.","Adjusted EPS of $1.81 was higher than consensus, about a dime of the difference of roughly $100 million was due to North American natural gas price realizations that were stronger than the realizations indicated by changes in market prices.","Another dime or about another $100 million was due to gains from marketing of third party natural gas during the quarter.","As a reminder, we have a strong commercial gas marketing organization that markets both equity and third party gas in North America. Given the high volatility in the first quarter gas prices, our commercial team was able to capture some benefit by supplying both equity and third party gas into premium markets.","This benefit from our third party activities is not necessarily repeatable, but it speaks to our strong marketing capability.","First quarter segment earnings are shown in the lower right side of this chart. So the financial details for each segment can be found in the supplemental data that accompany this morning\u2019s release. But then we address a couple of items about the segments.","Lower 48 earnings included the marketing gain. I just talked about it as well as strong realizations for natural gas.","Canada segment earnings were very strong and again reflecting stronger business prices and the gas realizations.","Gas realizations for the quarter were $5.81 reflecting both strong acre pricing and the placement of some volumes in the premium markets during the quarter.","Canada segment earnings also included approximately $60 million benefit from foreign exchange which was offset mostly by foreign exchange losses across other parts of the portfolio.","The last was pretty straightforward with nothing unusual to highlight in the quarter.","Europe operations performed well in the quarter with growth coming from several major projects. And if you look over the past several quarters, we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of volume growth in this segment.","Our Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment was impacted by lift timing differences in China and Western Australia but otherwise was in line with expectations.","And finally, our corporate segment was in line with our previous guidance.","So if you\u2019ll turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll cover our production results for the quarter. As you know our convention for production is continuing operations less Libya. On this basis, our first quarter averaged 1.53 billion BOE per day. Normalized for disposition and this is compared to 1.495 million per day in the first quarter of 2013.","The waterfall shows that over the period, we had 6,000 BOE per day more plan and unplanned downtimes and in the first quarter of 2013 and net growth of 41,000 BOE per day. That represents a 3% increase compared to a year ago.","The box on this stage illustrates the composition of this 41,000 BOE per day of growth. As we discussed at our recently analyst meeting we are growing in the highest marks and portions of our portfolio and this growth of higher margin production is driving growth in the company\u2019s cash margins.","And we\u2019ll discuss that margin growth on the next slide which is Slide 7. This slide show changes in our cash margins from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. And also, on a sequential basis.","On the left side of the chart are the margins on as report basis which were up over 20% year-over-year on strong natural gas prices.","And on the right are the margins on a price normalized basis. So on a price normalized basis, margins increased 13% year-over-year. Over this improvement, over a third or 5% is due to our underlying liquids growth especially in areas with more favorable fiscals.","The remaining 8% margin improvement was due to the benefits related to equity and third party gas marketing activities that we\u2019ve just discussed as well as Libya being down.","So we are delivering on our commitment to improve margins as we grow, not just generating growth for growth\u2019s sake.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared remarks with our cash flow waterfall which is another good story. So I\u2019ll move that now to Slide 8. This shows our cash flow performance for the first quarter. We began the first quarter with $6.5 billion of cash in short-term investment from the balance sheet.","You can see we generated $4.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Had a $1.3 billion FCCL distribution and a working capital benefit of $600 million.","We had capital expenditures and investments of $3.9 billion. And after paying our dividends and returning debt of $500 million, we ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash in short-term investment from the balance sheet.","We\u2019ve reduced our debt to cap ratio to 28% from 29% the beginning of the year. So we\u2019re in great financial shape and well-positioned to execute our investment programs for the company.","That concludes the review of our financial performance. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.","Matt Fox","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. So to begin, I\u2019ll provide a first quarter operations update for each of our business segments. Then I\u2019ll go over our production outlet for the remainder of the year. And I\u2019ll conclude with a preview of some key activities to watch over for the rest of 2014.","As we talked about each segment, you\u2019ll hear a comment spread through the presentation and that\u2019s true. As we progress through 2014 and then to 2015, we expect to see growth in almost every segment of our business.","And we\u2019re not just growing volumes. We\u2019re growing margins. Virtually, all of our growing production will be at margins higher than our average margins to be.","So let\u2019s go to Slide 10, our Lower 48 in Latin America segment, which continues to lead the way on strong growth of the company.","First quarter production averaged 507,000 BOE per day for this segment which is 7% increase from the first quarter of 2013. But more importantly, our crude production increased 16% over the same period.","The biggest contributor to this growth with the Eagle Ford with just an average of 147,000 BOE per day during the quarter. Our daily peak rate for the quarter was 163,000 barrels a day. So we achieved good momentum after the weather problems early in the quarter.","But currently our trail [ph] of operated rigs running in the Eagle Ford, I mean we brought 48 wells on line in the first quarter. We\u2019re transitioning to the 80-acre high low developments, spacing to outline our analyst meeting a few minutes ago. And we have additional pilots and progress that are testing other than spacing.","In the Bakken, we average 43,000 BOE per day and achieved a peak daily rate of off 54,000 barrels a day in the first quarter.","We\u2019re also performing pilot test in the Bakken to optimize our drilling and development programs.","Unconventional drilling and testing continues in the Delaware and Midland basins in the Permian as well as in the Niobrara.","It\u2019s still early days, but as we said in the analyst meeting, we remain optimistic about these amazing place [ph].","In addition to our unconventional activities are appraisal drilling in the deep water goal for Mexico continues at Tiber and Coronado, and exploration drilling continues at Deep Nansen.","In Slide 11, we\u2019ll give you some highlights from our Canada segment. Operationally, our Canada business performed very well in the first quarter. We produced 280,000 BOE per day which includes a 9% increase in liquids production from the first quarter o 2013.","Surmont 1 deep automating [ph] is progressing and the major project in Surmont 2 remains on schedule for first team in the middle of next year. At the end of the quarter, the project was 68% complete.","Christina Lake Phase E is approaching full capacity and Foster Creek Phase F remains on track across production and the third quarter of this year.","As part of our Western Canada winter drilling program, we successfully drilled 25 horizontal wells in the liquid rich plains across our acreage position.","This program continues to deliver good returns and also a lot of drilling inventory. And we achieved a big milestone on the first quarter by drilling the longest horizontals onto well effort [ph] drill in Canada over 13,000 feet.","There\u2019s an impressive operation on technological accomplishment. And it shows we\u2019re working 10-year [ph] to optimize the programs. We also continue to explore and appraise our own conventional place in the Duverny and Montney where we\u2019re encouraging early results.","I\u2019ll now cover the Alaska segment on the next slide, Slide 12. Alaska production was about flat sequentially at 200,000 BOE per day.","We remain encouraged by the improved \u2013fiscal \u201810 [ph] was brought why the passage of the More Alaska Production Act last year. And no, we plan to spend more capital in Alaska in 2014 than we\u2019ve spent over the past three decades.","This increased investment will mitigate the claims and legacy fields and provides growth from new satellite fuels into the future.","We\u2019re making good progress at Drill Site 2S and Kuparuk. The Greater Moose Tooth [ph] is one project in the west from slope. And the one inch [ph], north east west side project. That one inch [ph] news project is a third new project that have been initiated by the company since the passage of the More Alaska Production Act last spring.","We\u2019ve had a good one to construction season ad at CD 5 and remain on track for stock up in [ph] late 2015.","We drove two exploration wells in the western north slope. This one\u2019s and flat top one. And we\u2019re in the process of evaluating those results.","[Indiscernible] but the contract is saying to deliver six cargos in 2014 with first shipment this month.","In April, enabling legislation was passed by the state legislation to allow the State of Alaska\u2019s equity participation in the AK LNG project. That is a positive step forward for the project, but there\u2019s still a lot of feasibility of what to do. And we hope to move into [indiscernible] in the near future.","Alaska has become an attractive area for investment. We\u2019ve got a lot of activity underway. But we expect to provide additional growth opportunities for this segment in the future.","I\u2019ll next cover our Europe segment on Slide 13. Like the Lower 48, this segment recovered well from very challenging weather conditions late last year and early in the quarter.","Production for the quarter averaged 220,000 barrels a day which is about 12% higher sequentially.","On our last quarterly call, we discussed the startup of Ekofisk South and Jasmine. Eko South were ramping up volumes in conjunction with drilling activity. At Jasmine, we recovered from some minor startup delays and averaged 25,000 BOE per day for the quarter. And we brought [indiscernible] Jasmine in March. We also commissioned and started up a new San Juan Gas Plant at this Irish Sea.","On to our construction activities and nearing completion, the Eldfisk II for early 2015 startup. And also a commissioning is ramping up for the Britannia Long-Term Compression project for startup and the third quarter of this year.","In Poland, we continue exploring in the Baltic Basin just to the west of Gdansk. We completed two vertical wells in sidetracked one of them horizontal during the first quarter.","We\u2019re currently completing the horizontal section with an Eagle Ford style frack. And we intend to conduct an extended floor test later this year.","As you can see at the bottom left of the chart, there\u2019s a heavy turnaround activity planned in the UK during the second and third quarter, which I\u2019ll discuss in a bit more detail in a later slide. So our Europe segment is positioned for growth from high margin production this year.","And finally, let\u2019s look at our Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment on Slide 14. In this segment, we produced 319,000 BOE a day, 9% higher than the fourth quarter. And over this period, we also saw a 20% increase in high margin and liquids for this segment. Our 1Q plan turnaround at Train 7 in Qatar was completely ahead of schedule.","In Indonesia, we achieved first gas in the South Belut Project in April which is the fifth phase of block B [ph] oil and gas development.","We also achieved first oil in February at Siakap North-Petai and our non operated commissioned project is progressing towards that to open the third quarter of this year.","At Kebabangan, our topsides are schedule for sail away in the second quarter. And we\u2019re on track for first reduction by the end of this year.","And exploration, we drilled a successful appraisal well in Malaysia at Limbayong-2. And we remain encouraged by our findings there. So there\u2019s clearly a more growth potential in the Malaysia business.","APLNG also remains on track for our mid-2015 startup. From a combined downstream and upstream basis, we were 67% complete by the end of the first quarter.","Our appraisal programs continue in Australia and the Browse Basin and at the Barossa field for well start [ph] in March and April respectively. Both of these wells should TD [ph] later in the second quarter.","We expect this segment to provide significant production growth over the next couple of years.","Before I move to the next slide, let me briefly touch on other international segment. The key activity in this segment is exploration related. In Senegal, we spudded the first well two weeks ago.","In Angola, a rig is now on transit to block 36 and we expect this to spud the Kamush [ph] well late this quarter or early in the third quarter.","I\u2019ll cover the production outlet now on Slide 15. We showed this slide in our analyst meeting last month. We slightly exceeded our guidance for first quarter volumes, but otherwise our expectations are unchanged.","As you can see, we expect production to drop during the second or third quarter due to seasonal maintenance activities across our operations. And on the left side of the chart is a list of the key turnarounds and tying up entities [ph] for the next two quarters.","This activity will start late in the second quarter beginning in the UK, but the majority of our turnaround activity will occur in the third quarter.","And these turnarounds impact almost all of our segments. The key activities in the third quarter will be in Alaska, Canada, the UK, and the Bayu-Undan field in the Asia Pacific region.","Bayu-Undan is particularly noteworthy as this is a 36-day shutdown that includes brown field activity for the tie-in at two new subsea wells.","By the fourth quarter, our seasonal maintenance should be complete and additional projects should be coming on line. I\u2019m going to expect to exit the year at or above 1.6 million BOE a day.","Full year production guidance for continued operations is 1.51 to 1.55 million BOE a day excluding Libya. And this is unchanged from a prior guidance and in line with our 3% to 5% production growth target.","At this point, the biggest uncertainty in the ranges is startup of our non-operated commissioned project in Malaysia.","I\u2019m going to wrap up my comments with what to watch for in 2014. There are several activities underway to drive growth. Major projects, startups are expected at Gumusut, Foster Creek Phase F, Kebabangan and the Britannia long-term compression project.","These are important activities that should impact the 2014 exit ways [ph] and drive 2015 performance. We also expect to continue growth both in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken relate as some development program, details of the recent analyst meeting. And these are the expectations with this place over the next few years.","We\u2019ll continue our North American unconventional exploration and appraisal programs with the focus on the Permian and Niobrara. We\u2019ll also test that unconventional plea in Poland which the extended production test that I spoke about.","The company also found and to see additional blocks in Colombia last year with explorational commands in the second half of 2014 to test the prospectivity of the La Luna Shale.","Gulf of Mexico would be \u2013 more drilling continues in Tiber, Coronado and Deep Nansen. And we\u2019re also preparing to begin and operate the drilling program late this year or early next year.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll begin explorations drilling in Senegal and Angola this year. And if successful, these programs would be catalysts for growth into the next decade.","So here\u2019s what I hope you\u2019ll hear from our comments today. 2014 is off to a good start. We still will recover from some weather and startup delays early in the first quarter and exited the quarter in a strong position to deliver on our volume expectations for the year.","Our unconventional programs are performing very well and our major projects are ramping up or progressing towards that top.","We have another year of significant second and third quarter turnaround activity. But we\u2019re optimistic about achieving our 3% to 5% production growth in the momentum we built to continue that growth into 2015 and beyond.","Our exploration activity is focused on drilling and testing a high quality set of conventional and unconventional prospects. And there\u2019s sort of a lot to update you on the coming months.","So this ends our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll turn over for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). And our first question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays, please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey guys, good morning.","Jeff Sheets","Good morning, Paul.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Matt, on Foster Creek, it seems like you [ph] have been facing some operating issue [indiscernible] has been up and the cost has been pretty high. Can you give us an update, what is the game plan and how confident you are that you can return that operation into say a couple of years ago tie off operating cost structure.","Matt Fox","Yeah, these are short-term measures that we anticipate it would happen. As these steam chamber [indiscernible] and you expect to see steam oil ratios and [indiscernible] under those circumstances.","But they operate, there\u2019s a good plan in place to regain the steam oil ratios that the Foster Creek exhales [ph].","And as we add Foster Creek this [indiscernible] and move the steam from some of the more well developed steam chambers that can use steams. So we feel pretty confident across the creek that it will return to the high performance that we\u2019ve seen on the past.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Jeff, can you give us an update, any update at all related to the other sales plan in Canada or for their oil sand.","Jeff Sheets","We\u2019ve said on several occasions that we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to liken our position on oil sands. But that is something that we\u2019re going to watch or some of us state on that process, Paul. And there\u2019s nothing that in our plans for 2014 in that regard.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Can I just sneak a really quick one for Matt.","Matt Fox","Okay, go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Man, from an M&A point of view, looking at your portfolio in the upstream, is there any particular location that you think you may want to be more aggressive in acquiring additional acres?","Matt Fox","You know, Paul, of course, we\u2019re always looking ahead the [indiscernible] to add opportunities to our portfolio. We\u2019re focused on doing that organically. And the exploration and teams are out there \u2013 all the team looking for a high quality acreage that we can add early in life cycle.","So yeah, of course we will. We always want to take opportunities to strengthen the portfolio. But it\u2019s all about organic live growth for us.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","So there\u2019s no really any particular region or area that you think that you really have a hold and you want to be \u2013 substantially step up the land acquisitions strategic.","Matt Fox","There\u2019s no region where we [indiscernible] that really we have a particular hole, and I wouldn\u2019t want to go in. And if we have any specifics [indiscernible] looking at. It wouldn\u2019t be wise to do that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay, thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Hey, good morning guys.","Jeff Sheets","Hi, James.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Oh, afternoon actually. I just wanted to hear if you guys have had any plans on reporting results. I know during the analyst day, you talked about ongoing spacing test into Bakken, testing I think down to maybe four middle Bakken wells for spacing unit out there. Is that an ongoing test? And give a timeframe where you might have results on that.","Jeff Sheets","Yes, James, we have I think it\u2019s about it operated different pilot, operated pilot tests going on in the Bakken in particular. And we have some partner operated areas in the Bakken are testing different well spacings and different horizons.","And the timeframe, it takes a lot of time to really get results that you can feel confident about. So I would say, over the next year or more before we get really definitive results that would drive conclusions on the well density.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then I just have two kind of the housekeeping types ones on your cost. Obviously, you guys had a pretty good performance this quarter on production and other areas.","But to really jump out in the [ph] SG&A and the net interest numbers, I was looking for these on interest, now [indiscernible] pay down a bit of debt, but I\u2019ve been on to the impression that the capital interest \u2013 capitalized interest number is going to come down with cash again out of the portfolio. Yet the net number was pretty low. And then just the SG&A numbers. Is there anything driving those and are those sustainable running rates?","Ellen DeSanctis","James, we\u2019re looking at a couple things here. Hang on a second.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Sure.","Jeff Sheets","What the net is \u2013 the net interest number is higher than it was \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what really your question is. And we do expect interest expense to be higher because in effect we\u2019re no longer capitalizing interest and you see that in the first quarter.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Sure.","Jeff Sheets","So I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following your question there James.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","I think I was just looking at the kind of sequentially at the numbers. I mean, I was \u2013 yes, it was up over Q1 \u201813 \u2013","Jeff Sheets","Yes. I think in Q4 it\u2019s roughly the same number. And you can just have slight variations during the quarter, so.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, great. Then on the G&A number?","Jeff Sheets","G&A can also be a little bit lumpy as well quarter-over-quarter. I think we don\u2019t try to give any guidance separate for production and operating cost and for G&A. What we said back at our analyst presentation as you recall is that we\u2019ve see the combination of those to being $8.5 billion for this year which is a little bit higher than last year, but last year ramping up [ph] with growth.","James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning everybody.","Jeff Sheets","Hey, Doug.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Profitability and margins were very high in the quarter and maybe even that a [ph] record level even after normalizing for price as I think Jeff demonstrated. And on this point I wanted to see if you could comment on couple things, first, if the trend in cost across the global portfolio, what you do think there [ph]? Two, your leaping [ph] status in the most recent period, and three whether there any other regional profitability mix factors either on the gas side outside just comments [ph] on Lower 48 that stood out in the period?","Jeff Sheets","I would say \u2013 well, we made some \u2013 we made some comments about the obvious things. Price is of course as you point out were big drivers this quarter and in particular natural gas prices. But underlying the margin growth is still the same thing we\u2019ve been talking about, the movement of our portfolio, the more liquids into more production in areas where tax rates are generally lower. And that\u2019s the underlying effect, what we said, it was still around 5% this quarter.","We\u2019re not having linear volumes [ph] in the portfolio does make a 2% or 3% difference in cash margin see there every year [ph] for us this year. And of course the fact that we are able to sell gas at strong prices and have bargaining games that help this time as well.","In terms of other impacts, we mention that there were some minor impacts on lift timing this year, this quarter. Overall, lift timing was a negative on earnings mostly in the Asia Pacific area, and it probably impacted Asia Pacific earnings by the order of $40 million to $45 million on \u2013 in terms of lift timing, and with relatively smaller impacts across the other segments. But other than those things, there wasn\u2019t really anything very anomalous in the \u2013 in the numbers.","You asked about kind of trends on cost, kind of like on the previous question, what we are seeing is cost are going up as production is going up. But all that is covered by the fact that we\u2019re producing higher value product. So overall, cash margins are going up like we\u2019ve been talking about.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Sure. And then Matt, you talked about Alaska where you guys are obviously one of the leaders up in the state. And while it might be only \u2013 my question is whether or not the improvement in your opportunity set appears likely to be significant enough to be able to stabilize your output up there maybe [ph]. What I\u2019m trying to gauge is whether or not Alaska can end up being significant enough to reps in another way of [ph] growth for the company over a reasonable period of time.","Matt Fox","Yes. I mean, we are the biggest producer up there as you know Doug. And this change in the fiscal regime has opened up opportunities there to stabilize with the claim [ph] from our overall asset-based. Our asset-base up there declines of about 7.5% a year.","So the development activity that we have going on just \u2013 and field development drilling and in the major projects that we are \u2013 that we\u2019re kicking off, the engineering firm [ph] moving towards sanction, we\u2019re hopeful that we should be \u2013 that we could stabilize Alaska production. And dependent on the \u2013 how the things basically as we [ph] put these development plans together, there\u2019s a possibility that we could see growth in Alaska, but even just stabilizing production in an assay of [ph] that size and that maturity would be a pretty good accomplishment. And I think that\u2019s achievable over the long run.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning, good afternoon everyone. Matt, thanks to your comments. I had a kind of high level question about your acceleration the Eagle Ford and maybe the Bakken too. How representative do you [ph] think you are at the wider competition that you have in those areas? I guess what I\u2019m driving at is to an extent you were slower to ramp up than some of your competitors, but have \u2013 at the analyst meeting put through a significant increase in your outlook for these areas. Do you feel like that\u2019s represents what everyone is seeing or that you\u2019re going to be acting and [ph] moving much faster than your competition? And I guess I was also thinking of any geologic implications you think about where you located them [ph], what you\u2019re seeing against what would be the wider trend in the play. Thanks.","Matt Fox","Yes. That\u2019s a good question, Paul. As you know that\u2019s quite a lot geologic [ph]. But even though all these things are essentially in Shale [ph] there\u2019s quite a lot of variability geologically as you move across the Bakken and as you move across the Eagle Ford. We think that the acreage that we have in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken is right in the sweet spot [indiscernible] in the Bakken is pretty clearly the sweet spot. The area where we have [indiscernible] maturity and sickness and pressure and geologic characteristics of our Eagle Ford position is strong.","So I wouldn\u2019t expect our results to be the same as everyone else else\u2019s. I would expect the \u2013 over the \u2013 as we continue this development our returns will be higher than the average returns because of the position in the sweet spot.","So you\u2019re right, we didn\u2019t pick \u2013 we didn\u2019t ramp up the paces last to some other instead [ph]. We did that very intentionally. We try to do it right and do it fast and we will focus on maximizing value. And I think that the strategy that we\u2019ve adopted in both of those places has gone a \u2013 has gone prove that to be the best long-term strategy.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Which I guess would imply that you\u2019re volume growth in this place will outpace the volume growth in the wider play?","Matt Fox","I mean, it is very dependent on how many rigs people choose to run. So I couldn\u2019t see if that\u2019s going to be the case for sure. But the \u2013 but we are going to see significant continued growth in both of those places as we showed a couple weeks ago.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","I understand contextual what\u2019s [ph] you\u2019re feeling about how others are \u2013 others are behaving as regard \u2013 in competition with you?","Matt Fox","You know, it\u2019s really hard to say, Paul, because \u2013 I mean, it depends on how quickly we\u2019ve been growing so far and then what we tend to intend to do in the rig counts and I don\u2019t even stay into [ph] that. But the \u2013 we are in the middle of the sweet spot in both places [ph] and we are really clear to our consistent strategy on how everyone execute that. And we\u2019re continuing to see upside in both of those places that we\u2019ll exploit over the next few years.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","That\u2019s great. And then just to close off, the follow up is how our cost in particularly in the Eagle Ford but also at the Bakken as regards to the activity that you\u2019re undertaking [ph]? How do we look at that? Thanks a lot.","Matt Fox","So is that operating cost or capital cost, Paul?","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Both please, but really I was thinking more operating, but \u2013","Matt Fox","Yes. So our operating cost in both place are really low. I mean, we\u2019re below $5 a barrel in operating cost. So it\u2019s a very low operating cost. That\u2019s one other thing that contributes to the high margins, of course along with the high liquids yield in both places. On our capital cost spaces, I mean, for this \u2013 the sort of wells that [ph] we have driven the cost.","So we are seeing a pretty much in line with what the rest of the industry are seeing up there. So obviously that competitive on operating \u2013 I mean, capital [ph] cost in both place.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great, [Indiscernible]. Thanks, Matt.","Matt Fox","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes. Two questions probably for Matt. Firstly on the Bakken, you said a couple more years before you get [indiscernible] to think about well done is going [ph] to appreciate. And that\u2019s not too fractures [ph] in probably some of this area is maybe slight off piece [ph] of that. Just on \u2013 what is it that you\u2019re trying to see? Is it the sort of the year two and the year three declines to try and get a sense of the economics of some of these wells? And then also we have data from some of these wells for about year so far?","Matt Fox","Yes. That\u2019s right, Ed. When you tighten up the well spacing, it\u2019s you saw we would expect [ph] the early period of production to look similar on wells tighter spacing and wider spacing. So it\u2019s not until the \u2013 until you\u2019ve got a sense of the decline characteristics that you can really get full understanding if the wells are interfering with each other and competing for the same oil or if not.","And so, that \u2013 you\u2019re right, you need \u2013 you need a few years to get \u2013 to get confidence in the \u2013 in the overall type of characteristics as you tighten up. You got to be careful not to load [ph] the pilot test to flatter to deceive because in the early days you do expect to see similar performance from wells on tighter spacing. So you do \u2013 that\u2019s why obviously and then [ph] we need some time to make sure that we are \u2013 that we\u2019re actually developing incremental reserves and having incremental values of tighten well spacing up.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","So a little bit premature to have your wells where we can [ph] have confidence in?","Matt Fox","I think so.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then on the Permian, I mean, one of the debates in obviously in the refining space is there\u2019s super light [ph] crudes that are coming out of the Shales. Obviously you have some of that in the Eagle Ford with condensates. You\u2019re doing that test in the Delaware basin and also in the Midland basin.","So I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any differences in terms of the \u2013 I mean, obviously people quote crude, NGLs and gas but they probably don\u2019t speak enough about the quality of the crudes that are coming out. Can you give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of those tests [ph] because obviously it will affect the infrastructure that\u2019s required and also the pricing of the molecules?","Matt Fox","Yes. Yes. The \u2013 you know, this may not a very satisfactory answer Ed, because as you go through this 500 feet of sort of stack opportunity that exists in the Delaware basin in particular, you get a very significant variation from some \u2013 in some areas let\u2019s say, gas with a high liquid yield and some areas let\u2019s say is a relatively low API oil, in other areas you got a strong condensate yield. It\u2019s going to be very variable. But it\u2019s clear that over the long run, there\u2019s going to be quite a bit of gas, NGLs condensate and this is going to grow in production in the Permian business as a whole.","And as our understanding and the industry\u2019s understanding will matures, that implications will what sort of [ph] off peak and the infrastructure requirements that are [indiscernible] fully evacuate all of these products from the Permian area.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And let more in the Delaware than the Permian?","Matt Fox","The \u2013","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","[Indiscernible].","Matt Fox","\u2013 but even in the Midland basin too, there\u2019s going to be \u2013 there\u2019s going to be some significant variation there. But I think \u2013 my sense there\u2019s a wider variation in the Permian than the Delaware but time will tell.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Matt Fox","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Hi, folks. Thanks for taking the question. Back at the Analyst Day, you kind of outlined the production profile where the US unconventionals were increasing and it seems like you were declining Europe and Western Canada, if I\u2019m not mistaken to kind of accommodate to where overall things remained pretty much in lined with your previous guidance.","My question I guess is what happens to those European and Western Canadian project? Is that simply being differed? And I guess where I\u2019m wondering is do we have potential into \u201815 for there to be an opportunity to maybe getting [ph] toward the upper end of the 35% range on production?","Matt Fox","Yes. We\u2019re very careful that if we are going to be just skeptical in an area [ph] that is deferring, we\u2019re not going to lose opportunities. So the Western Canada, we\u2019ve got huge infantry of opportunities there with a high liquid yields. And the European projects that we spoke about those are the deferrals [ph]. So both of those would give those areas for example are retaining opportunities to add growth in the later part of the \u2013 in 2017 and beyond. So I think that we\u2019re making \u2013 we\u2019re making pretty judicious capital allocation decisions that balance the short and long-term growth potential in the portfolio.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. So that\u2019s outer year not necessarily next year then, it sounds like?","Matt Fox","Yes, probably. But every year we saw \u2013 we look at the \u2013 we look at the portfolio. One of the beauties of that portfolio is the level of flexibility that we have and the level of optionality that exists. But the \u2013 but in general, the ones that we\u2019re talking about are probably more of that than [ph] opportunities to continue growth beyond 2017, but time \u2013 but we\u2019ll see, yes.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks for that Matt. The second one, I apologize if this is a little bit detailed, but I just want to make sure we have steep [ph] from a modeling stand point. The K&I Alaska [ph] LNG, from a reporting stand point, I\u2019m assuming obviously the earnings from that will simply drop into Alaska. But are there corresponding volumes associated with that? I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand if this is just going to be simply margin expansion or if there will be both production and earnings increases.","Matt Fox","So there will be both but the production growth is relatively small. So each of those LNG tankers that we will load in K&I [ph] are about \u2013 contain about 2.7 high BCF of gas. And our expectation is that about 40% of that are soon will be [ph] equity gas, ConocoPhillips equity gas, and then there will be third party gas that we\u2019re moving for those tankers as well.","So there will be some production growth but annualized over the years relatively modest full [ph] [indiscernible] something like that over the year. But the \u2013 but we do get \u2013 we do get very good margins, good value from that business.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me on. Jeff, can I start with the DD&A guidance for the year, is that really going to be Bakken loaded compared to what you\u2019ve done in Q1? I think in your analyst that you said [indiscernible] and one or two others might be responsible for that. What should we think of that as a unit DD&A [indiscernible] let\u2019s say at the end of the year when the production is online?","Jeff Sheets","So we give guidance Doug, of $8.5 billion per DD&A for the year. And what you\u2019ve seen we came in like one, nine or so [ph] in the first quarter. It can be back in load and really a few things drive that. One is, I guess we\u2019re starting up whether it was [ph] ramping up in the first quarter, that\u2019s one of the thought things [ph] causing increases in DD&A. We\u2019re going to continue to see increases in unconventional production in our Lower 48 as we go through the year. That will cause DD&A to increase.","But probably the largest single item is the when it moves to start up [ph] which is more of a third quarter item for us which causes that DD&A to be back and loaded. In terms of unit rates it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ll see that go a little bit higher. I don\u2019t have those just right at the top of my head here. But we still think the 8.5 number is the right number for the year. And then you\u2019ll see that \u2013 you\u2019ll see that back and loaded a little bit higher numbers in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarter.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","[Indiscernible] now Jeff. So Q1 was about 13 in change [ph]. And the average would be about 15 in change [ph]. So should we think something like $16, $17 kind of number in Q4 or that might be Jeff?","Jeff Sheets","Kind of order of magnitude. I think the way I tend to think about it more is that the DD&A doesn\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t apply to all of our production since you get equity barrels as well. So you got in our portfolio about 200,000 barrels a day of equity accounting barrels which don\u2019t have DD&A associated with them.","So I would say our DD&A is probably more like 15, 15.5 right now. And that you may see that drift up a little bit as you go into the third and fourth quarters.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Sheets","[Indiscernible] significant volumes in the fourth quarter in particular.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Second one, my follow up if I may, and just a quick one for Matt. Matt over the years it has been a debate between operators in the Eagle Ford on how you choke your wells. We\u2019ve seen obviously [indiscernible] with some very, very strong rates and there obviously in our well pressure part the reservoir [ph]. There is others like pioneer I guess which are a little bit sort of view [ph] and not [indiscernible] as you guys are, big advocate of kind of choking back to routine reservoir [ph] quality.","So I\u2019m just wondering if you could show us how are you approaching that in terms of how you think about the well race that [ph] you\u2019re getting at? Are you choking Bakken or you\u2019re trying to manage towards out longer term recovery or how do you think about it, and I\u2019ll leave it there [ph] there? Thanks.","Matt Fox","Yes. So we\u2019re more than \u2013 in the latter camp of [ph] managing the early rates. And that\u2019s driven by a few different things. The \u2013 we don\u2019t build our single well facilities so that they can handle a very peak rate [ph]. So you\u2019re going to only going to have [ph] a few weeks or a few months even. And so, that\u2019s a reason for doing it.","We want to make sure that we keep all the propane in the whole [ph]. We don\u2019t want to be having such a high draw than that were [ph] damage in our completions. And so, we do choke that way significantly. I mean, in the early month, we can have tube and head pressures over 7,000 psi, choke back. And then \u2013 and so, we manage it to make sure that we\u2019re not oversizing the facilities and to make sure that we\u2019re damaging the completion. And there are some evidence that that\u2019s the right long-term thing to do as well. You\u2019re not only start operating [ph] from an operation\u2019s perspective so that\u2019s the approach that we take.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that significant in terms of the upfront [indiscernible] does that slow you down quite a bit for a meaningful period or is it not really that material and you\u2019re just trying to get a feel for what your decline terms might look like on as well?","Matt Fox","So we can \u2013 on some of our wells we\u2019ll only be maintaining essentially flat production for several months and so over those months, you\u2019re choking the reservoir back. So it has implications for the first year average rate. And then so there does have implications for the observed decline rate. I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting at.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, [indiscernible] right. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Matt Fox","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Matt Fox","Good afternoon, Faisel.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good afternoon, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Hi. Just going back to your comments on the Alaska LNG project, you talked about sort of enabling legislation passed in April. Is there any change from the comments in those major analyst meeting in terms of sort of the type of spend pattern you would see for this project over the next few years with this enabling legislation haven\u2019t been passed?","Matt Fox","No, we were anticipating that the legislature would support the governor\u2019s approach to this. So our view of the spend profile for APLNG hasn\u2019t really changed. We were hopeful that we\u2019ll get to move in to pre-feed [ph]. And we\u2019ve already selected a high-level concept and I think I\u2019ve discussed in previous calls. But we need to get in to pre-feed [ph] hopefully in the second quarter here and that will last for over 18 months. And then we\u2019ll move in to the feed program which will take two or three years. So really the sanction of the project, we\u2019re probably looking out to 2017 or 2018 before we would actually sanction the full scale project. It takes about a time to [indiscernible] the engineering of something of that sort of scale as you can imagine.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, go it. And then just wanted to see if there\u2019s any sort of re-through [ph] for guys drilling program and go low [ph] with the sort of recent results by the Cobalt on this Orca DST, is there anything that changes? So is there anything in that data that changes sort of your outlook for the prospects you have at the end of this year?","Matt Fox","Not really. I mean, the way we\u2019ve been encouraged, I mean, by the results for the other operators we\u2019ve had in the area. We picked up acreage before the play had been tested. The results we\u2019ve had sort of seeing other operators and then sort of giving us encouragement that we\u2019re in the right part of the play and we\u2019ll know that before we get to the end of this. We\u2019ll have the first well done hopefully by before the end of the year.","But no, no change in our views really as to what the materiality and prospect of [indiscernible] in our Angola position.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, just last question from me. On APLNG, you\u2019d given some detail on that at the analyst meeting, but in terms of the progress on that facility, is it still \u2013 are all the major sort of components for that facility sort of coming online and are the producing wells sort of also ramping up the way you anticipate? I just want to make sure that there\u2019s sort of no risk here that this \u2013 the projects or the slips that we\u2019ve seen with a few others in that part of the world.","Matt Fox","No, we\u2019re still pretty confident we\u2019re hitting our milestones. The actual LNG plant itself on Curtis Island, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ve shipped all of the modules already but if we haven\u2019t it\u2019s pretty much all of the modules so we\u2019re on track. We\u2019ve built these plants before so we feel pretty confident that we\u2019re on schedule there. And the upstream part of the project, we still have a lot of work to do there. Remember, we\u2019ve got a lot of rigs running. We\u2019re commissioning our gas plants, our handling facilities. But we\u2019re still confident that the middle of 2015, we should be \u2013 have the LNG plant itself, the first train [ph] maybe and we should have the gas that we need to get that fully commissioned.","So I would say that we feel that the project is on track.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Understood. Thank you for the time, appreciate it.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reid of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning or good afternoon as the case may be.","Matt Fox","Hello, Roger.","Ellen DeSanctis","Hello, Roger.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Jeff, a question for you. I look at Q1 results and obviously we can strip out the payment from Canada. We can strip out the working capital advantage here in the quarter yet even after you do that free cash flow is essentially breakeven which given how you structured the company for the next several years, that\u2019s a real positive sign. As you look at the projects that are coming on line kind of the midnight of the 3% to 5% volume growth and 3% to 5% margin, does a quarter like this indicate any sort of maybe you get there sooner in terms of the free cash flow matching or free cash flow \u2013 cash flow out matching cash flow in and getting to sort of a neutral or slightly positive free cash flow situation?","Jeff Sheets","Yes, in that we had a quarter with very strong pricing. We had Brent near 110 still and WTI above 100 and very strong North American natural gas prices, of course, which helps our cash flow numbers. I think the way we like to think about it though is we\u2019ve got the growth and production and margins happening which are going to get us to that neutrality point across a wide range of prices and how quickly we get there can be influenced by prices. But by \u2013 as we talked about it in the analyst presentation, by 2017, we\u2019ve added considerable production at high margins and we\u2019re going to have the size of cash flows that are going \u2013 across a pretty wide range of commodity prices are going to get us to that neutrality point. Yeah, that could back up to 16 if prices were higher. But we don\u2019t count on having prices like we saw on the first quarter long term in order to \u2013 as the basis for our plans.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then from a strictly operational standpoint, heavy turnarounds last year in the summer and North Sea again this year, maybe, Matt, the question is for you is, is that going to be typical for your North Sea production over the next year, couple of years or are you getting pass sort of a pig in the python moment here, two big years of maintenance in the North Sea in the summer time?","Matt Fox","It\u2019s more of the pig in the python thing for the North Sea. We had a huge turnaround last year in Norway, the biggest we\u2019ve ever had. Yeah, there\u2019s no significant turnaround going on in Norway this year or next year because we have [indiscernible] we have Norway in a three-year cycle. But with some short downtime at Eldfisk to tie in for the new Eldfisk II project, but it\u2019s a handful of days from that.","This year\u2019s turnaround, it\u2019s a little bit less than last year. I think it\u2019s about 3% less in overall turnaround activity. But you\u2019re right, these have been two relatively big years in turnarounds and that\u2019s somewhat anomalous from that perspective.","Roger Reid \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Matt Fox","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. In your exploration section, you have a pretty extensive set of upcoming catalyst and I know that historically you\u2019ve talked about kind of shifting away from high-impact wildcatting. Is 2014 somewhat of an exception or do you think you\u2019ll continue this exploration run rate especially Deepwater going forward?","Matt Fox","No, I think we\u2019ll continue it. I mean, there are some really interesting wells that we\u2019re drilling this year. But no, our \u2013 we\u2019ve built an exploration portfolio that has a good mix of unconventional and conventional opportunities with the \u2013 as a portfolio that allows us to do this. So a significant testing this year but continuing that over the next several years in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. I mean, we\u2019re continuing to add to the exploration portfolio. So I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll have the 2015 and the years beyond that we\u2019ll still have an exciting exploration and appraisal program to exploit.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","So in the context of kind of flattish CapEx in total, do you anticipate that your offshore spending or just globally will be up year over year in 2014 or \u2013?","Matt Fox","No, well, on average I will say that it\u2019s about 15% of our overall capital, about 2.5 billion a year. And some years a bit higher. This year, it will be about 2.1 billion for example. So it\u2019ll be \u2013 it\u2019ll fluctuate from year to year but it\u2019s going to average, I think, around that 2.5 billion for the E&A [ph] program overall. And, of course, the split between conventional, unconventional Deepwater and shallower [ph] water, that\u2019s clearly going to fluctuate as the best prospects mature and we get to the drilling phase of the lifecycle. But on average about 2.5 billion a year.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Thanks very much.","Matt Fox","Thank you.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Pavel. We\u2019ll take one more question if there is one and then cut it off here.","Operator","Our last question is Asik Sen [ph] of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Asik Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Jeff Sheets","Good afternoon.","Ellen DeSanctis","Good afternoon.","Asik Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","And so I have a question on Malaysia. And Malaysia is a decent part of the growth equation over the next 12 to 18 months driven by Gumusut and KBB. How much Malaysian volume is embedded in the 2014 production guidance and could you provide \u2013 what is the incremental contribution from Malaysia expected in 2015?","Matt Fox","Off the top of my head, I\u2019m not 100% sure for the component of 2014. I would say it\u2019s around 20,000 barrels a year [ph] for 2014 and that would be higher but I can\u2019t remember how much higher in 2015, maybe another 20 by the time we get to 2015. So as, I mean, that\u2019s a significant part of the growth and a high margin growth is \u2013 but how much we\u2019ve produced this year in Malaysia is very dependent upon when Gumusut starts up the \u2013 but it is a significant part of the growth and it\u2019s good high-margin growth. And so we have S&P [ph] on production. We have the Gumusut LA [ph] production system [indiscernible] now. We\u2019ll bring on the fuel and flow production system for Gumusut and hopefully in the third quarter here, we\u2019ll bring on Kebabangan and late in the fourth quarter we still have the Malakai project in execution just now. And we\u2019ve got four or five other discoveries in the area that we\u2019re moving forward through the appraisal and engineering stage. So it\u2019s a good piece of business for us and it\u2019s going to contribute to both our production and margin growths over the next few years.","Asik Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks.","Ellen DeSanctis","Thanks, Asik [ph], appreciate it. And why don\u2019t we call it good day. By all means, call IR if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you so much for joining us everybody and thank you, Christine.","Operator","Thank you.
