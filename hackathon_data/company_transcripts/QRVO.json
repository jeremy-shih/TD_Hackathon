Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks very much, Chelsey. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. ","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. ","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website at qorvo.com under Investors. ","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; as well as other members of Qorvo's management team. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug, and thanks to everyone average for joining us on the call today. Qorvo delivered a solid March quarter with revenue and EPS above the midpoint of our guidance driven by content gains, operational excellence and a broad market exposure to long-term growth trends, including 5G. I'm pleased with our financial performance and how our team and factories are operating. ","Yesterday, we closed to the acquisition of Active-Semi International, and we welcome the Active-Semi team to Qorvo. We are eager to leverage our scale, sales channel and customer relationships to accelerate the adoption of their programmable power management solutions. We are also excited to bring their power management technologies to our existing customers. Our efficiency is a critical requirement, and power management solutions intersect multiple growth drivers for Qorvo, including 5G base stations, defense, automotive and IoT. ","During the quarter, IDP continued to reap the rewards of our broad portfolio of key enabling technologies to drive growth. Infrastructure was especially strong led by 5G base station applications. We increased our support of 5G massive MIMO infrastructure deployments and secured new design wins across all anticipated sub-6 gigahertz 5G frequency bands. ","Qorvo is unique and that we're able to leverage the breadth of our defense and base station capabilities to address the demands of next-generation 5G networks from 6 gigahertz frequencies through millimeter wave. In millimeter wave applications, our experience enabling phased-array radars with leading-edge compound semiconductor technologies is helping us to support the higher frequencies and beam stirring requirements of next-generation cellular base stations. ","In connectivity, IDP won the entire RF front-end section for meshed WiFi access points by a leading manufacturer of WiFi home networking systems. We won on the breadth of our technology portfolio and our ability to supply superior BAW filtering and WiFi front ends. In automotive, we expanded our support of 5G and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything for multiple automotive OEMs, and we now expect the commercial rollout of our front-end modules to begin in late 2019. ","Finally, in defense applications, we secured a design win to supply GaAs and GaN components to Lockheed Martin for a ground-based radar program for the U.S. Department of Defense. This multiyear win based on performance and reliability solidifies our leadership in GaN for defense applications. ","Turning to Mobile Products. We executed well on a challenging macro environment capitalizing on added content and integration trends at multiple customers. Qorvo's gains are being driven by leadership across product categories, including BAW-based dilutions, envelope trackers and tuners. We achieved record revenue for our BAW-based band 1\/3 quadplexers and secured first design wins for our BAW-based hexaplexers solutions, enabling our customers to achieve higher orders of carrier aggregation in next-generation 5G handsets. ","During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone by supplying production volumes of our BAW-based mid-\/high-band PADs to the world's top 6 smartphone OEMs. In addition, we received our first orders from customers for 5G variance for production this calendar year. And another standout example of Qorvo's leadership, we introduce the industry's first stand-alone ET PMIC capable of modulating the power supply at 100 megahertz for 5G New Radio operation. This allows customers to continue to select the most advanced best-in-class RF technologies for their devices. Our envelope trackers and antenna tuners are supporting some of the world's most popular wearable devices, enhancing connectivity and increasing battery life for this rapidly growing category. ","Finally, we sampled BAW-based 5G antennaplexers, enabling customers to utilize current antenna architectures for future 5G devices. Looking forward, design activity around 5G is accelerating, and that's expected to support a material uptick in the mobile RF TAM with an incremental $1 billion expected in 2020. 5G is being deployed with 3 distinct use cases: enhanced mobile broadband; ultralow latency; and massive machine type communications. It will be rolled out over time with enhanced mobile broadband beginning now. The deployment is expected to span years, putting us in the very early innings. ","In summary, our March performance and June guidance speak to our continued operational excellence and the strength of our business model. Despite a challenging macro environment, we are delivering content gains across leading customers and introducing breakthrough new technologies. As we begin fiscal '20, we're excited about our position. We expect our opportunities to expand as new applications carry even more data over wired and wireless networks and as we target new growth markets like programmable power management. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide additional color on Q4 and our outlook for June.","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fourth quarter was $681 million or $11 million over the midpoint of our guidance range. Mobile revenue of $443 million was supported by especially strong China and Korea-based customer demand. IDP revenue was $238 million, the 12th consecutive quarter and third year of double-digit year-over-year growth. IDP demand remained especially strong as the ramp of 5G base stations has begun. For the full year, Qorvo's revenue is near $3.1 billion and up 4% versus fiscal '18. We expect organic growth will continue in fiscal year 2020. ","Non-GAAP gross margin in the March quarter was 48.2%, 120 basis points above our guidance on lower costs related to inventory builds in support of our near-term outlook and improving manufacturing efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were in line with guidance at $161 million and up sequentially due to higher personnel costs, including seasonal payroll effects. Non-GAAP net income in the March quarter was $151 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.22, $0.17 over the midpoint of our guidance and up 14% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, Qorvo's EPS grew 12% to $5.76. March quarter cash flow from operations was $187 million and reflected inventory builds to support near-term customer demand. CapEx was a year low of $35 million, resulting in free cash flow of $152 million. Full year CapEx was $220 million -- $221 million or 7% of sales. Our portfolio management focus and manufacturing productivity efforts are helping us reduce and better manage our capital requirements. ","We repurchased close to $300 million in stock in the March quarter for a total of $638 million in the year. Share repurchases totaled 108% of Qorvo's free cash flow in fiscal '19. During the quarter, we also repurchased $68 million of our remaining 7% coupon 2025 notes and added $270 million to our 2026 notes at a rate under 5.2%. We ended the quarter with $711 million of cash and $923 million of debt. ","Turning to our outlook. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $780 million and $800 million or $790 million at the midpoint; gross margin between 45% and 45.5%; and diluted EPS of $1.30 at the midpoint of our guidance. In the June quarter, we expect IDP to post another quarter of double-digit year-over-year organic growth and to be up sequentially with the addition of Active-Semi. For mobile in the June quarter, we are forecasting robust sequential and year-over-year growth, including year-over-year growth in the quarter at our 3 largest customers. ","For fiscal '20, we currently forecast Qorvo revenue growth of roughly 4%, including $50 million from the recently closed Active-Semi business. We expect the Active-Semi programmable power management business will be accretive to gross margins and contribute a small amount to earnings in fiscal '20. As I mentioned last quarter, we are forecasting a sequential decline in gross margin in the June quarter due to mix and manufacturing costs. We expect higher gross margins through the balance of the year and currently project a full year fiscal '20 gross margin of approximately 48%. ","Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to increase in the June quarter to $173 million on higher personnel costs -- higher personnel and development program costs as well as the addition of the Active-Semi power management business. We expect OpEx to remain around these levels through the year. We expect the June quarter and full year fiscal '20 non-GAAP tax rate to remain below 9%. On capital expenditures, we forecast spend of less than $250 million this fiscal year and weighted towards expanding and improving our BAW, GaN and GaAs capabilities. We're very pleased with how we ended fiscal '19, and we're encouraged by a strong start and improved outlook as we enter fiscal '20. In the March '19 quarter, we executed well on a challenging environment, which allowed us to deliver results above our initial guidance. We also continued to improve our technology and operations, further strengthening our competitive position. For full year '19, despite a softer-than-expected second half, we delivered another year of double-digit earnings growth. ","For fiscal year 2020, we currently project growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. This outlook reflects the strength we are seeing in a number of our end markets and the health of our distribution channels. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Nice results. So I was curious, you've alluded to growth in your 3 top customers. I'm just kind of curious about that content gain. So can you just talk about the strength you're seeing particularly in the Android world, if you could just think about strength in the market units, maybe customer share gains and then the content story as well? Can you maybe just give some thoughts as to where all the strength is coming from?","Steven Creviston","Sure, Blayne. This is Eric, and I'll be happy to talk about that. Of course, in the March quarter, we did enjoy a significant content expansion with both Huawei and our largest Korean-based supplier. We've been, I think, pointing to this for about a year. As we gain more content on the highly integrated modules, mid-\/high-band in particular is a good driver for us. And those customers both did pretty well in the quarter, frankly. Part of our upside to our expectation was based on their sell-through. I think you're using that publicly in some reports. So the market is not terribly healthy, but we're in the right place with a lot of content gains, which is a tailwind right now.","Blayne Curtis","And then I just want to ask you on the IDP side. Obviously, you've had a lot of strength from the infrastructure on 5G side. It looks like in the guidance, you're talking about organic up year-over-year but maybe down a little bit in June. Just kind of curious to your thoughts in the trajectory of that infrastructure business in the June and then really for the rest of the year.","James Klein","Yes. I think we're guiding rather flattish, I would say, on the organic business as we go quarter-to-quarter. As we go through the year, I think we will continue to at least grow at market rate, which we're modeling at that 10% to 15% rate. The addition of Active is also going to help, but we believe that our management market is actually growing faster than some of our underlying markets.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","I guess just following up on some of your earlier comments. And perhaps you could talk about what may have changed in your view of the market since we've spoke in the last call. Obviously, we've seen some more cautious comments from others in the space. Was it really a situation where you just happened to be in the right sockets? And again, you made some production decisions with some capacity last quarter. Do some of the strength that you're seeing now affect some of those decisions you've made a quarter ago?","Robert Bruggeworth","Chris, this is Bob. Thanks for your questions. As far as what's changed all along, and I think Eric said it quite well. He named 2 of the customers. You can throw in a couple others. We worked very hard to gain back share that we've lost over the years, and we've brought out extremely compelling product. And I'm extremely pleased with how the team is now supporting the top 6 handset manufacturers with mid-\/high-band PAD. So we've done a good job there. And as Eric said, we're in the right places at the right time. We, like others, I think still -- we're taking much more of a cautious outlook in the second half. And I know you said some of those are seeing it now maybe, but I really think the team has done a good job of putting us in the right positions. And as far as the actions that we took with our factories, they were still the appropriate things to take. And as we said on the last call, if things continue to move well, we'll look at bringing back one of those factories in early 2020.","Christopher Caso","Okay. And I guess with some of the strength that you're seeing now, perhaps you could talk about some of the factory utilization you're seeing now. I know you're taking some utilization charges on some of those facilities now. And perhaps you could walk us through that and the impact on gross margins as we go through the year.","Mark Murphy","Chris, this is Mark. Yes, we're still not where we want to be, and the utilization is still weighing on us in fiscal '20. It's part of the reason that we're guiding to 48% for the year. But the outlook is improving. As you mentioned, we had a sharp downturn in the December quarter, and those actions that we took there, I think, are still relevant and underway. So the closure of Florida is still proceeding. Farmers Branch, we've slowed down spend there, and we've also dramatically decreased our CapEx spend. And I'll note that in the fourth quarter, that CapEx spend was the lowest percent of spend we've seen in several years, if not in the life of the company. ","And then I'd say furthermore and maybe more importantly, and you saw this in the margin in the March quarter, you're seeing productivity at the fabs pay off. We're getting shorter cycle times, fabs are more flexible. We're adjusting to demand better, so we're getting a lot more disciplined around our asset base, being very careful and deliberate about expanding that asset base and more aggressive in using it. So we think that with this discipline and then the growth that we're going to see, the actions we've taken run their course through fiscal '20, we're going to come out in fiscal year '21 with, we believe, continued margin expansion in part because of better utilization.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","First of all, congratulations on a very, very strong guide. I have a couple, but I'll limited it to two and then get back line. So Mark, when you look at the gross margin, you talked about this a little bit, do you see a pretty steady ramp to 48%? And I want to clarify, is it exiting the year at 48% fiscal 2020 or is it full year fiscal 2020? And how do you see the ramp happening from where you're guiding to in June up to the guide either for the full year or exiting the year?","Mark Murphy","Yes. It's good question, Harsh. I'm glad you've asked to clarify because the 48% is a full year number. So just to answer your question specifically, we're starting the year at just 45% to 45.5%. We said we'd be below 46% in the June quarter, and that's where we believe we'll be. The full year is 48%. The second quarter will be between 45% and that 48% average for the year. We're not going to call the quarter right now, but it'll be between those numbers. While I'm talking about the year, just to reiterate some of the guidance I gave in my comments, we believe we're going to be up about 4% on revenue year-over-year. And Bob alluded to this, but the first and second halves are actually about balanced revenue, which is a bit unusual. And then I gave comments on OpEx, how we're going to be in control through the year.","Harsh Kumar","Awesome. And then my second question, maybe for Eric, Bob or Mark, you. So June quarter up huge. This is very unusual. Typical seasonality would not indicate that. I know history is out the door on this business this year. But maybe you can help us -- you made the statement all 3 top customers will be up in June. Are they just ramping earlier? The guys are all ramping earlier? Or is it something else that's going on that hasn't happened before?","Mark Murphy","Just maybe just real quickly, I'd be clear, Harsh. That's a Top 3 customers year-over-year comment rather than a sequential one. But go ahead, Eric.","Steven Creviston","Yes, sure, Harsh. This is Eric. I'll give some color on that. Similar to the trend we saw in March, as we are exiting March, we're beginning to see the acceleration. We're currently at least forecasting a full quarter of it this quarter based on customer forecast. A lot of high-end handsets ramping and a lot of content transition towards integrated solutions. Phase 6, in particular, of course, is helping drive you throughout the large Chinese players as well as at Huawei. We talked about the shared transition back our way with our largest Korean customer. And it's across a lot of different products: of course, antenna tuners, also seeing envelope tracking in a lot of those applications. And then of course, in mid- and high-band PADs and low-band PADs as well in a lot of these phones. So it's an exciting time really. We're seeing a lot of handsets ramping. Of course, as Bob said, we're not raising guidance for the year. We're going to wait and see how the sell-through goes on all of these handsets, but it sure is good to start the year strong like this.","Operator","Our next question will come from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Bob, you mentioned the RF TAM opportunity for 5G in 2020 was about $1 billion, and if I remember at your -- the Analyst Day, you're projecting about $17 billion total. So I just want to recheck my math, if you're talking about a 5% to 7% increase on 5G. James, did you experience any shortage in GaN this quarter that could have -- for raw materials that could have increased your shipments a bit because [indiscernible] is reporting they couldn't ship all that they had demand for? And then Eric, you mentioned Phase 6 is ramping. That was out last year in a number of phones, but they didn't sell that well. Has that changed? Or are you just seeing more Phase 6 in more phones this coming quarters or anticipating better revenue?","Robert Bruggeworth","And as far as going back to Analyst Day, we're sticking with $1 billion. We still think it's pulling in since our Analyst Day, the ramp of 5G phones. I will remind you that I think handset volumes from our last Analyst Day are a little bit lower, so the RF TAM is a little bit lower as well. And Apple clearly didn't have the kind of year for that base for this year we were expecting. But we're sticking with $1 billion because we're seeing it pull in since our Analyst Day. And James, if you want to talk about GaN and the ramping that we're doing there.","James Klein","Yes. First of all, for 5G on the infrastructure side, that also represents probably a $600 million or $700 million opportunity for us during year as well. As far as GaN shortages, we definitely are struggling a bit to keep up, so we've got strong orders across all of the frequency bands that are ramping now and doing our best to stay caught up, but definitely a little bit behind.","Steven Creviston","And regarding Phase 6 traction, it's a bit of a mixed bag there. It's all up, but there's varying degrees of it. I think with Huawei in particular, we've seen a strong transition there in their top -- maiden P series phones. With the rest of China, it's pretty much on track with what we had thought. It's definitely well behind. We're in the early innings there, but we're also adding a lot of other content with ultrahigh-band as an example in other placements of envelope -- excuse me, antenna tuners and with the antennaplexers that we've mentioned as well. So there's just a lot of opportunities right now.","Edward Snyder","Great. And then for my second question, sorry, Eric, your antennaplexers, we've -- Broadcom has talked about antennaplexers a year or so ago. We're starting to see them now. I know you refer to 5G, but this is bigger than just 5G, right? I mean 4G advanced, all the stuff going on with WiFi, the new GPS band. In and of itself, we should start seeing antennaplexers proliferate through most of these phone lines, even if we don't see a lot of 5G. Or do you still see 5G as a big driver for that? And do you see others besides you and Broadcom shipping these parts?","Steven Creviston","Yes. You're absolutely right. It's really built on a base today. It's expected that fundamental trend of just more frequency bands coming into the phone and no room to put anymore antennas. And you're right, those aren't all cellular bands. It could be WiFi and new GPS bands and so forth. So it's that fundamental trend, which actually has been going on for a couple years. But as you add 5G, not only is there even more bands to consider, but also the power linearity and the requirements for loss are even higher. So there's a lot of value in those as well. So no, it's a trend that's been going on, and we only see it increasing from here.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison","My congrats on the results as well. Two questions. First off, just back of the envelope math suggests at least I think in the full year guidance is kind of a flattish outlook for mobile, which maybe it's a bit cautious or you're assuming unit volume is down or anything that you could provide some commentary there considering what seems to be pretty big backlog of new products ramping here in the fiscal year.","Robert Bruggeworth","Sean, thanks for your question, and we are taking conservative view. I kind of commented that earlier for the mobile market. We still things smartphones are going to decline this year. As Eric commented, we're in a lot of exciting phones. It's early on in there. We'll see how the market acceptance goes. And for right now, we just want to make sure that we have a conservative view in the second half.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just WiFi -- the AX kind of ramp, how do you see that here in fiscal '20 knowing it was delayed for a couple quarters?","James Klein","Yes. I think it's accurate. It has been delayed a bit, and -- but things are starting to solidify there. I think we've received our first design wins in AX, and we do believe those products will start to ramp as we go through the rest of the year. And we also had a nice design win that we talked about in Bob's prepared remarks and in the press release today. We think that will also drive some nice growth as we go through the year in WiFi.","Steven Creviston","And mobile for WiFi 6, we'll track a couple of quarters behind IDP, of course, as we'll get infrastructure out there first maybe, but we're also looking at revenues in the first half of calendar '20.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Congrats as well. Just a question on IoT. You had mentioned a meshed networking design win. I was wondering if you could describe kind of your view on IoT and your product portfolio with respect to Bluetooth, low energy, WiFi and mesh and how you're kind of positioned in that market.","James Klein","Well, first of all, let me talk a little bit about how we've done. So our IoT revenue was slightly up for the year. That was based on some of our automotive wins and also our position in low-power wireless. WiFi itself remains a little bit weak as the standard [indiscernible] as we just talked about previously, but the fundamentals are still very strong. In the overall IoT market, I think it's still maturing. Several different standards are competing for leadership. WiFi, ZigBee, Thread, BLE, NB IoT are really the largest contenders. I think we're positioned very strongly across those standards, and in fact, in a lot of cases, we're standard diagnostic because we have SoCs that can actually support different solutions simultaneously in their ecosystems. We're also moving into several other verticals with our technology like lighting, electronic shelf labeling and wearables. And so again, we see IoT as a significant growth driver for the company as we move forward.","Rajvindra Gill","And for my follow-up question, on the long-term gross margin target of 50%, which you hope to achieve through cost reductions, mix improvements, factory productivity, as we kind of move into fiscal year '21, how do we think about that target now that you've -- would have been completed -- would have completed most of the fab transitions at Farmers Branch and Florida, et cetera? I'm wondering how you're thinking about the long-term target as well as now that we're seeing IDP, which is about 35% of sales, which I think is a record in terms of percentage of sales. Just any color there would be helpful.","Mark Murphy","Yes. This is Mark. We're not going to guide fiscal year '21. But on your question, certainly, our target is still the clear 50%, and we very much believe we can do it. As you pointed out that we're focused on the right products and segments. And as you point out, there's a record mix of IDP in the business this quarter at 35%. Eric's focus on the most highly integrated products in mobile and BAW-related revenue is yielding a better outlook and better results. And then we're doing a lot of work on the fab side with -- [indiscernible] is showing this from Texas Instruments, and we have -- and there is a lot of stuff in-flight in operations that we're going to benefit from. We're benefiting from it now. You can see some of that actually in the large beat to the guide on the gross margin, but we think that's going to be additional help to have us clear that target.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","William Peterson","Good job on the quarterly execution and outlook. My first question is on, I guess, Huawei specifically. Just wondering if you have any visibility on any potential for double ordering. We've seen other people in the supply chain speak to that either in 5G infrastructure or in smartphones. If you can speak how you see the channel specifically with that customer.","Steven Creviston","Sure, Bill. This is Eric. I don't think there's really any risk of double ordering. In terms of maybe front-loading their plan a bit, that of course can happen, especially when they're picking up share in the market. There's no question about that, I think. And so it's hard to be clear about how much of it is due to one thing or another. We know that underlying all of this, they are seeing increasing in share not just in their domestic market, but also in exports, I think, going really for them. And in terms of our own business, we are clearly seeing a shift towards the higher end of our portfolio as well, which is adding dollar content in envelope tracking as well as in integrated PADs both for low and high band.","James Klein","And I think on the infrastructure side, our deliveries appear to be generally matching the reported numbers of base station deployments. In fact, we're seeing strong strength across numerous of our base station customers. We've almost doubled our business in 3 of the top 4 OEMs year-over-year this quarter. The strength for us has really been associated with content gains, associated with massive MIMO and with our ability now to win the power amplifier slots because of GaN.","William Peterson","Okay. The next question is related to 5G, and this is a two part question. It's nice to see you're actually speaking of orders in 5G already for calendar '19. So hoping you can quantify and just kind of give a feel for what the magnitude of that order. And I assume it's along the lines of these BAW filter base and so forth. You mentioned the ETP. If you can clarify what are you winning this year. Secondarily, in a competitive environment, obviously, Qualcomm has been out there making a lot of noise about attach. But I have the impression that a lot of the customers really want to work with you. And if so, what are they really searching for in terms of the performance or criteria, whether it be with the base components, power amplifiers, switchers, filters, so forth? What is your key competitive advantages?","James Klein","Bill, this is James. Let me jump in real quick on the infrastructure before Eric goes to the handset. So for 5G, we'll see our base station business effectively double, and that is largely driven today by 5G deployments. Most of that is massive MIMO today and including GaN-based devices. And we'll also see our GaN revenue double as well as we go through the year, and we expect most of that is going to come from base station, although we've had some really key wins on the defense side as well.","Steven Creviston","On the handset side, we did identify some early wins with some highly integrated PADs for 5G. We also have been getting orders already for more discrete sort of PAs in the ultrahigh-band space as well and some design wins there for the second half year. Definitely quarter-over-quarter, we've seen an increase in -- enthusiasm of our customers for launching products this calendar year with 5G on the label. We're still assuming it will be relatively minor in terms of volume, and the real big ramp will come next year. But antennaplexers, discrete PAs, filters and high-band PADs are all being designed now with 5G capability for the second half of the year. ","On your other question regarding Qualcomm, yes, there is, of course, a competitive nature to it there. We're quite comfortable with our attach across all of the RF front-end content. We sell a lot of products that they attach of Qualcomm. Everything is completely compatible, and customers are enthusiastic about using the best-performing solutions they can. That usually drives them towards the leading RF suppliers. The one area where there's clearly an overlap is in envelope tracking, especially if you look to 5G. This is a very critical point actually in the architecture. ","We announced, in fact, a stand-alone, kind of normal configuration for an envelope tracking power management chip, which allows you to then reuse normal architectures across all the RFFE. This is in contrast to Qorvo's -- or to Qualcomm's approach in which they are distributing the ET throughout the RF front end. So we think this is a very important market and area for our customers to be looking into closely, maintaining a competitive RF front end, and it's, of course, very important to the performance of the handsets. So we're very proud of the accomplishments of the team of getting this 100 megahertz capability proven and proving that you can actually have the RF front-end components a couple centimeters away from the power management and still get that kind of performance. In fact, there's a very detailed white paper on our website if you like to follow up on that more.","Operator","Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Mark, I just wanted to confirm the loading commentary you said is pretty evenly loaded first half and back half. So that would sort of imply that the second fiscal quarter like it's up mid-single-digits Q-on-Q, which normally it's up like mid-20s. So I just want to make sure I know that you don't want to guide that far out, but just given that loading commentary, I just kind of want to make sure, is that right?","Mark Murphy","Yes. That's actually correct.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Great. And then can you talk about how much China, and you've given these numbers in the past, which is why I asked. But how much was China as a percentage of mobile products in March? And what do you think it will be in June?","Mark Murphy","Tim, I don't want to get into the habit of providing all the detail. It's been significant percentage in March, and it's -- and China is actually increasing sequentially in June while Samsung is going down at going down just as part of normal seasonality. So hopefully, that provided you some color.","Operator","Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Active-Semi, a rough breakdown by some of the key end markets, how fast the company has grown over the past couple of years, how you think about growth going forward. And from a margin perspective, I think you guys talked about the business being accretive to overall Qorvo, but is there any potential for additional synergies as you integrate Active-Semi? And then I have a follow-up.","James Klein","This is James. Let me talk a little bit about the business and then Mark maybe will handle some of the financial questions. We're excited about the opportunity that it brings to Qorvo. The acquisition addresses critical need for more efficient power usage in electronics. We believe our scale, Qorvo's scale, can expand Active's current business to fully address the $3 billion SAM that represents them today. We also believe that we can bring Active's technology to bear on our existing markets like base station, defense, automotive and IoT, which will further expand our SAM as we develop products in those areas. Integration is underway as we speak. We think it's going to be rather straightforward. It's a great cultural fit, and there's really minimal overlap in our portfolio. So I think from a revenue perspective, we expect, again, to be able to outpace the growth of our underlying markets, and they've been able to demonstrate that over the past 3 years if you look at their average CAGR. As far as synergies, again, minimal overlap, so we plan in relatively minimal synergies. Mark guided what the revenue would be in his prepared remarks.","Mark Murphy","Yes. So Toshi, yes, we guided 50 for the year. We believe it will beat that. If it delivers what we believe, we -- it's going to be accretive to the company gross margin. We paid cash for it, but for dilution purposes, assumed debt. And it would be slightly dilutive in June and then slightly accretive de minimis amount for the full year.","Toshiya Hari","And just as a follow-up to that, so is it fair to say the growth profile of Active-Semi is similar to that of the classic IDP business?","James Klein","Yes. Similar, but a bit better. And you asked about product categories, and they're really into two different areas. One is PMICs or power management ICs, and the other is in PACs or power application controllers. And both capabilities seem to offer significant advantages to their customers. The programmability has really helped them with time-to-market and also helped their customers with time-to-market, and that seems to have been a very nice discriminator in the areas that they're performing today.","Operator","Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company.","Karl Ackerman","Two quick clarification questions, if I may. Just going back to 5G infrastructure, you referenced some wins for massive MIMO. While that is ramping now, how do you see the dollar opportunity expand as macro shifts -- macro cell shift from LTE to 5G? I think you just mentioned $600 million to $700 million for fiscal 2020. Is that back-end loaded this year? And how do we see that ramping in your fiscal 2021?","James Klein","Yes. So $600 million to $700 million opportunity for us as we go through this fiscal year. About $1 billion opportunity as we go into next fiscal year. And the ramp is an ongoing endeavor. As I talked about, we expect our base station business to be about double this year. And based on the TAM and our ability to win in the markets, we would expect it to go up about another for 50% as we go into next year, and we're not guiding that, but just our ability to win and what we see going on in the TAM. Now that's based on the transition from macro to massive MIMO and the significant content increases in RF as you make that transition. We talked about before an 8 to 12x RF content increase as you go from a macro base station to a massive MIMO base station. And adoption rates, somewhere in that 30% to 50% range of our base stations will have MIMO capability.","Karl Ackerman","Very helpful. If I may go back to just mobile. How would you characterize your inventory across China handset OEMs? Because there seems to have been a near-term buildup of inventory in Q1, but I'm curious if your outlook implies a further component buildup or rather a drawdown from China handset OEMs. And if this demand is not ephemeral, why are you not restarting BAW filter production at your Farmers Branch fab?","Steven Creviston","I'll take that question on inventory to start with. I'm glad you asked actually the channel inventory that we have. Our component inventory in the channel is at historic lows actually. That's one of the things over last year that we've been working really hard on is building systems and so forth that allow us to run at a very, very lean inventory in the channel. That's one of the reasons when we begin to see a turnaround like this, we see it immediately, and we absolutely are dedicated to maintaining that same discipline throughout this ramp, maintain incredibly low component inventory in that channel. Regarding Farmers Branch restarting, as we, I think, mentioned last quarter probably, we did a lot of work on transitioning from 6-inch to 8-inch wafers to get more productivity out of the Richardson fab. We're doing things with die size reductions. We're doing everything we can to meet increased demand with just a little bit of additional capital exposure as needed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","A question on wireless and understanding your expectation is cautious into the back half just because of the market. For Qorvo specific, can you talk to just your dollar content kind of like-for-like in the back half of the year year-over-year and how you're feeling about that visibility.","Robert Bruggeworth","I'll take it, Eric. So Craig, we're feeling really good about the work that we've done to expand the dollar content in the phones that are launching out. We've got pretty good design wins in the second half that we believe we can continue to grow our content. My comments were we're taking a very cautious view of the second half of the year. In our quarterly call last quarter, we talked about mobile roughly staying flat for the year and IDP growing double digits. We're kind of sticking with that. We've seen some of these guys start off a little bit strong in the beginning of the year and kind of wining over the back half of the year. But there's no doubt in our mind that the dollar content in phones is increasing year-over-year. The RF TAM per phone is growing. We also commented on 5G coming in a little bit faster. I commented that, that's $1 billion in 2020, and we're going to start to see some of that later in the year. Where we're being cautious is not in our content, it's in units.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Appreciate your clarifying. And just as a follow-up in IDP, could you help maybe just frame the wireless infrastructure, not just 5G with this tremendous growth happening, but just overall a rough range of what exposure you have to wireless infrastructure in aggregate today?","James Klein","I mean we are, I guess, broadly exposed to the market, whether it be macro or MIMO and pretty much any of the frequency ranges that are being deployed today, and whether that be a 4G continuing to add capacity or a 5G base station. A very, very broad portfolio of products, including all the receipt side elements in the RF chain, plus now our ability to produce the power amplifiers with advanced technology. So again, I would say very, very broad-based. We are seeing the macro side of the business relatively flat and significant growth in the -- in MIMO deployments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","I had two as well. Bob, I just wanted to go back to this full year outlook. And I think you kind of justify the conservative on the unit side, but you did mention that you expect content to grow for you. Is that -- at every flagship customer? Is that at some flagship customers? And if there are any content shifts, what do you think is causing that? Is that technology? Is it pricing? Is it something else?","Robert Bruggeworth","Vivek, I appreciate the question. I've tried, that's why I was very cautious in my comments to not talk about future architectures other than generically the RF TAM. And I think that, that expansion continues. I think you've been around the RF industry long enough to know nobody wins every socket every time, and that goes for us and all our competitors. Sometimes it's performance, sometimes it's delivery, sometimes it's share balancing. Rarely is it price because these guys mainly buy in the high and on performance. So all of that applies to my comments.","Vivek Arya","Understand. And Bob, as we look forward to the 5G era, I think you mentioned about $1 billion opportunity at some time. What is the incremental content from 4G to 5G? Because when I go back to some of the very good presentations you guys have made before, it's about 5 to 7 incremental dollars as you go from 4G to 5G. So when you talk about that $1 billion, are you talking about the incremental? Or are you saying that it's $1 billion over the entire RF content in the phone, which could be over $30? So what does that $1 billion refer to? Is it incremental or is it the absolute RF content in 5G devices?","Steven Creviston","Yes. Vivek, this is Eric. As we talked about in our Analyst Day last year, we're attributing $1 billion of TAM increase in calendar '20 to 5G. And as we commented, that includes the uplift in 4G content to be compatible with 5G. So when you drop a 5G band into a phone as an example, the 4G has to be able to accommodate that, of course in the case there's filtering requirements, there's [indiscernible] and a lot of other parameters. So that's not specific 5G-only devices, but in order to build a 5G phone, that's the entire added content for the 4G LTE advanced pro upgrades to be compatible with 5G.","Operator","Our last question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","Mark, can I ask you, as you look at your gross margin profile, do you think as it builds towards the 48% for the full year, do you think you might be able to exit very close to 50% or possibly even slightly over that? Or is that kind of out of the pocket at this time?","Mark Murphy","Yes. We're not guiding quarters, Harsh. If -- based on what I gave, we're starting at 45% to 45.5%. We have a full year of 48%. I said that the second quarter will be between those two. You do the math. You're in the high 40s in the back half. So this is very early in the year. We're coming off a very challenging 6 months, so I hesitate to give any more than we're just working hard in a number of ways to expand gross margin.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Robert Bruggeworth","We want to thank everyone for joining us on tonight's call. We hope to see you at our upcoming investor presentations, and we look forward to speaking with you on our fiscal '20 first quarter call. Thank you, and have a good night.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference, and you may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Qorvo Q1 2016 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug DeLieto. Please go ahead, sir. Vice President of Investor Relations.","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks very much, Catherine [ph] . Hi, everybody, and welcome to our June 2015 Earnings Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide the supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends and our underlying performance. During our call our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website www.qorvo.com under investors.","In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question. Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Steve Buhaly, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Call. Led by strength in mobile products, Qorvo's June quarterly revenue increased 6% sequentially and 23% year-over-year when compared to the combined revenue of RFMD and TriQuint in the June 2014 quarter.","We were pleased to see mobile products grow 12% sequentially and 35% year-over-year as we continue to successfully capture a broad array of opportunities supported by long-term trends. In particular, the global demand for broad-based data continues to proliferate while front-end complexity and the performance requirements for RF solutions continue to expand.","The strength in mobile products was sufficient to offset a sharp sequential decline in wireless infrastructure related to a pause in LTE base station deployments. Outside of wireless infrastructure, IDP revenue grew approximately 9% versus last year.","Within this opportunity rich environment, Qorvo is winning by leveraging our expanding portfolio of products and technologies and offering highly integrated system-level solutions to customers, channel partners and mobile operators.","As a broad measure of success, our mobile products group surpassed its operating model of 30% operating income on a preliminary basis. That's all the more impressive when you consider our mobile product portfolio in June consisted entirely of legacy RFMD and TriQuint parts, and we've yet to in-source legacy TriQuint assembly, our largest cost synergy.","We're designing and developing an increasing number of differentiated system-level solutions that integrate our legacy capabilities and these Qorvo parts will drive growth and improved profitability next fiscal year. Some early examples include our BAW-based high-band RF Fusion, which secured multiple design wins during the June quarter, and our recently introduced BAW-based RF Fusion iFEM for mobile Wi-Fi, which was announced last quarter and has already received production orders.","These products demonstrate what our organization can achieve by leveraging our combined core competencies. There will be many more to come.","Within IDP we saw sequential strength across all our markets other than wireless infrastructure. In particular, I'd like to highlight some of our achievements in Wi-Fi and GaN applications. Qorvo is the leading supplier of RF GaN and we have released over 100 GaN products during the past 18 months in both high-power and high-frequency applications. We offer the industry's broadest portfolio of GaN capabilities with advanced low-cost packaging techniques and we are transitioning to 6-inch wafers this year. With over 15 years of experience, Qorvo is the only GaN supplier at Manufacturing Readiness Level 9, and we are recognized globally for environmental robustness and industry-leading reliability.","We continue to see strength in both the cable and defense and aerospace markets, where Qorvo is the GaN leader. We also sample GaN custom macrocell power amplifiers to major base station customers and we continue to see GaN as a disruptive technology, displacing silicon LDMOS which is the dominant technology today.","During June, GaN-related revenue increased 30% compared to the same quarter last year. In Wi-Fi the design pipeline, especially for five GHZ in the enterprise Wi-Fi space is very strong. Qorvo is expanding our strategic relationships with the major chipset providers as well as the leading suppliers of enterprise equipment.","In automotive, Qorvo was recently selected to be the preferred supplier for four out of five RF components in a next-generation automotive antenna. Leading participants from across the mobile data ecosystem are engaging Qorvo to contribute more broadly and more strategically to industry growth given our ability to deliver best-in-class system solutions.","As we have discussed previously we have signed multiple NDAs with leading customers and in the June quarter we pursued additional opportunities to layer on incremental revenue and we're moving aggressively to move these program from the prototyping and sampling phase to production. We're also working closely with the world's leading mobile operators to improve spectral efficiency and help them to maximize their investment in their available spectrum. We are engaged with dozens of operators and we continue to add to our carrier program.","Because Qorvo offers a comprehensive suite of products and the industry's broadest portfolio of enabling technologies, we are uniquely positioned to implement system-level solutions that leverage both active and passive semiconductor content without a bias for any one technology or approach.","With all major technologies under one roof, we can match the optimum technology to each customer's application, balancing the tradeoff between performance and cost. We're in the early innings of the deployment of receive carrier aggregation, which improves spectral efficiency.","This is an important trend in the migration towards global and super-regional devices. It's placing a significant premium on higher performance filters and switches and it's giving Qorvo excellent visibility in the leading smartphone architectures for 2016 and 2017.","As carriers focus increasingly on spectral efficiency, we also see transmit carrier aggregation driving RF content, first in China and migrating elsewhere. Longer term, the global wireless industry is working towards a goal of one gigabit per second speeds on the downlink and the uplink.","Another significant driver for the RF TAM is the migration from three mode to five mode and even six mode devices. Last year it was estimated that less than 40% of 4G devices in China were five mode, and we expect five and six mode devices will represent the vast majority within the next few years.","Looking at diversity of receive modules, an increasing percentage of these solutions are expected to combine premium BAW filters with high performance, high-throw-count switches, two areas where Qorvo maintains a competitive advantage. This market is valued at approximately $1 billion today and that's forecasted to expand to approximately $2 billion over the next three years.","So the increasing global demand for data is driving an exponential increase in RF complexity and RF content while the trend towards super-regional and global devices means greater performance and more functionality needs to be packed into smaller size implementations. The arrival of 5G projected in the 2020 timeframe will bring more bands and likely higher frequencies and even tougher RF challenges extending the long-term revenue growth opportunities for Qorvo.","Pulling back a little bit closer in, there are moving pieces impacting industry demand and our September guidance. First, the LTE base station market is soft. This is a continuation of what we saw in the June quarter, and we expect wireless infrastructure to be down sequentially in the September quarter.","For context, the infrastructure market provided about one-third of IDP revenue in March. It dropped approximately 40% sequentially in June, primarily due to a pause in LTE base station deployments. That said, the wireless infrastructure market remains a great market where Qorvo can do extremely well. We're looking forward to the return of the wireless infrastructure market, and we're bringing out new GaN and SOI products to support this market and the continued global roll-out of 4G networks.","Second, we've seen a slowing among handset customers in China. Qorvo has secured excellent growth opportunities in China, and China Inc. was our largest customer in June if you combine all China-based brands.","We currently believe some customers in China have a few weeks of excess inventory to work down, and this too is reflected in our September guidance. While the China market has great fundamentals, it can be choppy, and we're seeing a bit of that now.","At a high level looking across our businesses, we are very much looking forward to the release of several marquee smartphones throughout the remainder of this calendar year, and long-term industry fundamentals are strong. Design activity is robust, engagements are expanding with customers, channel partners and carriers, and we're on track to achieve our financial model.","We're proud of our accomplishments in June. We expect to finish the calendar year very strong. We believe calendar 2016 will be an even stronger year and the best indicator yet of what Qorvo can achieve.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for an in-depth review of our financials.","Steve Buhaly","Thanks, Bob. In the June quarter, Qorvo grew revenue 23% year-on-year to $673 million when compared to RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. This above-market growth was led by mobile, up 35% to $551 million. IDP's revenue declined 13% to $122 million, driven by a sharp decline in base station opportunities. Outside of wireless infrastructure, IDP revenue grew approximately 9%.","Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 33% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer.","Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei. Gross margin was a record 51.5%, up sequentially from 50.4% and up from 44.8% in the prior-year period for RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. The improvement in Qorvo's gross margin was primarily attributable to favorable product mix and synergies.","Operating expenses were $159 million for the June quarter. Year-on-year operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue growth. Within this, R&D grew 19% as we pursue opportunities in a healthy growth market. And all other operating expenses were flat.","The realization of synergies is allowing us to grow investment in product and process development while making solid progress towards our operating expense model. Operating income was $187.8 million versus $103.2 million in the year-ago period for RFMD and TriQuint combined. This dramatic improvement was led by mobile which, on a preliminary basis, achieved over 30% operating income while growing the top line by 35%. Net income for the June quarter was $168.5 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. This compares favorably to the original guidance of $1 to $1.10.","We've been Qorvo for six months now and there's a lot to be proud of. Revenue is up 33% over the combined TriQuint and RFMD revenue a year ago. The most exciting - part is the growth in operating income, up 178%. Synergy achievement and operating leverage are driving real improvements in our business. We continue to make good progress on achievement of our synergy goals and expect to exceed them in both years. Looking forward, we see significant opportunities during calendar 2016, primarily in gross margin. We have a dedicated team and process, focused on executing the cost reduction opportunities presented by the merger.","Total cash and investments was $558 million and cash flow from operations totaled $141 million. Capital expenditures are $89 million, primarily to address continued growth in customer demand for our premium filters. The company repurchased approximately 602,000 shares at a total cost of $50 million.","Now, let's turn to our business outlook. In Qorvo, we've created a new leader in RF that can outpace the growth rate of our underlying markets. The total addressable market for mobile RF is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% to 15% over the next few years, driven primarily by unit growth of 4G phones and the associated increase in RF content and complexity. It's noteworthy that Q1's year-on-year revenue growth of 23% easily exceeded this despite significant headwinds in the base station market.","With a product portfolio serving the faster growing parts of our addressable market, we're excited about our growth prospects and feel we can exceed the industry's growth rate.","Achieving 28% operating income reflects good progress towards our full-year goal of 30%. Add in the substantial synergies yet to come, and we feel confident we can hit our model while making substantial investments in the process technologies and great products that sustain and enhance our competitive advantage.","Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending October 3. Quarterly revenue of approximately $690 million to $710 million, up 4% at the midpoint, gross margin of approximately 50% to 51%, a tax rate in the range of 10% to 15%, diluted EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 based on approximately 155 million shares.","Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report September quarter results on November 5.","With that, we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Bob, when I look at the September guidance, it's a miss of about $40 million plus or so. Could you help us quantify how much is the further weakness in IDP? How much is that excess inventory in China? How much could be weakness or any content changes at your large U.S. and Korean customer? I think we really need this kind of detail to give us more comfort around what caused the miss and whether it's a short-term event or whether there is something else here.","Bob Bruggeworth","Vivek, thanks for your question. As far as changes to the outlook, again, we didn't guide for the September quarter until today. So I don't know that I can bridge to what was in your mind. But I tried to size in my opening comments how significant the wireless infrastructure business is for us. And it's well over $20 million, almost $25 million from the high that we saw just a couple quarters ago. So it's a very significant number. So obviously no growth there, is at least $25 million of some of that growth and some of the slowdown that we've seen in China that we believe is going to be bleeded off over the next few weeks and we'll pick back up and we'll be back on track in the December quarter.","We feel pretty good about that. I don't know that I can size that because we didn't give any guidance but as far as content changes in any of the phones or major losses I don't see anything changing in what our expectations are for what we felt we had won, what we had won and how we think it's going to play out for the rest of the year. So I don't see any content changes, more of just what's going on in the market in China and then what we said in the wireless infrastructure market.","Vivek Arya","Maybe if I ask that question in a different way, which is of the 4% sequential growth that you're expecting, how should we think about growth in mobile versus the sequential growth in IDP?","Bob Bruggeworth","I think that's a great question, Vivek, and again, that's why we spent some time explaining. Last quarter if you remember we said we thought that the IDP business would be down slightly. It ended up being down significantly as Steve has pointed out, down about 13% quarter-over-quarter or thereabouts. And that was more than made up from the strength that we saw in our mobile business. This quarter we're expecting IDP to be flat. So all the growth is in the mobile business this quarter.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And just lastly...","Bob Bruggeworth","Sorry, Vivek, if I could. What I said in my opening comments is we are expecting the wireless infrastructure to be down offset, if you will, by what's going on in James' other businesses. So IDP is roughly flat.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then lastly in terms of OpEx I think it was - where are we in terms of the cost synergies that you had outlined before? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the next few quarters? Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Steve, you want to handle that? You had some comments in your script.","Steve Buhaly","You bet. I expect OpEx to continue to be in the $150 million, probably mid-$150 million as we kind of average over the quarters. We did spent a bit in R&D as we've pursued some additional opportunities that came to our attention, primarily engineering materials, prototype materials type expenses. If you look year-on-year or six months to six months, almost any of the comparisons, SG&A is flat year-on-year despite significant revenue growth and that really reflects synergies offsetting inflation kind of costs. And R&D is up less than the rate of revenue growth and the synergies there are allowing us to pursue some of these opportunities, which we feel very good about.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Gabriella Borges with Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges","Great. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just a little more color on the weakness that you're seeing in the China mobile market. Is it primarily on the LTE side or on the 3G side? Any color on whether it's concentrated at a couple of customers or more broad based than that? And if you have any sense anecdotally on when inventory could be back at more normalized levels. Thanks.","Bob Bruggeworth","Sure. Thank you, Gabriela. Just at a high level and then I'll let Eric get into a little more of the details. I mean, we're still very much enjoying growth in China. We think the market is, like we've said earlier, in the very early innings of its migration to 4G. We're still seeing the trend of moving from three modes to five modes, six mode. So all the macro things that we see in China are all intact. The market's continuing to migrate 2G to 3G and some going 4G. So subs are being added. We feel real good about that. We did see a little bit of strength last quarter in our China market and they're digesting some of that. But I'll let Eric talk maybe a little more.","Eric Creviston","I think you covered the high points really well. Long term nothing's changed. We think that the China market's very much on track and one of our greatest growth opportunities. We think our content there is set to grow as well as our share opportunity. We did have a very big quarter last quarter in China. In fact, basically all of the upside that we experienced to our expectations were due to China, and so consequently we're kind of going through a cooling off period digesting some of that growth. As we said, we think this is weeks, not months of a correction here. So by the end of this quarter we expect things to be back on track heading out of the quarter.","Gabriela Borges","And maybe just a follow up then on the share position in China. Maybe relative to three months or six months ago, any update on how you feel the traction for products like RF Flex and RF Fusion are materializing relative to expectations. And how you feel about your position on reference designs as well.","Eric Creviston","Thanks for the question. We did announce in the earnings release that we are in production with RF Flex. Last quarter we had said we had design in. So now we're already shipping production just as we were exiting the quarter. So we are seeing adoption of that and we're having a lot of design-in activity around Fusion, both with reference designs as well as with the end customers there. So great traction with the highly integrated products, which gives us an opportunity to address virtually all of the RF content in any of these handsets. And we already have many of the flagship devices there with the leading suppliers in which we have multiple dollars of content. So we see a good base and a lot of opportunity to grow from there.","Gabriela Borges","Appreciate the color. Thanks very much.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue on to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Mike Burton","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. So first, a two parter. Hoping you can help us understand how your orders tracked during the quarter and into the September quarter so far that's causing the below seasonal guide for the September quarter. And then secondly, if there is some inventory in China, how do you expect the December quarter to look at this point versus normal seasonality?","I realize it bounces a lot - bounces around quite a bit, but it's been right around the 5% range. And lastly, I guess just in line with that, at a recent conference call, you guys spoke about the second half representing roughly 55% to 58% of the revenues for the year. I'm assuming that's changed a little bit. I was wondering if you could update us on that. Thanks.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Mike. A lot of parts to that and I'll take a stab at that. As far as orders tracked in the quarter, other than the surprise that we saw in the wireless infrastructure, things pretty much were on track. If you take the drop that we saw in the wireless infrastructure, I mentioned somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million as an example. I mean that's the difference between our guide and roughly an 8% guide quarter-over-quarter which actually would be quite healthy at this season. We typically expect the September quarter, over June, to be in the mid-single digits, followed by something a little bit higher in the December quarter.","And we actually think, again, in the mobile business, that's pretty much how our mobile business is running. And what we're seeing is the lack of the infrastructure business, like I said, we're seeing that down. So if you take what that's down and add it to our guide over where we were a quarter ago, we're quite honestly tracking just like you said there.","As far as the weighting between the two parts, I think we typically have said more like 45%\/55%. And, Steve, you want to take that?","Steve Buhaly","Yeah. I think 45%\/55% is as good as any. Occasionally, at least in my prior experience with TriQuint, we would wonder up into the 57\/58. I think though to the long term, 55\/45 is a good metric to go with and I think that's as good a guess as any.","Mike Burton","Okay. And then also just looking forward at the carrier aggregation comments that you made, just wondering on the timing from what you're hearing from some of your customers as to when these are going to happen? Obviously you mentioned first on TBLT [ph] , but then looking forward to FDD, I was wondering if you could give us some visibility that you're hearing about when we would start to see that implemented into the high-end phones? Thanks.","Eric Creviston","So the account I think you're referring to is on the transmit uplink side of carrier aggregation, so I'll talk about that, as well as on the receive side. So as you know, receive carrier aggregation is in the early innings, but already beginning to roll out and affect the premium tier, especially in the U.S. We think the receive carrier aggregation continues to proliferate globally and actually into China as well early next year. And then really what you get on the receive carrier aggregation side is a real proliferation of modes and band combinations as you try to build global SKUs. And that's one of the largest drivers for the RF TAM over the next couple years.","Now the comments on Tx or uplink carrier aggregation, we do see that actually beginning in China by the end of next year, and from there it will begin to go out to the rest of the world or 2017 and 2018. So you're going to see most of the TAM driver in CA on the receive side for the next couple years and then on the transmit side continuing after that.","Mike Burton","Okay. And then sorry, just to follow up on my first question again because just I'm kind of running the math here real fast. I think the 45\/55 implies a pretty massive December quarter. Was that comment really for how you expect the split to go on a go-forward basis? And then is the seasonality - I mean, are we expecting kind of a seasonal build of kind of in the mid-single digits, which then I think would put your year-over-year growth kind of flattish. Is that really kind of the right way to think about it at this point? Just any help there. Thanks.","Steve Buhaly","I think we're better off sticking to that as a general rule of thumb versus providing guidance for the fourth quarter, calendar fourth quarter. So please treat it as a general seasonality comment versus attempt to guide the back end of the year.","Mike Burton","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh Kumar","Hey, guys. So the question I had is I think the big concern around your guide today is about your growth rate being less than the other guys that supply to your largest customer. We've had a couple of those guys report, those companies report. Could you comment relative to your business with your largest customer if basically that business is up to your expectation and all is whole with that particular customer, and the issues first of all are largely China and IDP. That's one question. I have a follow up.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Harsh. Eric, do you want to take part of that?","Eric Creviston","Sure. Yeah, I would say just as Bob said earlier, there's no change in our content expectations on any of the five cores that we see ramping in the second half.","Harsh Kumar","Great. That's helpful. And then the second question I want to come back to Vivek's question. I think the Street's seen that investors want to triangulate on some part to the miss. Could you maybe tell us how many weeks of inventory is there in China? How much of a hit that was either in dollars of units, Steve, and if it's 2G, 3G or LTE. And also maybe some similar commentary how much of a hit do you think you are taking of the infrastructure side in your revenue guide?","Bob Bruggeworth","Well, our revenue guide I talked about the infrastructure side. What I can answer is what The Street expected the Infrastructure business to do, Harsh, but what I've said is we're down $20 million, $25 million over where we were just a couple quarters ago. I bet The Street was expecting that to grow, not decline significantly. I think from normal seasonality that's a normal seasonal growth for us if you take what the Street had us in at $665 million going to $745 million. That's much more - that's closer to double digit growth. So that's a lot","greater than the industry. So just the primary delta that we see is the infrastructure business. And just to be clearer on the inventory in China, we just said it's a few weeks.","Harsh Kumar","Got it. Hey, thanks Bob. Thanks, guys.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot, guys. So Eric, if orders outside of IDP were fairly normal, why the excess inventory in China? And why do you think it's weeks instead of months of a correction there? Is that what your customers are telling you? Are these on hubs? Just give us a feel if you could on why you're so optimistic that it's not going to be a long-term correction.","And then James, the big hit obviously to infrastructure and it sounds like it's going to be flat. Why do you think it's going to be flat instead of down? Do the order patterns suggest that that's firming up? And what other big areas of your business do you have that kind of exposure to? I think Bob said it was like 30%. So if you could just help everybody understand what are the big chunks that go up to make up your revenue that would probably be helpful too.","Bob Bruggeworth","All right, James. Why don't we have Eric go first?","James Klein","Yeah, go ahead, Eric.","Eric Creviston","Sure, Ed. Yeah, it is a little hard to track exactly where all the parts are going in China. Most of our parts are sold across multiple customers as well as multiple basebands in some cases. And if they're shipped between basebands and also between customers and then within models at your customers, it's not possible to track exactly where every part is going. So again we saw a very, very strong June quarter in China and a very healthy ship-in. And then we saw a lot of mix change at our customers. And I think some of them in particular ended up with a lot more inventory than they were planning by the end of the quarter, and they just have to digest through that.","James Klein","Eric, let me talk a little bit at this exchange [ph] about wireless infrastructure. We were down, as Bob said, about 40% quarter-over-quarter. And I think we fared a little bit better than some of our competitors in that marketplace, but we were down about 40%. Go-forward basis we think will be down a little bit again this quarter, but it does feel like it's bottoming out. We're seeing some positive signs from the market, and really our focus right now is to make sure we're ready for when it bounces back. We certainly see that the demand will be there long term and come back, and there's no shortage of demand for the deployment of 4G around the world. So as far as other businesses, we had a record quarter in cable. Optical and Wi-Fi and automotive businesses were all strong.","Our defense business was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter but that's typically been fairly lumpy for us and we're expecting in the defense side to have a strong second half. So, to Bob's note earlier, I think again it really was a wireless infrastructure pause for us. And we feel like we're starting to see the bottom of that.","Edward Snyder","And then, Steve, your margin performance was excellent and you're guiding for almost similar, a little bit of a decline. With such a steep decline in IDP in the June period which is typically much higher gross margins than your cellular business. And your cellular business, or the consolidated margins, didn't tail off here. Does that suggest that your blend in cellular is permanently increased to a higher margin? Is this the BAW business kicking in? I know we talked about capacity expansions for the second half. Is that happening at this point now? And your CapEx is just more of the same in the second half? Just trying to get an idea of how the margin mix now between the businesses, especially with regard to BAW, is shaking out.","Steve Buhaly","Ed, your thesis is basically correct. We saw, as we have in other quarters, above average growth in our higher margin filters, premium filters and switches portion of mobile. And overall Eric and the team along with his friends in manufacturing have done a terrific job of improving the overall baseline margins in mobile. So between those two things, we were able to overcome the hit in the wireless infrastructure market.","Edward Snyder","But Steve, just your consolidated margins are still lower than IDP, correct?","Steve Buhaly","That's correct.","Edward Snyder","So once IDP comes back, and assuming that it does, then your consolidated margin profile will be a lot higher than June given the steep drop in IDP? Isn't that a fair assumption? If it were to come back.","Steve Buhaly","Certainly a part of it will be accretive. Now mobile always has the capability of outgrowing, James, pretty handily. So your mileage will vary a little bit quarter by quarter. But again, your thesis is correct. Seeing the wireless infrastructure come back will be very helpful for our overall margin.","Edward Snyder","And the last time we spoke about BAW capacity expansion I think was in the December period you were talking about doubling it by June. From what I understand, that's occurred now. It sounds like you're continuing to expand. When do you run out of space in Texas?","Eric Creviston","You know, the big move next for enhanced capacity, and we're talking for the handling the peak demand that we'll typically see a year from now, will be a conversion of the substantial part of the BAW manufacturing line to eight inch wafers.","Edward Snyder","Historically that's been a real nightmare. I know you guys have been working on it. Where are you on that? Have you got production stuff? Or do you have stuff out of the engineering lab that looks like it could be in production? Any idea at all when you'd have the eight inch running?","Bob Bruggeworth","Go ahead, Steve.","Eric Creviston","We have a pilot line in place. We're comfortable with the progress. We think our architecture may make life a little bit easier than some of the other architectures out in the BAW market.","Bob Bruggeworth","Ed, we expect to be prototyping some samples by the end of the year and in production next year. The team's pretty excited about what they've accomplished so far, and quite honestly, things are on track.","Eric Creviston","And as you know, you not only get space savings, which has become more of an issue for us in the Texas site. You also get some fairly significant cost reductions. So we're pretty excited about it. It's an important program for us.","Edward Snyder","Great. Thanks.","James Klein","This is James. If I can add we're also transitioning our GaN to six inch in Texas and that's right on the tail of moving our PM [ph] to six inch in Texas as well. So quite a bit of transition there.","Edward Snyder","James, can you talk about how big GaN is for you now?","James Klein","Well, I won't go into the detailed numbers but we are number one in the market in cable and in defense. We see both of those markets continuing to grow pretty strong pace. Defense is really our strongest near-term growth opportunity and we're doing very well there, both domestically and internationally. I think as we sample, Bob talked earlier about sampling products into the base station OEMs and we believe we're positioned well for revenue really to start in that market in 2016. So overall very positive. I think we'll grow faster than what we see the GaN market predicted to grow.","Edward Snyder","Great. Thanks, guys.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. And just wanted to follow up quickly. So as we look out to December, is it possible you could get to something sort of in the $800 million revenue range? And if that's the case, does that require a recovery in the telco equipment business? Or could you do that on wireless?","Bob Bruggeworth","Steve, as you know, we don't guide out two quarters. I think it's safe to say that what we are comfortable with is we can keep up with industry growth rates. And it's obviously we've stated our plan is to grow slightly faster than that and we're going to stay with those comments at this time.","Steve Smigie","Okay. Fair enough. And you guys said you started to see a little bit of recovery in that telco equipment business. So does that suggest to you maybe Q4 is the quarter - I know everybody is trying to get at this across multiple semiconductor suppliers. But does it seem Q4 like a good quarter where you could see some of the bounce back from that sharp decline or maybe more Q1?","Steve Buhaly","Well, again, I think it's important that we feel like we've seen the bottom and we're starting to see some signs that it's going to start to pick back up. I've sort of projecting that we'll be back into strong revenue in Q4 but I do feel like we're on the uptick and things are starting to get better. And I agree, lot of reports on whether it's going to be Q4 or Q1 or when that business returns.","Steve Smigie","Is it fair to say that I mean, obviously, it dropped off sharply largely due to China. Is it fair to think that, that might recover sharply? Is - or are we just net at somewhat lower levels?","Steve Buhaly","No. I think it's fair to think of this as recovering quickly. And that's really the genesis of my comments earlier about making sure we stay very close to our customers, and we're ready for the return.","Bob Bruggeworth","Yeah. Remember the underlying expansion of 4G phones in China hasn't slowed down a whole lot. Right? And at some point those phones are going to need base stations to communicate with, and so we think this is a disturbance, if you will, in the market caused by some external activities versus a permanent reduction in demand for these products.","Steve Smigie","Great. If I could sneak one last one in, and, Bob, I apologize because you already - I already bugged you about Q4 and I'm going to have to push it by going to Q1, you sound - it sounded like you were saying, Q4, no reason you wouldn't see industry standards. So is it fair to sort of think at this point for Q1 that sort of seasonal or industry performance is what you'd expect in Q1 also?","Bob Bruggeworth","Yeah. As you well know and everybody else on the call knows, March is typically a down quarter and nothing that we've seen is changing what we currently expect for the industry. I guess the primary thing I want everyone to understand is we don't feel we've lost any major sockets since the last time we talked to you. We haven't seen any opportunities that we thought we were going to win, that we can't still win or have won from all those perspectives. From the mobile business, we feel very good about our position and we believe we continue to grow faster than the market this year, as well as next fiscal year.","Steve Buhaly","I'd add to that, I think 2017 has every chance of being a great year. Calendar 2016, we're going to see some truly integrated product designs coming out of James' and Eric's shops where you really bring switches and filters together, for example, to serve customer needs. And you're going to see us really starting to add to the COGS synergies, as we move ex-TriQuint mobile parts into our new China assembly and test facilities, among other things. But that's the largest synergy that's yet to come, so I think calendar 2016\/fiscal 2017 is really going to have a lot going for it.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Thanks, guys. Just a question on your second half. When you look at your September\/December quarters, your calendar September\/December quarters, do your mobile revenues show you a trend? Do you usually have December quarter stronger than September quarter or do they split equally?","Bob Bruggeworth","Typically we see mid-single digits growth in September over June and pushing high single digits in December. Typically December is much larger than the September quarter in growth, growth rate.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And as you look at your capacity that you're adding on the BAW side, what's your - have you changed any expectations there? How much capacity are you adding on the BAW side for the year and if you have thought about next year as well. Thanks.","James Klein","Steady as she goes. We've completed the major add supporting this busy selling season and as stated earlier, we're working on a conversion of a substantial part of our manufacturing to eight inch capability to support a year from now.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue on with Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton","Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the sort of split of revs between September and December. I think, Steve, back at TriQuint you guys often sort of cautioned investors that the timing of the ramp of the largest customer if it shifted out a week could really sort of affect the timing of revs between September and December. I'm just wondering is that at all in play here for the September quarter guide? Or are you taking sort of a more cautious view on the timing of that ramp? Or is it what you might call a more normal ramp for the largest customer and it really doesn't have any impact on the timing of revs between September and December? And then I've got a follow up.","Steve Buhaly","Yeah. So, Quinn, your memory's excellent. I often do caution and I continue to caution that very large customers' ramp timing can and has moved a week here or there and really pushes the sequential comparisons around. I don't believe that's a factor in our guide today. That doesn't mean it's not going to happen but it means if it's going to we don't know about it yet.","Quinn Bolton","Yeah. Understood. Okay. Great. And then for Eric, you talked about the transmit CA starting to drive content late in 2016. Just wondering if you might be able to give us some sense. What's the dollar content increase as a phone implements transmit carrier aggregation?","Eric Creviston","In the first wave of transmit carrier aggregation will be done intraband which means within the same band. And so there's minimal impact. Think of it as $0.50 or so of additional content. I mean, that's still significant on the type of units we're doing, but when we get to the next phase after that kind of 2017\/2018 that's where we begin to see multiple power amplifier paths. And you can easily get to $1.50 of additional content beyond that. So in the near term the receive carrier aggregation driving more like $1 to $1.50 in content happening and then another $1.50 on top of that with intraband after that. All of that as trend [ph] is also migrating from the majority today three-mode going to the vast majority being five or six mode over that same time period. That's why we're excited about being at the very beginning of a long-term growth in the overall TAM at China.","Quinn Bolton","And Eric, just another follow-up on that. Would that mean if you have intraband transmit to your aggregation you might actually have multiple PAs per frequency band or for frequency band range. Is that where the extra content comes in?","Eric Creviston","That's exactly right. As well as additional content in the switches, of course, to drive that and filters and anything that comes along with it basically. So there's a lot of things under the planning now. This is big part of our work with the carriers in our program to work with the mobile operators and drive these requirements and understand the benefits of it and which bands we want to operate at the same time. We're helping to define what can be done. And of course we're encouraging them to make the RF requirements very stiff, make it really hard, because they've invested in technologies to enable that and they'll get the most return on their investment when they do.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Quinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Tom Diffely","Yes. Good afternoon. First Steve, on the margin side, how much margin variance do you have inside of mobile? And is volume discounting the biggest variable there?","Steve Buhaly","Sorry, your last comment was on volume discounting?","Tom Diffely","I was wondering if volume discounts were the biggest variable inside the mobile margin structure?","Steve Buhaly","No. I wouldn't characterize it as volume discounting. Most of our higher volume, many of our higher volume parts are custom. So there's not really a comparison like that. There is reasonable variation amongst our margins, both by customer and by product and by product type. So there's not a really very easy answer there. So but yes, mix is a factor, both within both IDP and mobile and between the two.","Tom Diffely","I guess on an absolute basis, a few hundred basis points variance is common? Or what kind of range would you expect inside of mobile?","Steve Buhaly","It really depends on mix. I can't give you a simple answer there. Too many parts, too many customers, too many products.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And on the BAW filter side, what's your view of the market right now, the total market, the supply\/demand equation for BAW filters?","James Klein","We still see that, of course that's one of the most exciting parts of the market growing very rapidly. We do see a lot of potential new applications for BAW. We've talked about diversity receive modules for example, the Wi-Fi integrated fusion modules in which we'll be really anchored around our BAW filter capability.","Again, working with the mobile operators, and looking out further and further we see a lot of bands that were conditionally done in SAW or TC-SAW and that may require BAW going forward because we're trying to get more throughput out of the frequency range. So all this adds up to kind of more of the same. It's one of the fastest, maybe the fastest growing part of the RF TAM for the next few years. And in terms of supply, I mean, we're just keeping up with demand. I mean, it's a very rational market right now. We have pretty good visibility into the requirements and we're keeping up, just keeping pace.","Tom Diffely","Okay. It sounds like your competitors are just keeping pace as well. So you don't get periods of gluts in the marketplace.","James Klein","That's exactly how it feels right now. It's a very good balance to demand and supply managing through a pretty high growth market pretty well.","Tom Diffely","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And Cody Acree with Ascendiant Capital.","Cody Acree","Thanks. Eric, maybe with the excess inventories in China, do you have a balanced view of 2G and3G versus LTE?","Eric Creviston","Sure. I think we're really talking about 4G here. 2G\/3G is I think we said last quarter de minimis to us, less than 5% of revenues basically. So 3G is falling off pretty rapidly in terms of units being replaced by 4G and the dollar content difference between 2G and 4G is dramatic. So really what we're talking about here is wholly 4G in our case.","Cody Acree","And are you seeing any positive or negative impacts of the base band market share shifts, particularly with some of the largest OEMs?","Eric Creviston","Long term it doesn't make that much of a difference to us. We have great opportunities on all the base bands out there, including the vertical ones and the major independent ones, of course. Now, of course, in any given quarter the mix between those bands and which customer is using them and which models you're in can definitely have a big effect. But it's not fundamentally because of the shift between base bands, it's more just mix and churn in the market and how things end at the end of a quarter.","Cody Acree","And, Steve, just any timing on the layering in of some of the larger gross margin improvements, the in-sourcing or some of the new products coming out sort of next year.","Steve Buhaly","It's a little too soon to say but right now I would just apply it ratably through the year.","Cody Acree","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Thanks, Cody.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now hear from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long","Thank you. Two questions if I could. First, any changes in the competitive landscape, particularly any traction at all with any of the CMOS players in the market. And then secondly, if you could touch on the other large vendor, Samsung, they had been a double-digit, greater than 10% customer. They are no longer, but it seems like the latest round of handsets did have more content though. Could you talk a little bit about what might be happening with the other large handset vendor? Thank you.","Eric Creviston","Yeah. This is Eric. I would be happy to. So, first of all regarding the competitive landscape, no significant difference at all and certainly no change in terms of traction with CMOS and so forth. So overall, very, very similar landscape to what we've been dealing with this year. So that's on track. The question regarding Samsung, we talked I think last quarter as well. We definitely see that as one of our greatest opportunities for growth.","We're not at all happy with our share there this year. And we've got a lot of room for growth next year. We do think even on soft to down units that the dollar content at Samsung is going to grow nicely year-over-year. So we are really lined up with our investments, fully staffed, a lot of programs to capture significant value in handsets that that customer will be launching early next year.","Tim Long","Okay. And what do you think the main challenge with Samsung for you has been this year making it a tough year?","Eric Creviston","Yeah. It's really that the architecture shift that they made going to higher levels of integrated modules did not favor RFMD and TriQuint products. And we basically missed the generation now. Of course, that's why we formed Qorvo is to fix this problem. And now those are the exact products that we're focused on and in probably the best position to gain in. So we just, they made the architecture shift a generation sooner than we thought they would. It's good news for us in the long run, but we've got to close those product gaps and get our fair share next year.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Ian Ing","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So Eric, earlier you mentioned a mix change led to some excess inventory at the China handset customers. Was that a shift between different types of SKUs or tiers?","Eric Creviston","Ian, I was referring not only to that but primarily between customers. It's pretty remarkable how volatile the actual customer share can be, the winners and losers so to speak within a quarter can change fairly significantly. And I think overall, again, we've got tremendous opportunities to grow with all these customers. But there's still a great variation between one customer to another or one model to another. So you can see this choppiness really affecting what you end up with in terms of inventory exiting the quarter.","Ian Ing","So only some China OEMs are over-inventoried right now it sounds like.","Steve Buhaly","That's our read on it exactly.","Ian Ing","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up. You talked about some co-developed parts showing up in the second half of this year. What levels of co-development are possible each model year? I think initially you're talking about multi-chip packages doing some integrations there. I mean when are full monolithic parts possible and you can do just everything potentially out there?","Eric Creviston","Well yeah, that's an interesting question. So the interesting thing about RF, and especially the way that we approached it is that each individual component has its own technology which is unique to it. So we're looking at monolithic integration as much as multi-chip module integration. Right?","Which gives us not only the best performance, but the best flexibility to really customize the parts for each individual customer. And today at Qorvo, we're very fortunate to have the broadest portfolio of those individual technologies which allows us to address virtually every single socket in the market. So we're focusing the investments on the ones where we think we got the most differentiation. Obviously BAW filters, high-performance switching and high-performance power amplifiers, envelope tracking, these are the areas where we see leadership today. We're focusing first on these modules.","We've talked a lot about the high-band RF Fusion awards in the press release. We're seeing a lot traction for that. And what's exciting is it's not just the top tier flagship guides going with that kind of Fusion which is full of capability module, but it's also going into the mid-tier and into many other handset customers and reference designs and even into China before we know it.","So that Fusion level of integration which is power amplifiers, switching, all the filters and power management, all integrated into one high-performance, small placement module. That is definitely the trend and it's certainly an opportunity-rich environment for us now to execute on that.","Ian Ing","Okay. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow back of I think you said earlier in the call that - no change to your context expectations in the second half. To the extent that you can comment - I know it's always tough. There's already pictures of your largest customers' phone. It looks like there's a high-band pad, so when you say no changes to your expectations, could you comment on what you expect your content to be at the largest customer? Because obviously China is weak for you, but that seemingly should be going well for you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Blayne, as you know, it's always difficult to talk about our largest customer. What I can tell you is that we have, between us, continued to gain share, if you could add the two companies together year-over-year-over-year. It's our current expectations this year, it's our current expectations next year.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. And then a similar comment you - the opportunity for you in the second half was to gain share. You just talked about Samsung, but also China, some of the media tech platforms and such. Does this inventory correction delay that? Or are you still able to gain some content at those customers as you look at December?","Bob Bruggeworth","Eric, do you want to take that?","Eric Creviston","Yeah. It's - I guess I haven't thought about it as a delay because in any one particular slot everything's still on track, but with the inventory and the mix shift between slots I guess you could look at that as a delay. Yeah, but not a significant change in the trajectory, just in sort of the timing of all those slots. Our content and growth opportunities on each of the platforms are still very high.","Blayne Curtis","Great. And then I want to ask you, Bob, another tough question, so don't hate me. As you look out to next year obviously for the large platforms you have to submit your parts already. How are you feeling about the road map that you have in place? Obviously the combined parts are coming together now. Did you have the right parts in place in terms of performance to continue your content gains to the largest customer?","Bob Bruggeworth","Blayne, not that tough a question so I appreciate that one. But I want to clarify my comment on the prior question. I should have said content that we expect to be able to grow our content this year and next year. And I would broaden this to not just our largest customer but many of the customers' marque phones next year is really where we get our technology road maps and capabilities between those legacy TriQuint, legacy RFMD online. So we're feeling very good about next year's models, the marquee phones that will be launched, we're very good about our positioning for those phones.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. Thanks, Bob.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Eric Creviston","Thanks, Blayne.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","A - Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call. Even as we achieve our initial synergies and deliver robust leverage, we believe Qorvo is just beginning to demonstrate what we're capable of. We're excited to build on our success as we introduce new products combining our legacy capabilities, outgrow our markets and realize the full run rate of our synergies and achieve our financial model. Thank you, and good night.","Operator","Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation."],"18357":["Qorvo, Inc.

First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks very much, Todd. Hello, everybody and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website at qorvo.com under Investors.","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; as well as other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Qorvo delivered a strong June quarter with double-digit growth both sequentially and year-over-year in revenue, EPS and free cash flow. Our strong performance was driven by several factors: First, the Qorvo team is operating extremely well which allows us to respond quickly to changing market conditions; second, Qorvo supplies industry leaders with our broad portfolio of premium products featuring award-winning quality; and third, our long-term growth drivers are very much intact, including the ramp of 5G and the proliferation of IoT.","5G has become a reality for our business. Over 50 operators have deployed 5G in the last 12 months. We are seeing new frequencies and new placements requiring premium technologies, including high band, ultra-high band and millimeter wave applications. This not only favors our BAW, GaN and other premium technologies, it rewards Qorvo's proficiency in compound semiconductors and high-performance front ends. Quite simply, we are in the right place with the right technologies at the right time.","Turning now to IDP. Qorvo continued to drive the leading edge across targeted growth markets. In defense, we won expanded orders of BAW-based solutions for U.S. DoD programs including the F-35. We released our newest GaN amplifiers for Ka-band satcom and X-band phased-array radars and we expanded GaN shipments into S-band and C-band radar programs for multiple defense customers.","For space-based applications, our wideband GaN amplifiers selected to enable low Earth orbit satellites delivering internet connectivity anywhere in the world. In infrastructure, 5G deployments continue with options for spectrum licenses proceeding on or ahead of schedule. In China, licenses originally expected to be granted this fall were issued in June. In the U.S., multiple auctions were completed for millimeter wave frequencies. Also recently in Japan, there were auctions for additional sub 6 gigahertz frequency. We are extremely well-positioned to serve 5G with a broad portfolio of products between the transceiver and the antenna.","In massive MIMO, demand for our transmit and receive components is growing in step with the content increases associated with MIMO architectures and larger array with up to 64 by 64 channels. In these applications, GaN continues to take share from LDMOS.","In IoT, we extended the frequency range of our BAW technology up to 5.9 gigahertz and commenced sampling of our newly rereleased 5 gigahertz BAW filters. We also secured key design win for our BAW-based iFEM enabling industry-leading range, throughput and signaling integrity.","Finally, we secured multiple automotive design wins for LNAs and BAW coexistence filters. We are also excited about our new programmable power management business and the integration of Active-Semi is progressing very well. We are leveraging our sales channels for these products and we continue to win with our customized IP box and programmability which enable our customers to achieve shorter time to market. We expect new trends like the adoption of brushless DC motors to support a broad range of opportunities for controlling and powering next-generation devices, smart appliances, power tools and industrial equipment.","Now turning to Mobile Products. Qorvo continued to leverage our leadership across product categories, including BAW-based solutions, envelope trackers and tuners. Similar to IDP, we are focusing our portfolio on the highest probability opportunities for growth and profitability. As 5G ramps, we are enjoying increased customer interest in BAW-based solutions, including high band pads, hexaplexers, coexistence filters and antennaplexers. 5G devices bring additional frequency band challenges and require enhanced 4G performance, including multiplexing and antennaplexing.","5G devices also plays a greater emphasis on 100 megahertz envelope tracking and they require a more complex antenna tuning. All of these requirements favor Qorvo's unique technologies, expanding product portfolio and years of experience in higher frequency applications.","During the quarter, we received orders from newly released BAW-based antennaplexers. We also commenced shipments of our BAW-based band 1, 3, 7 hexaplexers to multiple Chinese-based smartphone OEMs, enabling higher orders of carrier aggregation for their export market. In addition, we also secured the entire main path, combining our low, high and ultrahigh band solutions at leading China-based smartphone OEM for an upcoming 5G smartphone. Finally, we are awarded our first design win for programmable 5G antenna tuners capable of performing aperture and impedance tuning.","Before I finish, I'd like to make a few comments about Huawei. Now if there was a place on the BIS entity list, I, along with other members of our senior management team met multiple times with government officials and we worked closely with industry leaders and counsel to understand and address the impact on our business. Ultimately, we were able to begin shipments of certain products late in the quarter and we have applied for a license to expand the products we can sell. Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications companies and an important participant in our industry. We will continue to support them consistent with all applicable legal requirements. Finally, as our June quarter and September guidance demonstrate, we are effectively navigating a challenging environment and our products and technology continue to support solid sustainable results. We are confident our opportunities will continue to expand as 5G ramps and IoT proliferates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide additional color on our June quarter and our outlook for September. Mark?","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the first quarter was $776 million, $36 million above the midpoint of our May 21 guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected mobile demand. Roughly half of the favorable revenue variance in the quarter was from the shipment of select products to Huawei in June which commenced following an extensive legal review.","Sales to Huawei were 22% of total revenue in the June quarter compared to approximately 14% during the same period last year and 15% for our full year fiscal 2019. For the June quarter, mobile revenue of $556 million was driven by double-digit year-over-year growth with several of our top customers. IDP grew year-over-year to over $219 million due primarily to higher demand for infrastructure products.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the June quarter was 46.2%, 70 basis points above our guidance due to favorable mix and manufacturing productivity gains. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $168 million, below our guidance on lower personnel costs and effective cost control measures.","Non-GAAP net income in the June quarter was $165 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.36, $0.21 over the midpoint of our guidance and up 42% year-over-year. June quarter cash flow from operations was $257 million on higher income and favorable working capital effects. CapEx was $50 million resulting in free cash flow of $207 million, a record level for the company in the first quarter. This free cash flow performance reflects our improved operating capabilities and ongoing capital discipline.","During the quarter, we completed the purchase of Active-Semi International, adding rapidly growing power management opportunities to our diversified IDP portfolio. Both the integration and business plans are on track. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter and we modestly increased net debt.","Turning to our outlook. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue between $745 million and 600 -- $765 million, or $755 million at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 46% to 46.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30 at the midpoint of our guidance.","Our revenue outlook for the September quarter reflects typical seasonal ramps at our largest customer, offset by a significantly lower sales to Huawei compared to the June quarter. For the full fiscal year, we currently project our sales to Huawei will fall below 10% of Qorvo's total sales. Although we have filed for a license and are taking other proactive steps to address our ability to sell products to Huawei, the scope, duration and long-term financial impact of the restrictions remain unclear and difficult to predict.","For IDP, we project September quarter sales to decline due to these restrictions. But recover through the year as the infrastructure market picks up with other customers and Wi-Fi and other markets strengthen. For mobile, we expect September quarter sales to increase sequentially with higher revenues from seasonal ramps offset in part by significantly lower sales to Huawei. For the fiscal year, we project mobile to be down approximately 10% second half compared to first half due to trade effects and seasonality.","On gross margin, our September quarter guide of 46% to 46.5% is roughly flat compared to the June quarter. Lower volumes enhance weaker-than-previously forecasted utilization are weighing in on gross margins.","Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to decrease slightly in the September quarter to around $166 million as cost control benefits are offset by investments in growth programs and the full quarter addition of the Programmable Power Management business. We expect OpEx to remain below $170 million per quarter for the rest of the fiscal year.","We expect the September quarter and fiscal '20 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 8.5%. On capital expenditures, we are projecting spend of less than $200 million this fiscal year as we continue to be highly disciplined on adding capacity. Spend remains weighted towards improving our BAW and GaN capabilities.","The June quarter was challenging with the abrupt disruption of sales to an important customer and other evolving market conditions. But Qorvo responded well and delivered a strong quarter of double-digit year-over-year sales growth and record first quarter earnings and free cash flow. Certain aspects of our markets remain unclear so we are taking a measured view.","Specifically, as it relates to Huawei, we have reduced our outlook to include only modest sales of Mobile Products. On the infrastructure side of the business, we expect a pickup in business from other customers but this will take time and we have a recovery in IDP modeled in the second half of our fiscal year.","As we demonstrated this quarter, we have the products, technologies and operating capabilities to help navigate these evolving market conditions.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Chris Caso of Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","I guess the first question on Huawei. Perhaps you could clarify the types of components that you're permitted to ship, which components you're not, where you're trying to get the licenses? And then with respect to what you're shipping now, perhaps you could talk about with what your shipping in the September quarter, how that compares to what you have been shipping on a dollar basis to Huawei in the beginning of the year so we can sort of calibrate the -- that exchange?","Robert Bruggeworth","I'll take the first part. Mark, if you want to take the second part. I think in the opening comments; you gave them a little bit about that. Chris, thanks for your question. Let me start with the export regulations are extremely complex. The companies like ours with global supply chains, where those shipments of particular products are restricted depends on a variety of factors including builds and materials, manufacturing flows for each component, things like that. It really requires a detailed part by part analysis. And unfortunately, I think it goes beyond the scope of this call to go into a lot more detail.","I will tell you, before turning in any of the parts that we are now able to ship, we do a very detailed analysis as appropriate, consulting outside counsel, get legal advice, even work with government officials for guidance on the export rules. And as Mark has said in his opening comments, this is an ongoing process.","So those parts that we don't feel comply as we commented, both Mark and I, we have applied, with the encouragement of the U.S. government officials, applied for a license from the Bureau of Export Enforcement to expand the number of parts we can ship for both mobile and IDP. As of now, I don't believe the U.S. government has issued any licenses so far. So for us to predict or even estimate when licenses will be granted will be extremely difficult.","In the case of the Mobile Products, it's been clear that some of those products we can actually ship in volume. As it goes for IDP, we've cleared some products but the shipments have been extremely limited in volume and in dollars. So I hope Chris, that gives you an idea of what we are able to ship.","Mark Murphy","Yes. So Chris, I just -- I think I provided enough detail in my opening comments. But just to may be provide more directly here. We sold $172 million of product to Huawei in the first quarter. The vast majority of that was pre-ban. As I said in my opening comments, roughly half or about $18 million of our variance to our guide was Huawei post-ban. We would see levels about that level. So certainly, less than 5% of our sales is what we have modeled going forward and that would be principally mobile.","Christopher Caso","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess with the uncertainty going forward on whether or not you would be able to get licenses, perhaps you could address what you're -- what the risk would be of ultimately being designed out permanently if not just for perhaps Huawei trying to reduce exposure to U.S. vendors or perhaps, they would have to? And I guess in other words, what are the substitutes for what you can provide to Huawei? Are there substitutes available? How difficult is this? And therefore, kind of how sticky is -- are your design wins despite all of the restrictions that are in place?","Robert Bruggeworth","Let me take a shot at that, Chris. That's a pretty complicated story to answer. Number one is you all know they're having trouble competing outside of China. So those designs are actually were picking up another customer. So I'll make my comments somewhat to the China market. In those design wins that we already had; we are keeping those. We are also picking up design wins on those parts that we can continue to ship for them.","I think the thing I'd like to point out is we supply premium technologies. And customers like Huawei and other customers from around the world like our technologies. So I'm not sure I'm in a position to comment at Huawei's product strategy or their supply chain. That's a great question for them, to be quite candid. As Mark said, we've modeled out for you what we think we can gain and what's in for the fiscal year. So I don't know how much more I can add. What I do believe is if we do are granted a license, we will be able to continue to expand our design wins and grow our business.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bill Peterson of J.P. Morgan.","William Peterson","My first question is in mobile. Certainly I hate to bring up the Qualcomm thing again, it talks about a lot more design wins with the vast majority using the RF. On the other hand, you also have discussed winning the RFs in the Chinese customer, which I assume would be Huawei in fact. But I guess can you give us an update on your 5G engagements, your design win pipeline for phones? And especially phones that use Qualcomm motors that are going to be launched later this year and into 2020. I guess where are you seeing the most traction in the new sub-6-GHz? And I guess they talked about reported advantages of designing around the antenna. How should we think about them as a competitor as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months?","Steven Creviston","Sure, Bill. This is Eric. So we are seeing an acceleration really in 5G activity throughout China, certainly not just Huawei, but all of our leading handset customers in China. A lot of excitement about the rollout and it's definitely accelerating, as Bob mentioned in his opening comments, both in terms of licenses and infrastructure rollout. But in terms of all the exciting new devices that are coming out. So we are seeing broad-based activity across all customers and across our entire product family. Certainly antenna management, advanced power management and highly integrated modules covering low, mid, high and ultrahigh band frequencies. So it's a very active design cycle.","Now we do see multiple 5G basebands ramping. And of course Qualcomm is doing well there. We do see large opportunities for content shipping on all the base bands including Qualcomm.","William Peterson","Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess based -- this is a question on IDP. We saw sequential decline here in the June quarter and you're calling for that again in September, followed by improvement in the back half. I guess all that in, how should we think about growth for IDP this year? And I guess specifically, amongst infrastructure versus Wi-Fi and defense and so forth?","Robert Bruggeworth","So let me talk a lot about current quarter. We did have a strong base station quarter in the current quarter and we are well-positioned with most of the major OEMs. That strength has come because of 5G deployments, to follow-up on Eric, because we are seeing strong demand from massive MIMO products and we do see GaN continuing to take slots particularly in those massive MIMO slots. So base station did have a strong quarter.","As far as projecting out further, we have experienced several weak quarters of our IoT particularly our Wi-Fi part of that business. We believe that still delays associated with the rollout of AX and a little bit to do with trade activities and repositioning of supply chains. We had a very strong design win quarter in that part of the business. So we are starting to see indications that we are coming out of that and that we should have a strong back half. So we are expecting that back half.","And we also have talked in the past about our defense business being a bit lumpy. But it does look like we are positioned to have a very strong back half in the defense business. On top of that, Bill, I think we are starting to see some early indications of the infrastructure business, the supply chain starting to adjust. We are -- we do have some of our other customers that will begin ramps soon with massive MIMO products and that will start to fill in a bit. Predominantly though, the decline that we've experienced this quarter and next quarter are associated with our lack of ability to ship to Huawei.","Mark Murphy","Bill, maybe just to help a bit with the profile of IDP. Clearly had a sequential decline in the June quarter. We expect another sequential decline in the September quarter. Expect the business to return to sequential growth in the December quarter. As it relates to year-over-year, the business still grew in June despite the issues with Huawei. However, in the September quarter, we do expect a decline year-over-year for IDP and then IDP returning to growth in the back half year-over-year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Raji Gill of Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","I appreciate it. I just wanted to get a sense from you in terms of are you seeing any competitive solutions for your HBT solutions and your FinFET from Asian customers? We've seen some commentary out of some FE houses that are qualifying and ramping with new Asian customers. I'm just wondering if that -- if you're seeing any competition from your main products as it relates to the China trade war and any risk in China trying to in-source where possible?","Steven Creviston","This is Eric. At least I can speak for the mobile business. We sell very few discrete power amplifiers or HPT solutions. The vast majority of what we are selling is combined modules that include filter and advanced switching capabilities. So at least I haven't seen a competitive element there with the GaAs HPT supply.","Rajvindra Gill","Okay. And on the 5G side, there has been one competitor who basically indicated that there would be a little bit of a pause with regards to China, the build out in 5G, after a lot of deployment or a lot of orders of massive MIMO deployments. But that seems to differ from what you're saying in terms of China's ramp. Just wanted to get a sense, has there been an overbuild perhaps or is there other factors?","Robert Bruggeworth","This is Bob, I'll go and take that. From our conversations with carriers there and what all you can see; I don't think there's been a slowdown in base stations. In fact, there's another round coming out for an even larger RFQ for additional base stations late this year, I think it's November. So we are not seeing any slowdown in the rollout on the infrastructure side.","Operator","We will take our next question from Carl Curtis of Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","May be just on the Huawei impact of $172 million, is there any way to kind of gauge how much of that impact is IDP? I'm just trying to understand these moving pieces. I know you said the base stations had a good quarter. So I assume that in June even though you stopped shipping to Huawei partially in the quarter, that business was still up. I'm just trying to understand.","Steven Creviston","Yes. In the June quarter, base stations still had nice growth year-over-year, well into the double-digit range. And so the other end of the question, as far as amount of revenue by business units split out, we don't split it out.","Mark Murphy","We don't provide that.","Steven Creviston","Details down that level by business unit.","Blayne Curtis","Got you. And maybe I could ask you the other way, you're looking for some slight growth at mobile into September. You talked about seasonal ramps. Can you maybe give us a little more color as to where you're getting that growth? And obviously, a part of Huawei, you're offsetting there, so I'm just kind of curious if you can talk geography -- by geography or whatever color you can provide will be helpful.","Steven Creviston","Sure. This is Eric. The growth in mobile in September quarter is driven by normal seasonality of flagship ramps going into the second half across multiple top-tier customers. And again, it's muted significantly then by the Huawei sequential effect.","Operator","We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I was hoping to better understand your September quarter revenue guide on a year-over-year basis a little bit better. I think if we take the midpoint of your guide, your revenue is expected to be down about $130 million. How much of that is Huawei? How much of that is your biggest customer in the U.S.? Active-Semi obviously is up. I'm assuming non-Huawei IDP is up. If you kind of walk through some of the pluses and minuses on a year-over-year basis, that will be helpful. Then I have a follow-up.","Robert Bruggeworth","This is Bob. I'll take it on a high-level. I mean, primarily in our largest customer, we are roughly flat year-over-year. Huawei is the largest part and we are down a little bit in China. If you remember last year at this time, we talked about the China market was doing extremely well and we were taking a conservative view on it which was accurate. So in essence, it's Huawei and China.","Mark Murphy","Yes, over 2\/3 of it is Huawei, Toshiya","Toshiya Hari","Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, Mark, in terms of gross margins, you guys are guiding September essentially flat sequentially despite IDP being down sequentially and the seasonal ramp in mobile is typically dilutive to gross margin. So I guess there must be some operational improvements going on beneath the surface. So if you can kind of speak to some of those points. And more importantly, I guess going forward into the back half of the fiscal year, before the Huawei ban, you guys have talked about sequential improvements and hitting 48% for the full year. I'm assuming that's no longer the case. But if you can talk about your expectations going into the second half, that will be helpful.","Mark Murphy","Yes, it's a good question, Toshiya. So we are absolutely undertaking, obviously, all the productivity efforts we can. And we are making great progress. I mean, the disappointment here is that we were set up for a very good year on gross margin and there is a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue hit that we've taken versus our May 7 guidance has really reduced the utilization in the factory network.","I addressed gross margin on the May 7 call. And as you said, I said we expected the gross margin being about 48% for the full year. Right now, we did beat in the June quarter by 70 basis points. As you mentioned, I guided the September to be largely flat. That's the negative utilization effect offset by productivity gains and then some positive mix effects. Now for the full year, our view at the moment is between 46% and 47% gross margin.","Operator","We will take our next question from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Eric, there's a lot of talk about substitutes for your off-components in China, I'm sure you've gotten tired of the question. But our own ship level teardown of Huawei's latest phones, it looks like it's Full Filter, Amp, Switch Modules and envelope trackers for you and modules and tuners for Skyworks. First of all, are any of the advanced phones coming out of China from many of the OEMs moving back to the street architecture or are they all kind of moving to this same kind of basic high integrated modules that Apple's been using for years?","And secondly, when you're moving to 5G, especially in regard to the antenna and some of the interface between these two, does this become more acute or less acute as you're trying to handle all the new bands? And then James, if I could, real quick, it sounds like your defense is on the tear in the second half of the year. Is that primarily gains due to GaN on new slots and is defense now back to being the largest group?","Robert Bruggeworth","Eric, do you want to take the first part?","Steven Creviston","Sure. So regarding the architectures at our leading customers in China, certainly outside of Huawei, the trend is clear. The acceleration of 5G is driving even more demand for higher levels of integration, trying to get the LTE Advanced Pro packed in the smallest possible. We have had several customers that have actually added bands to their 5G platforms as we were late in the development cycle. They're adding even more of the ultrahigh bands in there to address more carrier requirements and so forth. So that only drives towards -- to the first part of your question, more integration.","And into the second part of your question, yes, it's definitely becoming more acute, more difficult to manage the antenna interface with all the new bands being added on top of everything that was in there before. So we don't see anything other than an acceleration of all the trends we've been talking about for a couple of years now. And if anything, even more confidence in the TAM expansion next year.","Robert Bruggeworth","So as far as defense, yes, the businesses is striking and poise to have a really great back half. It's pretty broad-based growth but I would say GaN is basically playing a much larger role there. And so most of the growth I think will come from our GaN-based products. Really, broad-based both domestic, international platforms and across a broad range of frequencies. You saw that we have product wins down in the S and C-band but also up in X and all the way up in the millimeter wave frequencies.","As far as being the largest product line, I'm thoroughly guided all that level. But yes, probably towards the end of the year, it will be at close if not the largest business segment that we've got inside IDP.","Edward Snyder","Great. And then Mark, if I could, real quick. I know utilization is down obviously because your revenue is down here. We used to talk a year or so ago about BAW. There's a lot of competitors talking about BAW, Skyworks was mentioned several times. Qualcomm's brought investors to last quarter, talking up BAW and winning all that stuff. So maybe you can give us an update if you could on just your position in that area as regard to Richardson? I know your utilization is going to be down here, but are we talking higher than what it was earlier this year? Any kind of profile at all on how much either utilization has come out Richardson on BAW or what percentage of revenue you expect to be seeing from BAW filters?","Mark Murphy","Yes. I think, Ed, what I would say is that we are confident in our operations plan in Texas. We've done a lot of things there to position that plant, Richardson along with Farmers branch to be a tremendous asset for us going forward and we believe it will be. Yes, this revenue hit we've had was particularly hard because we were seeing a lot of BAW activity around Phase 6 and there were some other product movement that is going to lower utilization rates in Texas for the next year or so. But we see, yes, the same trends continuing that Eric talked about, increased complexity, you have the density of the RF modules and more stringent requirements on bands and so forth. So we see, in the product roadmaps we have, a greater use of BAW and we see utilization improving in the levels we'd like to see it beyond this year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava","I have a quick one for you, Mark. Actually, I have two for you. The quick one is was there any Active-Semi in the reported quarter? You said that IDP was higher on a year-over-year basis. But does that include any Active-Semi. And my follow-up is very strong free cash flow in the reported quarter. It's -- I know it's very uncertain and thanks for trying to give as much clarity as you guys can, so really appreciate that. But would you be able to provide us with a guidance on free cash flow for the full year?","Mark Murphy","Yes. On free cash flow for the year, we do believe we will have free cash flow growth for the year. Combination of sustaining decent income despite this sales drop relative to our previous view. We are exhibiting good cost control, good working capital management and good CapEx discipline and expect to see free cash flow growth. First question.","Ambrish Srivastava","Active-Semi.","Mark Murphy","Active-Semi. There was Active-Semi in the IDP business, Ambrish. It was a small amount. IDP still grew year-over-year if you exclude that.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ruben Roy of Benchmark.","Ruben Roy","I had a quick follow-up, a quick clarification for Eric. Eric, you mentioned either working with or having design wins with the various baseband manufacturers for 5G. I'm wondering if you can clarify, you said you had design wins out there in actual handsets with the group of folks that have 5G modem technology. And then also wondering about the qualification process. How does that work? Is that qualification for your RFs by baseband manufacturer or by that handset OEM or a combination?","Steven Creviston","Sure. Yes, just to reiterate, we can confirm that we have design wins, and in fact in production with 5G content across multiple basebands in China including Qualcomm. And the process, as it works today, really, we are in the leadership position of defining a lot of the RF content and placements and interfaces and so forth. So the integration happens largely between RF's team and our customers directly.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","I had two actually. For the first one, I think Bob, you mentioned Huawei was about 22% of sales and that is including the disruption. I'm curious how much would that have been without the disruption? Because it just seems a very high number. Did you sense that there was kind of pull forward of sales into June? Because I realize, I think for September, you're saying is going to be less than 5%. I'm just trying to understand how it was such a large number for your June quarter?","Robert Bruggeworth","I think, Vivek, if you remember last quarter when I talked about Huawei, they grew their share in the first quarter of 50%. And if you actually look at a lot of what's been published this last quarter, I think they drove their share even more in China from 31% to about 38%. So they were taking significant share. I'll also remind you last quarter, we talked about that our business was growing with Huawei. We were gaining back share that as you recall we didn't price our ETP mix low and we knew we were going to miss a generation. We thought it was right, it was right. So they were gaining share, we were gaining share. Remember last year, we were 15%. So 22% doesn't seem like a big number to me. And to answer your question, yes, it would've been more. But they're taking share. We were taking share. It was a great story.","Vivek Arya","Got it. Makes sense. And then Bob for my follow-up, how much RF content are you seeing in the 5G phones in China? And when you look at the design, is it a winner take all kind of approach or is it that your share in those 5G phones is similar to the share you had in the broad 4G market which was in the 20%, 25% range or so? Just how much is the RF content and the lift you're seeing and how is the share -- your share doing in those designs?","Steven Creviston","Vivek, this is Eric. I'll take that. It is, at this point in time, exceeding our expectations. As I said, even more bands are being added sooner than we expected. And so we are confident in what we've been saying at least $1 billion in TAM expansion next year driven by 5G which includes not only the new 5G bands but also upgrades to the 4G part of the phone to be compatible with that. So all told, we are expecting at least $1 billion of TAM expansion.","When you look at that at the handset level, some of the sort of higher tier within that tier 5G handsets that are coming out of China can routinely have $10 to $15 worth of RF content. And we are definitely getting our fair share. I think there are various models but it does seem that our share of the total RF will be expanding as we add 5G.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christopher Rolland of SIG.","Christopher Rolland","Back to the Huawei at 22%, that was some great color on them gaining share there. I guess that means that most of that revenue contribution was from handsets and not sort of a large spike in infrastructure there. Is it kind of your opinion that that was actually natural demand, not an inventory building on their part?","Robert Bruggeworth","Yes, Chris, that's a good point. The growth that we saw quarter-over-quarter at Huawei also was for a lot of the IDP massive MIMO which is our GaN plus, our high performance GaAs process. So that was a portion of it. I took Vivek's question more on the handset side, so I apologize for that. But no, we saw a very nice growth in that side of the business where in my opening comments I talked about how GaN is taking share from LDMOS and that's a very good example of one of the customers were doing that. And as James alluded to and Mark in his comments, we are taking some of that same technology now and we've been working with other customers and they're just ramping behind where Huawei was. It's not we moved resources; Huawei was clearly leading. We were the leader who's adopting the technology. That did drive a large part of our growth and a larger percentage of Huawei being for the total company.","Christopher Rolland","Got it. And I guess playing into those infrastructure comments as well. As we look at HPRF and when we move from 4G to 5G, there's definitely new players here and new materials as you kind of move away from LDMOS as well. Any idea of who your biggest competitors are in 5G? And any early indications on what you think your share of that market is?","Steven Creviston","Well, I mean first of all, we do definitely see MIMO architecture starting to get more and more share away from macro. So we talked about that trend last quarter. And I think that trend still continues. And in fact, a number of MIMO channels will probably eclipse macro channels this year. And then a percentage of base stations are certainly trending in awards, the number is probably 30% or so being macro -- being massive MIMO base stations.","As far as competitors, we really compete at all of the major OEMs for the entire RF chain, both receive side and all the way through transmit side. And so each component is a bit different depending on what individual company's strengths are. Among the power amplifier side, it's predominantly been a competition between the LDMOS conventional players and then the few of those that have GaN capability. And as Bob talked about, that transition to GaN is going fairly rapidly, moving away from LDMOS and into GaN","Operator","We will take our next question from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","You've mentioned the traction in the Samsung A series and just curious kind of as you think about kind of the mid-tier portfolio there, kind of where you are today and how that could progress as you go forward?","Steven Creviston","Sure. Thank you. That's -- it's a really exciting story for us and we are really excited what the team's been able to do there to work closely with that key customer. We had been out of that series really for several generations as we focus more on the flagship tier and they were going with less integrated solutions for the most part in that mass tier in the A series. So working with them on architectures and so forth over a couple of years, you're seeing the culmination of that now where they're beginning to look at just like all the rest of our customers looking at moving up the integration curve and adopting new technologies and things which align with our portfolio really well. So this is the first step into it. We've been present there all along in antenna tuning of course. But this gets us into the main path in some of the medium or chunkier bits of revenue in that tier.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks. And just a follow-up question from Mark on the back of the strong free cash flow. How are you thinking about kind of buybacks versus potential tuck-ins like Active-Semi?","Mark Murphy","Yes, we continue to -- nothing's changed. We've been generating strong free cash flow. We will continue to look for bolt-ons for James' business and technology buys for Eric's business. As we said, thrilled to have the Active-Semi team in Qorvo and immediately contributing this quarter. And the integration is going well and plans are on track.","To the extent we don't have opportunities, I've been clear about our leverage targets. We did tick up a bit and we continue to be buyers of the stock at these levels but I'm not going to comment on rate base.","Operator","We will take our next question from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison","With the Farmers branch closure and the other -- or the Farmers branch I guess coming back online potentially next year versus the weaker mobile demand, does that cause some linger further into fiscal '21? And then also does the weaker mobile demand affect kind of the savings coming back as you consolidate facilities?","Mark Murphy","The plans are right now still to have the facility contributing operationally in fiscal '21. In this sort of slower volume, we've taken the opportunity, I think we've talked about it a couple of times before to look at the plant configuration in a different way. So we are able to do what we thought would be more capital before with a lot less to achieve higher levels of capacity in the future. So we feel great about the facilities and capabilities we have in Texas. Great team and good leadership down there and we see that utilization improving over the next 1.5 years.","Shawn Harrison","And then as a brief follow-up, considering all the 5G phone launches that could come out in calendar '20, how does that affect typical March quarter seasonality in mobile? I know it's been over the place the past few years. But do you see muted March quarter seasonality with new phone launches and 5G coming in?","Mark Murphy","Yes. We are not going to get in too much detail on the quarters right now that far out. I mean, it's a very difficult year to predict. I will take the opportunity to mention that on the May 7 call, we gave a view that we thought revenue would be up 4% year-over-year in fiscal '20. A lot has changed since then. And there is the Huawei ban, there's other items that have impacted our outlook. So it's -- we're a few hundred million off on where we were on that view. Now it's a tough year to predict. And if the trade situation improves and handset releases are maybe better than we think, if 5G experience some demand -- or spur some demand and Wi-Fi 6 adoption accelerates, we could be better than that. But we are sizing for that more conservative outlook right now.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Not sure if you talked about in the second half, if you're seeing any inventory issues in China on the handset side or how the revenue profile in the December quarter looks?","Robert Bruggeworth","This is Bob, I'll go and take that. I think the last two quarters; we've talked about our own channel and how components are at -- from the days of supply historically low and they've remained that way. So we think the channel is pretty healthy. And most of the phones that are sold in China actually don't go through carriers. It's in their own stores actually. So from what we hear from them, it doesn't appear anything is building up.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And just when you look at the complete landscape, I know we talked about the trade war and stuff. Huawei has probably been building a lot of some of the RF components I believe in-house from the HiSilicon side. Do you think with the continued tensions that they could source more of that in-house? It looks like some of the sourcing is almost up to 30% on the RF side from the HiSilicon supply base. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are.","Robert Bruggeworth","James, can you address your infrastructure business and HiSilicon? I'm not aware of any.","James Klein","Yes, I mean, we don't see inside HiSilicon direct manufacturing. They're still relying on the very similar supply base to the rest of the OEMs. Of course, our ability to get U.S. components is significantly different today. But for the most part, they're relying on very similar supply chain on the RF side.","Operator","We will take our next question from Karl Ackerman of Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","If I could go back to 5G infrastructure for a moment, you have a great portfolio. But you discussed the order progression for your massive MIMO and revenue opportunity that you see in fiscal '20 and fiscal '21. If we exclude China-based network operators, I guess it is less than half of your prior view of the $600 million to $700 million for fiscal 2020? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert Bruggeworth","Sure. James?","James Klein","Well, first, I'm not going to guide by individual company. So I mean we do see early rollouts going on in China. And as Bob talked about that earlier, we see that being on pace. There are multiple suppliers in China that will be buying for that business, competing for that business. I think the U.S. will follow with the rollouts and then likely to go into Europe and other places. Most of that commentary was below 6 gigahertz and we also see millimeter wave activity continuing to ramp up in the United States with demos on most of the carriers going on in multiple cities around the country.","Karl Ackerman","Appreciate that. For my follow-up if I may, there have been several M&A announcements where companies have sought to acquire assets tangential to your own portfolio such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. And when we think about your desire to diversify beyond mobile, I'd love to hear your thoughts on capturing adjacent content areas within Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications.","Robert Bruggeworth","James, you already competing with Bluetooth.","James Klein","We did the acquisition a couple of years ago and -- of GreenPeak and we've integrated that into our business and we continue to see that business doing well and I talked about IoT in the past. I think we see a significant amount of demand. And we offer a chipset there that really offers our customers the ability to be somewhat agnostic standards or to try to resolve down to probably a few standards that will compete in that place. And that's continues to be an area that I think we remain interested in adding capability in the company and will continue to look for acquisitions in that space.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Douglas DeLieto","We thank everyone for joining us tonight. We hope to see many of you at our upcoming investor conferences and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call. Thanks again and have a good night.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks a lot, Matt. Hello everyone and welcome to Qorvo's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com, under Investors.","In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up.","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Steve Buhaly, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure & Defense Products Group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call. Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million, consistent with our pre-announcement issued January 7th. Gross margin and operating margin held in at 47.9% and 25.3% respectively. Operating expenses were down sequentially, reflecting less variable compensation expense and seasonally lower spending. Qorvo generated approximately $156.5 million in free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of stock to enhance shareholder value.","In infrastructure and defense, revenue increased sequentially with improved performance in Wireless Infrastructure. We expect this business to recover further in the near-term, reinforcing our top line growth opportunities in calendar 2016. Our IDP team continues to sharpen its focus on the highest-growth segments in its diversified business portfolio. This focus drives alignment with the growth markets of the Internet of Things, connected home, connected car and the high-growth segments within aerospace and defense.","By leveraging Qorvo's comprehensive product and technology portfolio, we are providing customers highly differentiated solutions, especially exciting in the growth rate of GaN solutions into many of IDP's key market segments, driving a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25% for the next few years. We expect growth rates in 2016 to be well above IDP's underlying markets and significantly above the legacy growth rates of our pre-merger multi-market organizations.","In mobile, the increasing global demand for broadband data and always-on connectivity continues to trigger a dramatic increase in the requirements for mobile networks and connected devices. For smartphone manufacturers and network operators, it's become increasingly difficult to capitalize on this demand while also solving new challenges related to frequency crowding, as carrier signals are aggregated, distinct bands and protocols are operated in narrowly adjacent frequency bands, and popular new consumer applications increase the congestion on our networks.","For all these reasons, it's increasingly clear that the most effective solutions available to network operators and device manufacturers are better performing, more highly-integrated RF solutions. In fact, if you were to examine the product designs in development for tomorrow's networks and devices, you'd identify an increasing requirement for world-class filters, switches, tuners and amplifiers, all tightly packaged in system-level implementations.","This is tilting the competitive playing field in Qorvo's favor. Said another way, the RF suppliers with today's best performing, most tightly integrated solutions are at the forefront of the most challenging and most lucrative customer designs this year, next year, and extending well into 2018. As customers increasingly require more tightly-integrated, high performance system-level solutions, this is favoring Qorvo's comprehensive portfolio of premium products. In fact, this is why we became Qorvo.","Now, one year into the creation of Qorvo, the roughly 7,000 members of the Qorvo team have much to be proud of. Looking at our first full year, compared to calendar 2014, revenue grew 12%. Gross margin expanded more than 400 basis points, and operating income increased more than 40%. In fact, the non-GAAP earnings we reported over the last four quarters equates to a little over $4.60 per share based on our Q3 share count of approximately 144 million shares.","On the design front, Qorvo is growing our dollar content in the most highly-anticipated marquee smartphones launching this year at our three largest mobile customers. It's worth pointing out that in December, we released the industry's first six-inch temp-comp SAW wafers in our Florida fab, qualified six-inch SAW wafers in our Greensboro fab, and demonstrated our first eight-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab. We can't overstate how important these achievements are. We see our six-inch SAW capacity contributing to growth and profitability in the current year, and we see our eight-inch BAW capacity doing the same in 2017.","We've commenced shipments of our recently launch BAW-based quadplexers for FDD bands 1 and 3, an industry first. And we demonstrated BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. We've also been selected to support a number of key cellular platforms with our next-generation Envelope Tracking PMIC. We've commenced production shipments in support of a large global smartphone OEM and have landed a number of large-scale wins layering on later this year.","We've also recently expanded our shipments of antenna control solutions into the China smartphone market. Previously, Qorvo's antenna tuners and impedance tuners had been highly concentrated within a small number of high-volume marquee devices. So we're thrilled to be increasing our addressable market in China as these customers add RF functionality to support their expanding presence in the worldwide market.","In IDP, December was an exceptionally strong design win quarter. Here's some of the highlights. We captured multiple key design wins for macro and small cell base station applications. We believe network capacity constraints will accelerate the adoption of small cell base stations and massive MIMO active antennas. Massive MIMO active antenna systems are driving a 10x increase in RF content in next-generation base stations. We continue to work on capturing new design wins as the market shifts from 4G LTE to LTE-A, LTE-Pro and eventually 5G.","At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, we supplied a suite of critical microwave components for a 5G massive MIMO demonstration performed by a leading base station OEM. The demo featured Qorvo phase shifters, power amplifiers and switches. We also expanded our presence in the connected home with key design wins in gateways and access points, highlighted by our design wins in flagship products at both NETGEAR and LINKSYS. We continue to believe that the rapidly increasing number of connected devices represented by the Internet of Things will be IDP's largest growth engine.","In defense, we are market leader in GaN, and we continue to experience strong growth with our GaN-based products. For example, we secured a multi-year win on a next-generation electronic warfare system using our patented Spatium solid state RF power technology with GaN MMICs with hundreds of system installations anticipated over the life of the contract.","On the synergy front, we continue to be on target to achieve our goals, the largest of which include the increased in-sourcing of module assembly and increased in-sourcing of SAW filters. So for Qorvo, across all our businesses, we believe industry fundamentals remain strong. We are leveraging our comprehensive product portfolio of world-class RF solutions, rapidly introducing new products and technologies, expanding into the new serviceable markets, and enjoying very favorable design win activity. We are growing our dollar content at our three largest mobile customers in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones being released this year, and we anticipate strong growth in IDP.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob. In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million, due to a lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $130 million.","Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 42% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei.","Gross margin was 47.9%, down sequentially from 49.7%. The sequential decline reflects lower yields in inventory adjustments. Operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the December quarter, down $17 million sequentially. The decline was driven by reduced accruals for bonus expense and seasonally lower spending. Operating income was $156.9 million, or just over 25% of revenue. Net income for the December quarter was $148 million, or $1.03 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and investments were over $1 billion, and cash flow from operations totaled $218 million. CapEx was $62 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million and has $750 million remaining in its share repurchase program.","We're proud of Qorvo's first full year performance and excited about the opportunities in the coming year. We're introducing an expanded set of new products, combining switches and filters, and leveraging our broad set of competencies, including BAW filter and gallium nitride process technologies. All of this is creating exciting new growth opportunities for Qorvo.","With the first full year of Qorvo now in the books, I'm pleased to report the company exceeded its targets for achievement of an exit run rate of $75 million in synergies and is on track for the previously committed $150 million run rate reduction by the end of calendar 2016. The largest remaining task is migration of all mobile segment parts to the company's China-based assembly and test facilities.","Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending April 2. Quarterly revenue of approximately $600 million, gross margin of about 50%, net interest expense of about $15 million, tax rate at approximately 3%, and diluted earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95 based on approximately 142 million shares.","Our March revenue expectations are slightly below our pre-announcement, reflecting an overall conservative posture, given the cautious environment, as well as the timing of new product ramps. We think calendar 2016 will be a strong year for Qorvo, during which we will continue to make progress on our target operating model, while building a robust and defensible technology moat. Actual quarter results may differ from these expectations and as such \u2013 and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report March quarter results on May 4th.","Now on a personal note, I'm turning 60 at the end of this year, and I've always had it as a personal goal to retire by that point. December also fortuitously marks the end of our second year as Qorvo, and I'm proud to say we're on track to achieve the goals we have set for our first two-year period. It's been a pleasure being part of Qorvo, and helping to shape its course. The company is on a fantastic trajectory, and I'm really looking forward to helping with the transition to new CFO and participating in the company's success over the balance of the year before moving on to more personal pursuits.","With that, I'm going to hand the call back to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Before opening the call to questions, I want to take a moment to thank Steve for the invaluable role he's played in creating Qorvo. Steve has been instrumental in shaping our organization. He's helped put Qorvo on a very solid financial footing, and he's assembled an outstanding finance organization.","The entire Qorvo team is stronger as a result of his contribution, and we are all very happy for him, as he looks to spend more time with his family and friends. Until then he'll play a major role in the selection of his successor and will continue to serve as Qorvo's CFO while the transition to that successor is completed.","And with that, operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we'll take the first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Bob, when I look at your implied fiscal 2016 sales growth it was modest, and we all know because of the demand weakness around your largest customer. My question is that as we look out to fiscal 2017, how fast do you think the total \u2013 your addressable market can grow, and do you think you can match that growth?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. FY 2016, as you pointed out, has been a solid year for us, but maybe not as strong as what we had liked. But clearly, we had a few headwinds in the infrastructure market, and as you pointed out in a rather large customer. So moving off of that, we are very confident in the IDP business growing significantly faster than its underlying markets. James and his team have done a great job of realigning their product portfolio to drive above industry growth there. So I think you're going to see a very nice rebound in growth, beginning actually in the beginning of our fiscal 2017.","As you commented on the \u2013 in the Eric's business, in the mobile phone business, clearly we've got a cautious view in the next couple of quarters as we look out in our guidance that we gave for this quarter along with the beginning of the next fiscal year. With that said, depending on the timing of new program ramps and our confidence in the wins that we already have at our largest three customers, I do believe the second half of FY 2017 will be very strong and should be above the industry growth rates.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I see. And maybe, Bob, as a follow-up to that, when you use the word cautious or conservative around demand, is it that your customers are building fewer units than you thought before? Is it comment on your content at those customers? Is it a market share? What is giving you that caution?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. Let me start with \u2013 absolutely customers are building less phones than what we expected just a month ago even. So some of that is demand. I think what's also important to know is we didn't lose any sockets over the last four months that changed our outlook for the December quarter over the March quarter. So it's more volume. And I think we're also being careful in the timing of new marquee phones that are ramping. This quarter, when you gained significant share depending on the timing of those ramps, can influence our outlook as well. So when I say cautious, I'm thinking about that as well.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Just lastly as a clarification, for Steve, in terms of OpEx trajectory, I think Steve you mentioned cost synergies, but when I look at your OpEx guidance in the mid-$150 million, that's sort of flat versus last March, unless my math is wrong here. So where should we see the evidence of cost synergies? Where can we see that in your reported numbers? Thank you.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So if you look at the last four quarters, revenue's growing about 12%, OpEx has been basically flat. And so there really have been two uses for the OpEx synergies. First is, we have grown revenue and kept OpEx totally flat and so that's an accomplishment. The second key thing is we've reinvested in R&D. So if you look line-by-line in OpEx, you'll see SG&A is down significantly, R&D is up, roughly to a push, right, in terms of total dollars, but a much more productive avenue of spending. Apologies to my friends in the SG&A world, but we prefer to spend money in research and product development, and synergy achievement has allowed us to do that and that's going to translate into a faster growth rate in the future.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thank you.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Great question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Cody Acree with Drexel.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my questions and Steve congratulations on your retirement plans. Maybe just back to the guidance, and as you look at what has changed over the last few weeks, is it more around your largest customer? Or have you seen any material month-to-month, week-to-week linearity changes in orders, maybe on a geographic or on a OEM basis?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'd say, Cody, again, customer demands are always changing that we see. As far as units being produced, I think \u2013 again, I think we're taking a cautious view. I think we've learned a few lessons from December, and I'd rather not get into calling out any specific customers at this time. And I'd also couple with that my comments about the demand that we're seeing on our new marquee phone ramps, and being cautious on that outlook as well.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I guess, Bob...","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","The caution is in mobile, not in IDP, just to be clear.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Correct. Yeah.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I guess, is it more a matter of caution and conservatism? Or is it based on maybe what you're hearing from some of your peers? Or have you seen some tangible change in order rates in the last few weeks?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say nothing has really changed. The industry always goes up and down as you well know, Cody. So I don't know what you're driving at. We guided to $600 million, we feel very good about what we've just said, and we'll update you at the end of the quarter.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I think I understand the dynamics of the top two OEMs pretty clearly, but looking at the Chinese OEMs, can you talk a little bit about the size of that business in the December quarter? How that trended in that quarter, and your expectation forward in the March quarter? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, do you want to take that?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. Sure.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm assuming that was mobile related, Mike?","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Yeah.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. So in general of course we're very excited about the year we're looking forward to in China, really beginning to catch up on our share, our attach (23:14) there. We're ramping into production this quarter our third generation solution, RF Flex solution for that market, it's CA capable, and sort of aligned with what Bob was saying, a lot of those phones are ramping after the Lunar New Year, kind of second half of the March quarter. So that's when \u2013 we've got to see the exact rate and pace of that, but there's no question that the train is coming and our share is going to be increasing there throughout the year.","We're also expecting a pretty good year in China generally. We see the subsidies being increased from the carriers, and also the requirements for received CA coming in throughout the year, which is going to drive a lot of unique solutions that I think we're very well positioned to provide.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","James, do you want to add any color from your perspective on China?","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","Yeah. Mike, this is James Klein. We are seeing some rebound in the infrastructure market in China. I think overall we're up about 18% quarter-over-quarter in that part of the market. And I know we've talked about that for the last three or four quarters. And we're also seeing positive book-to-bill, and this is the first time we've seen a positive book-to-bill in that part of the market as well. So it looks like there's some recovery in the infrastructure side beginning to happen.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Great. And then turning to Steve, on gross margins, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for gross margins? What's driving the improvement in the March quarter and going forward? Is it utilization in March, or mix, and how should we be thinking about modeling margins on a contribution basis going forward?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","I think margins have been roughly around 50%. Your mileage varies every quarter for 101 different reasons of mix and whatever goes on in the quarter. In the quarter we just completed, we had a couple of yield issues. And also December tends to be a higher quarter for excess and obsolete, as our customers in mobile separate the winners from the losers, and sometimes we've got to write off a little inventory from the losers.","And so, that I think was a one-off kind of a 200 basis point hit to margins in the December quarter. And so it's really coming back to where we're running naturally, is around 50%. As you know our long-term goal is to move margins up to 55% and we are hard at work at both developing and implementing parts of our manufacturing cost reduction road map, including some significant changes in filter wafer sizes and significant activities there. And finally, our completion of our synergies, moving the former TriQuint mobile portfolio, assembly and test activity into China. So I think there's some good stuff on the longer-term horizon. Next quarter, I think we kind of come back to our current run rate which is right around 50%.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey guys. I wanted a little bit of clarification. I think you guys touched upon this earlier, marquee handsets, you see strong demand in the second half, Bob. I was curious if these designs have been won and also what kind of visibility do you have for that September, December quarter ramp?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks Harsh. As I said in my opening comments, plus we put in our press release, we feel very good about the design wins that we have in our top three customers, marquee phones that are launching this year. Some of those phones begin ramping later in this quarter and we'll see some others as you typically see launches throughout the year, and clearly they are in the second half. So I feel we have very good visibility into that.","Again, I think timing of any marquee phone can vary, and when phones ramp at the end of the quarters, they can influence which quarter they fall in. Depending on also which subcons you're shipping into. But Harsh, we feel very good about the wins, and feel very good about the second half of fiscal 2017 for our mobile products.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. And then as a follow-up, maybe going to Steve, Steve you did a $250 million buyback. Was that basically on plan with what you were thinking going into the quarter, or did you get more aggressive because of where you saw the stock at? And, also, the $750 million that you were talking about, that you have left, Steve, is there a time fuse on it? Does it have to be done in a certain way? Would you just take us over those criterias?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","I'd be delighted to. Well, I'd say that, second quarter pretty much worked out as planned and we do have some interest in sub-dollar costing concepts, but we're also opportunistic. So December was as planned. The formal buyback program has nine more months left to go. Now you and I both know that's the stroke of a pen with the Board of Directors but that's the current plan of record. And I do believe that at the current price when you look at the history consensus and the cost of our stock I think it's an attractive opportunity.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have one short one and then a follow up. The first one is regarding some of the design wins that you've talked about at your three \u2013 the three largest mobile customers. Can you maybe provide some granularity as to where you've gained the content and by how much?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll tell you what Toshi, I appreciate your question. We'll do our best without giving away too much competitive advantage, and I'll let Eric get little more specific but it's broad-based, and it's across multiple products that we offer to the market. So don't think of it as just power amplifiers or just switches or just tuners or just Diversity Receive Modules, et cetera. But it's pretty diverse. But I don't know Eric, if we can comment.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Good. Yeah, that's really the key point. There are certainly some, particular slots that are very high dollar value, but it's the real strength I think in the design wins and this goes across all three of the customers. The things we're looking to ramp this year is just the diversity of the applications that we're providing. As you know with our technologies we have in-house, we have access to virtually the entire RF Front End, and so we're able to architect complete solutions and more and more as we go throughout this year you're going to see more adoption of more like a complete solution from Qorvo.","So it includes, as Bob said, not just the kind of traditional power amplifier and switch, and even filter markets, but antenna tuning is definitely continuing to increase and going down into the mid-tier now, so there's a lot of opportunity there. And we mentioned ET power management as well. We're starting to see ET kick back in and move into other parts of the portfolio and other base band suppliers. So you add all this together with the diversity modules and the RF Fusion modules and Flex and so forth, we just have a broad portfolio. And we're winning in each of those areas.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Okay, great. Thank you. And my follow up is regarding the Qualcomm-TDK joint venture, how do you view that joint venture from a competitive standpoint? I'm guessing the impact in the short-term is minimal if anything. But I was curious more how you viewed the landscape on a longer-term basis? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Thanks Toshi. I think on the long-term we would also echo your comments. And, in fact, it opens up opportunities for us. If you look at our \u2013 Qorvo along with our competitors, there's a couple of interesting things that we all perform across multiple baseband manufacturers and work with them. And on TDK, as you well know, has been working with several of those manufacturers as well and, quite honestly, it's hard for us to think that a MediaTek or, pick whoever else you want, is going to be able to share with them their front-end designs and their architectures when they know everything that they tell them is going to basically be given the Qualcomm and their RF360 front-end. So we actually look at this and go this is probably going to open up some opportunities for us.","We've made our investments in our filters, clearly us and our two largest competitors buy from TDK and, quite honestly, we're just going to insource more of our own filters. We're bringing up 6-inch. So we think it's going to help our P&L as well. It's going to accelerate the movements that we're making there. But net-net, at a high level, nothing's really changed. That's been their partner since day one. They build their modules, build the \u2013 use filters, et cetera. So if anything, we're looking at it and going wow, this could open up some other doors for us.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks. Eric, yeah, you just said there were more adoption of complete solutions. What does that mean? Does that mean more individual components at your largest customers? Or are the second and third tier OEMs moving more to integrated parts like pads or flex or fusion away from the streets?","And then James, you were seeing rebound in infrastructure. Is that predominantly in China? Or is it more widespread than that, and is it exclusively 4G? Or are you seeing a wider rebound?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, go ahead first.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Sure. Yes, so what I was referring to Ed is, literally a transition where we're working with our largest customers, as well as some of the chipset providers as well to propose literally complete solutions. So we have Qorvo part numbers that span the entire RF Front End and it's a question just rate and pay to how soon we're able to bring each of the pieces in, and get them to fit with the exact configurations that each individual customer is looking forward essentially. But going from a mode where someone else's architecting the front-end and giving us specs, and we're responding to those, maybe influencing them to where from the very beginning they say okay, architect the full front-end for us that does X, Y, and Z.","Okay. And base station recovery, I would say it's broad-based across the OEMs, some are little more than others. It's sometimes difficult for us to know exactly where our components go in to what market. But as we look at what our customers are saying, it would appear that that recovery is based somewhat in China. And then I didn't hear the second part of your question?","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Is it mostly 4G base stations?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah, mostly 4G base stations. One other thing I would say though is we are seeing a significant amount of interest in LTE-A and LTE Pro. We're seeing our multi-MIMO or massive-MIMO system starting to get demonstrations happening. So there's a lot of other things that also show that that market in general is starting to gather some strength, and a little bit in small cell as well.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Great. And then, Eric, follow-up to you if I could. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that Envelope Tracking looks like it might be ramping. Can you remind us, was that material? Has ET been material through revenue line last year or so? And then it sounds like you're ramping in more than one major OEM, or these big, flagship product launches or I'm trying to get a scale of what this is, and I know you don't like to talk ASPs, but just give us an idea of what the revenue opportunity in a TAM kind of sense would be for Envelope Tracking? And then a follow-up on tuning if I could?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. So as you know, we had ramped ET pretty successfully into one of the leading OEMs a couple of years ago now. I don't remember the exact timing, but for the past several quarters those phones had ramped down and it's not been meaningful at all. So now it's being re-invigorated. We've got a new version coming out and we're ramping with one of our leading customers currently as we speak with that technology and it will be proliferating throughout their portfolio and potentially moving to other OEMs throughout the year.","Operator","At this time, we'll move along to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but just in some of the, maybe shortfall, on the March quarter versus maybe what you're thinking a month ago, are you suggesting that it's the timing of the ramp here is just pushed out a little bit. So at the end of the day you just get it, it's just in a different quarter? Am I understanding that right or am I reading too much into it?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take a shot at that, Steve. At a higher level, I would say it's the demand from customers first, and then the timing of the new product ramps. So I would weigh it a little bit differently maybe than the way you commented there.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just in terms of IDP, in terms of new products, particularly around gallium nitride, can you talk a little bit about how you see the power amplifier market developing there? How much you think you'll play in that, and gain versus LDMOS replacement timing?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me talk broadly about the power amp market for GaN. First of all, the fastest part of that market growth is really in the defense side, and there were obviously actively participating number one in the market, tremendous amount of products getting released. Really to cover a broad spectrum of low frequency high power all the way up into products that are covering K-band. So, great coverage for us in the defense side, great growth for us in the defense side and very broad based.","In the base station, if you look at what's some of the forecasts around the industry, it's projected that GaN will overtake LDMOS as far as total size, somewhere in the next, maybe, three years or four years. So substantial growth in GaN, LDMOS will continue to decline. And that's driven by the trends that we've been talking about for the last several quarters, a continuing increase in bandwidth, the move to massive MIMO, all of those sort of things are going to drive GaN more and more into this marketplace.","And as far as our positioning, we've got products out there released across multiple different bands and we're engaged with the majority of the top OEMs in the space.","Operator","At this time we'll move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the December miss. Your largest customer wasn't down that much sequentially, I was wondering how much of the Android world contributed to that $100 million miss in December.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Blayne, as far as expectations when we provided guidance to where we ended up, let's call it the non-Android part of the world.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the gross margin and then the related inventories, you talked about writing off some and then inventory still moved up. So just Steve, if you could talk about where you would like to get inventories to and if you could just quantify how much you did write-off in the quarter.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The reason inventory didn't perform very well is we had a last minute reduction in the demand for our product. So we built the product and then we weren't able to ship it at the end of the quarter. So that's why our turns were up at 3.3, which is not anywhere near our expectations. We think turns ought to be north of 4. For sure, we think we can achieve that, but I would say the December quarter is somewhat of an anomaly due to the rather abrupt reduction in demand from a particular large customer.","And in terms of the write-off, it was about $4 million. Rather bigger than typical, but not a huge amount. The 200 basis point miss in margins had a greater impact from yield than write-off of excess and obsolete, but it was a factor.","Operator","Next question will be from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Appreciate it. Just two if I could. Could you talk a little bit on the mobile business? You covered China pretty well. How do you think things are going in the non-China emerging markets for your customers? And then back to the cost synergies, it sounds like a little ahead for the first year. Just curious, to get to that $150 million through the end of this fiscal year, what does the linearity look like for that? Would that be more back-end loaded, or do you think we could see some of that coming in the earlier part of next fiscal year? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. This is Eric. So if I understood your question, it was about the non-China emerging markets, and that is an interesting question. I think that's something that's going to percolate throughout the year. We think roughly 50 million units of 4G smartphones could be consumed in that kind of emerging market outside of China. The majority of those will be provided by our current customers, of course, in a lot of the China brands. And one of the things that's interesting as China is moving towards five-mode or full-mode handsets, those customers are getting better and better at including really complex RF in there.","And so when we look to these new emerging markets, instead of taking a traditional approach or doing kind of a real stripped down, low-cost phone, they're generally starting with their full-mode phones and adding the bands for those regions to them. And that's one of the things that's driving the antenna tuner demand we've talked about in China. Between that and the fact that they're also adopting very high quality global look and feel, if you will, handsets that have metal cases, for example, all the same things that drove antenna tuning into the highest tier, really that's where our China-based customers are taking their products for all of these 4G markets.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","And with respect to the timing of the remaining synergies, largely in the second half of the calendar year. While we talk about moving ex-TriQuint mobile parts, what it really amounts to is beginning new mobile parts in the factory that they're going to be tested and assembled in. And so it's the significant new product launches that happen in the fall that drive our ability to achieve those synergies.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Moving forward we'll hear from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks. Congrats on the earnings preservation despite the variable revenues. First question is on half year split. So calendar 2015 first half and second half split is actually about 50\/50 in terms of revenues. Steve, in the past, you've made good calls in terms of splits. Just wondering if you have thoughts on this calendar year?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","I'm going to stay away from that this time. The merger of RFMD and TriQuint, the numbers are a little different. And then there's so much impact in terms of how successful certain large customers are with their launches that I'm not confident enough to give you a fearless forecast.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Is it between 45\/55 and 50\/50 then, or \u2013 that's been the range historically. I have to try.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate the effort.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Well, I get a follow-up then. So...","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. For sure.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","For James, IDT, base stations up 18%, that's a good chunk of that segment. So what actually declined a bit in the quarter and is that decline transient, James? Thanks.","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","We saw a little bit of a slowdown in our transport business and that was probably one of the biggest offsets. Some of that was associated with the normal decrease in our pricing as we go through volume cuts. Some of that, we think was a little bit of inventory correction in that part of the business. But I would say that was the most significant offset. And to tell you the truth, we had in that part of the transport business, we had a really strong first half in our cable part of the business and it's returned to sort of what I would call normal level through the back half. So it's between those two things that was predominate shift.","Operator","At this time we'll take a question from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Steve, a question on CapEx. It came down a bit in the quarter. I'm just wondering how we should think about the CapEx for the next few quarters? And also, if the Qualcomm-TDK JV, wondering if that will have any impact on your CapEx?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So I'll answer the second question first. The answer is no. With regards to the first, you know I think that $60 million a quarter is a pretty fair run rate. It might be $70 million a quarter, but it's somewhere in that ZIP code and the majority of that will be for filter capacity expansion; some of the wafer size increases where we're moving SAW and TC-SAW from four inch wafers to six-inch; BAW from six-inch wafers to eight-inch and expanding our SAW footprint into the factory here in North Carolina.","Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Got it. And then maybe for Bob. Bob you mentioned that you were prototyping hexaplexers. Just curious as to when you'd think you'll be shipping them for production. And also a follow-up to that, as you go from discrete filters to quad and hex, what happens to your ASP? The question is, I mean, as you go from four discretes to quad, does it just quadruple or do you see additional increase in your ASP? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead Eric.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","All right. So I'll answer the second question first. There's definitely a premium in the integration. A quadplexer is far more than just four filters put together. The circuit design, the ability to actually assemble them and maintain performance and so forth is critical. So there is a definite premium over just adding the number of filters together.","And regarding the hexaplexer, that's really going to be determined by the need for 3CA and higher modes in the phones and to the customers we ship. We think we'll have readiness, second half of this year with the hexaplexers and so we could see production as early as this fall or definitely in calendar 2017.","Operator","And now we will move to Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just looking at \u2013 you mentioned on the mobile side, there is a slight step down in demand. Just wondering was it \u2013 has it been slowing down all the last month or was it a step down? And also when you look at the March quarter, is your implied OpEx actually going up, sequentially?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, you take the OpEx. But as far as customer demand goes, as Steve even commented about our inventory just a little bit ago, it came at the end of the quarter and kind of continued for a while. We believe we've seen the bottom. We're taking a cautious view on this quarter and as we look out into June and again, I think the big story here is our IDP business is returning to growth year-over-year. And from the perspective of the mobile business, we've locked down the design wins that we need to drive a strong second half in FY 2017.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. For OpEx, I think we're going to end up in the high $140 millions, maybe $150 million in the March quarter and then we'll go through our planning process of looking at subsequent year. We'll clearly grow our OpEx well below the rate of revenue growth, but we'll talk more about that next time we have a call and we'll have completed our annual planning process.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And then when you look at your six-inch mix, as you ramp that where do you see that exiting 2016 on the SAW side? And if you can give us some color on how the eight-inch ramp looks on BAW, let's say exiting calendar 2016? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As far the conversion for four-inch to six-inch, again, we disqualified the process. So we're getting those designed in and it depends on \u2013 sorry, the timing of new program ramps and things like that. But it will not be the majority at the end of 2016 as far as temp comp SAW six-inch goes in Florida, and then we're bringing up the six-inch in Greensboro that will be in production this year.","As far as eight-inch goes, as I said in my opening comments, for BAW filters, we will be converting this year over to eight-inch and beginning the ramps in 2017.","Operator","At this time we'll hear from Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks. To caution on your flagship phone shipping later this quarter, is that timing of a launch of all the models or are you more exposed to specific SKUs with a lot of content gain, so you don't know when those are shipping.","And then Bob you just said that BAW would ramp on eight-inch in 2017, so essentially you'll be on six-inch in BAW for production in 2016. Is that \u2013 how should we you take that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct, Ed. On the BAW filters, we're on six-inch, we're bringing up the eight-inch line and now. We're qualified \u2013 get qualified with the customers and ramp in 2017, that's correct. And as far as the flagship phones, Eric anything?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. And it's not related to any specific SKUs, any geographical SKUs, Ed.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Okay. So it's just global. And then Steve, you mentioned (48:36)","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","...share gains coming on a new platform and the timing of that is already naturally back-end loaded in the quarter, then you have to be a little conservative about exactly how that ramp is going to go.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Yeah. And I know you you've added a few flagships to the phone (48:50), that's why I was trying to get to sort of the whole, whole ramp that maybe fall other side of the quarter. And Steve, you had mentioned yield problems, is that gas filters or SOI?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'm not going to go into the details of the specifics, but they were \u2013 once in a while, you hit those. They were both confined to the quarter and have been resolved.","Operator","And at this time, we'll take a question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey guys. Thanks for allowing me ask a follow-up here. Real quickly, Steve you mentioned $15 million of OpEx \u2013 I'm sorry, interest expense guide. How do we think about that on a full year number? Do we just roll that or is there something built in into that number?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","No that's a good go-forward number. That's a very reasonable number.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","So for each quarter, $15 million?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","And yeah, that's a very fair number and that's why we wanted to make sure we guided it. I want to note that we only had half of a quarter's worth in December. So that's the jump, sequentially.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. And then the second question was regards to the \u2013 previously, in a couple of quarters, you had margins as high as 51%. Now that IDP is starting to come back for you, how do you feel about, with all these cost cuts, I mean these in-sourcing actions that you've got going on, and maybe this IDP piece coming back strongly, how do you feel about the margin profile as you go out?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer","Long-term, we have a goal to get to 55%. I think it's a goal founded on some significant cost reduction opportunities. And you're right, with IDP coming back, that's accretive to our overall margins and it'll be very helpful. For the quarter coming up, I think we'll be at 50% and there's lots of small puts and takes, but I think that's where the company is operating at roughly over the last four quarters or so. But again, I see a good opportunity for the company to get to 55% and growth in IDP is surely going to help.","Operator","And that does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","We'd like to thank everyone for joining us this evening. We are looking forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and at Mobile World Congress in a few weeks in Barcelona. Thanks again for your time, and good night.","Operator","Once again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation."],"18389":["Qorvo, Inc.

Q3 2020 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks very much, John. Hello everybody and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today\u2019s release and on today\u2019s call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses, or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today, available on our website at qorvo.com, under Investors.","Sitting with me today are; Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; James Klein, President of Qorvo\u2019s Infrastructure and Defense Products Group; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo\u2019s Mobile Products Group; as well as other members of Qorvo\u2019s management team.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug and welcome everyone. Qorvo delivered record EPS in the December quarter driven by strength in our end-markets of 5G, Wi-Fi and Defense. I am especially pleased with how our team is engaging with customers to enable breakthrough products and contribute to multiyear technology upgrade cycles. ","In Mobile Products, the acceleration of 5G is driving demand for Qorvo\u2019s high-performance and highly integrated solutions. Carriers are bringing advanced 5G services across new frequency spectrum and that\u2019s driving greater complexity, enhanced designs as board space remains constrained. Qorvo is solving that complexity by integrating the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio of technologies and advancing the state-of-the-art and functional integration. ","Looking at December, we enjoyed significant design win traction for our BAW-based multiplexers across a range of band combinations including our hexaplexers and our recently launched micro BAW-based quadplexer. These are multiplexers enable advanced carrier aggregation and they are critical to next-generation higher data rate applications. ","We also secured multiple design wins to supply low, mid-high and ultra-high band solutions for next-generation 5G smartphones. These are highly integrated and high performance 4G 5G solutions enabling customers to reduce product footprint, enhance system performance and deliver products to the market even faster. ","Design wins for our ultra high band FEM were broad based across customers and made with multiple 5G cellular chipsets. Qorvo\u2019s solutions deliver highly differentiated performance at higher frequencies as we expand our content in the next wave of 5G smartphones. ","Consistent with what we said last quarter, we continue to expect approximately 300 million 5G handsets in calendar year 2020 adding approximately $2 billion to the mobile RF PAM. ","Turning to IDP, our GaN customer engagements broadened during the December quarter as we ramp GaN high-power amplifiers and small signal components at a third major OEM in support of 5G massive MIMO deployments. ","To support China Mobile\u2019s deployment of 5G small cell, we ramped our newest BAW filters at a top-tier infrastructure OEM. We also introduced breakthrough GaAs FEMs addressing the more demanding requirements of second-generation 5G millimeter wave base stations. ","In our Connectivity business, we enjoyed a rebound in demand driven by Wi-Fi 6 and supported by recently released GaAs and BAW processors. Customer demand for our newest Wi-Fi 6 FEMs was broad based and support CPE, retail and mobile applications. ","For the Connected Home, we began sampling the industry\u2019s first radio solution combining Zigbee, Thread and Bluetooth Low Energy SoC with a Wi-Fi 6 FEM to enable next-generation distributed Wi-Fi networks. ","For the connected car, we introduced a complex \u2013 excuse me, we introduced a complete V2X front-end solution, featuring our recently released 5.9 gigahertz Wi-Fi coexistence BAW filters, which are quickly gaining traction among automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. ","Finally, we continue to expand our customer base in the programmable power management end-market, shipping power management ICs into datacenter solid state drives for two of the top three storage providers. ","After the quarter closed, we signed definitive agreements to acquire Decawave, a pioneer in ultra-wideband solutions for mobile, automotive and IoT applications; and Custom MMIC, a leading supplier of high-performance GaAs and GaN MMICs for defense and aerospace applications. ","Adding Decawave establishes our position in the emerging market for ultra-accurate, ultra-secure short range location solutions. Custom MMICs expands our portfolio of high-performance GaAs and GaN solutions for the defense and aerospace industries. ","Looking forward, we see both IDP and Mobile Products growing year-over-year in the March quarter on the strength of our broad technology portfolio and strong underlying trends in our end-markets. ","And with that, I will hand the call over to Mark. ","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the third quarter was $869 million, $19 million above the midpoint of our guidance and driven by stronger than expected mobile demand.","Mobile revenue of $662 million exceeded our expectations on Asia-based customer demand including 5G solutions. IDP revenue improved sequentially to $207 million on strong Defense volumes and remained down year-over-year due to export restrictions on infrastructure products. ","We expect IDP revenue to increase again sequentially and return to year-over-year growth in the March quarter on sustained strength in defense, the ramp of Wi-Fi 6, and broader 5G infrastructure customer demand. ","Non-GAAP gross margin in the December quarter was 49.3% with better than expected manufacturing costs and favorable mix effects. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $176 million, which were at the low-end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income in the December quarter was $221 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.86, $0.19 over the midpoint of our guidance.","Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $301 million and CapEx was $41 million, which yielded free cash flow of $260 million. Our free cash flow through the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was over $600 million, exceeding any prior full fiscal year. ","We repurchased a $125 million of stock in the quarter and completed an opportunistic $200 million add-on to our 2029 unsecured notes issued earlier in the quarter. During the December quarter, we completed the purchase of the remaining equity in Cavendish Kinetics, an RF MEMS company, further strengthening our technology portfolio for switches, tuners, and other products.","As Bob mentioned, following the quarter end, we signed definitive agreements to acquire two companies that we have been evaluating for extended periods. With both companies, there is excellent strategic alignment and cultural fit. ","Decawave, a pioneer and leading supplier of ultra-wideband solutions adds to Qorvo\u2019s RF technology leadership and opens up access to a large new and rapidly growing wireless market. Custom MMIC, a leader in high-performance GaAs and GaN MMICs solutions for defense and aerospace markets is a bolt-on to IDP\u2019s core business. ","The combined purchase value of these two acquisitions is approximately $500 million, which will be funded from existing cash on hand. Our guidance assumes both transactions close in February and the financial impact slightly diluted to earnings in the near-term is reflected in our March guidance.","Turning to our March quarter outlook, we expect revenue between $800 million and $840 million or $820 million at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55 at the midpoint of our guidance.","Our revenue outlook for the March quarter reflects continued robust mobile 5G demand and a return to year-over-year growth for IDP. For Mobile, we expect March quarter sales to decrease sequentially but with less than normal seasonality. ","For IDP, we project March quarter sales to increase on sustained strength in defense, the ramp of Wi-Fi 6 ramp and broader 5G infrastructure customer demand. While Qorvo's current near-term outlook is strong and channels are healthy, trade and other factors including potential demand and supply chain effects related to the coronavirus concerns contributed to challenges and uncertainty forecast in the outlook.","On gross margin, our March quarter guide of approximately 48.5%, is down sequentially consistent with comments I made during our last earnings call. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the March quarter to approximately $185 million on higher personnel cost including payroll effects and incremental cost associated with acquired businesses. ","Net interest expense will increase with our notes add on a lower cash balance following acquisitions. We expect our March non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 7.5%. On capital expenditures, we project less than a $190 million this fiscal year and remain highly disciplined on adding capacity. Our free cash flow forecast for the year is now over $700 million. ","As the December quarter results and our March outlook show, Qorvo is helping customers grow in 5G, Wi-Fi, Defense and other markets by solving their challenges with best-in-class technology, award-winning quality, and supply dependability. ","With that I'll turn the call back over to John for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company.","Karl Ackerman ","Thank you, gentlemen. I have two questions if I may. First question is on margins. So, I get the seasonal softness in the March quarter. But as you finalize the consolidation of SAW Fab in Greensboro \u2013 to Greensboro, your 5G ultra-high-band PAD FEM content likely proliferates across the top 6. Mobile OEMs later on this year and IDP returns to growth in the back half, why can\u2019t operating margins approach 30% by the end of this year?","Mark Murphy","Yes, Karl two \u2013 this is Mark, two effects on operating margins in the March quarter. One is \u2013 and I\u2019ll start with OpEx, as I mentioned, OpEx is going to increase sequentially due to a number of factors, payroll effects and the incremental cost associated with the acquisitions. ","Moving up to gross margin, consistent with what I said last quarter, we will see a sequential decline in gross margin, which is typical around seasonal product mix effects. So, yes, this is very much in line with what I said last quarter, about a 100 basis point or so decrease sequentially. ","Karl Ackerman ","Got it. Thank you. And for my follow-up, regarding your March outlook, it seems your base assumptions call for a slightly less seasonal decline in that \u2013 I guess, a seasonal decline in your largest customer, but a sizable uptick at China handset providers and maybe some stability at your Korean customer, given all design wins you alluded to last quarter and of course earlier today in your prepared comments. ","First, am I thinking about at that the right way? Second, how should we think about the revenue opportunity from China handsets? I think, for the overall industry, would you endorse content from mainstream handsets advancing from $1 to $2 to like 6 bucks? Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Karl, I\u2019ll take the beginning of that from a perspective of just looking at a year-over-year, both businesses are returning to growth year-over-year, that\u2019s great to see. In our IDP business, sequentially it\u2019s growing very nicely. So that\u2019s also offsetting some of the seasonality. It\u2019s typically flat to up slightly. So that\u2019s doing well. ","And in our Mobile business, very pleased with how much we are offsetting year-over-year the decline that we\u2019ve seen at Huawei and it\u2019s broad based. So we are seeing strength across the customer base. But I\u2019ll let Eric add a little more color to the specifics of the customer base that you ask about. ","Eric Creviston","Sure. Yes, as you referenced the 5G rollout in China, it\u2019s very much on track and content gains there associated with more bands and wider bands and multiple carrier operation and so forth is leading to an expansion of dollar content, as well as units a bit higher than we had originally planned. In terms of dollar content opportunity that you referenced, it\u2019s not at all unusual means, 5G handsets. ","You see total dollar content in the $10 to $12 range and they tend to buy as much as that as possible from one supplier. So, we have many handsets in China, we have $8 to $10 worth of order content. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. ","Toshiya Hari ","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. My first one was IDP. You guys talked about Wi-Fi 6 and GaNs and defense contributing to growth in the March quarter. Can you kind of help us quantify sort of the magnitude of all three on a relative basis? And if you can speak to sustainability beyond the March quarter for those three buckets, that would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up.","James Klein","Yes, this is James. Now the year-over-year growth will be relatively small, but considering we lost one of our top customers just a few quarters ago, I am really pleased with the efforts in the team to return back to growth. So quickly, I think it does demonstrate the underlying strengths of the products that we have in the markets that we serve. ","Defense, low-power wireless and power management will all have double-digit year-over-year growth quarters in March. Wi-Fi, as we talked about with the ramp of Wi-Fi 6 is returning and it will have a high single-digit type growth rate and then other markets that we serve I think will be a mix of up and downs. ","Still it\u2019s at the phase of deployments in base station, we are starting ramps and starting to recover, but with loss of Huawei, we are obviously still significantly off of our all-time highs in base stations. ","Toshiya Hari ","Got it. And then, my second one is for Mark. In terms of free cash flow, it looks like for the full year, you are thinking free cash flow margins of 22-ish percent based on your Q4 revenue guide and your full year free cash flow commentary, which I think is the highest free cash flow margin since the merger. I guess, importantly, going forward, do you feel like there is more upside from there? ","Or is this as good as it gets? And to the extent, you do think there is more upside? What are some of the levers that you can pull to improve margins? And then sort of related to that, as you continue to build cash, how are you thinking about cash usage between organic investments, M&A and shareholder return? Thank you. ","Mark Murphy","There is a lot in that question, Toshiya. I\u2019ll work through it. So, yes, we are really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on free cash and it\u2019s been an absolute focus for the company. We\u2019ve gone from $224 million free cash flow in the year, up to we are now forecasting over $700 million in just a \u2013 in a number of years here. ","And, we reached close to 30% basically \u2013 right, almost on top of 30% in the quarter on free cash flow margins and I think that\u2019s an objective we set some time ago for the full year. So, we are not going to \u2013 as you say, we are going to be closer to 22%, but we continue to see the ability to expand free cash flow margins. ","And it\u2019s \u2013 nothing has really changed. I\u2019ve gone through this in previous calls. We are pursuing a model in investing in a way to achieve stronger and more sustainable free cash flow generation over time and that comes from investing in the right technologies of which you see some of that in the acquisitions we announced today. It\u2019s selecting the right products and having a rigorous portfolio management process which we have executed on. ","It\u2019s driving productivity in operations and sourcing and I can\u2019t say enough about the job the ops team is doing in meeting customer quality expectations and on-time delivery and doing it efficiently. And then the ops alignment with the business is as good as it's ever been in the company. So, seeing great things there. And then, finally, we are just focused on reducing capital intensity. ","And all those factors have helped with margin expansion. On gross margin, specifically, there is room to run we believe. We are still not at the utilization levels that we had hoped this year. The infrastructure market softness has impacted us in a couple areas in the network, particularly, Texas GaAs, GaN in Oregon. ","We, in the fourth quarter or in the December quarter, we had period cost in Florida. As I think Karl mentioned, those do drop off in March. But we still have some period cost associated with farmers branch and some small period costs elsewhere. And then, over time, we expect IDP to improve as a percent of the overall mix. ","And I\u2019ve talked about portfolio management and operations productivity and so forth. So, I believe in the ability of our business to grow the top-line. We have a number of levers to expand margins. We are focused on spending capital only when we need to and then, driving free cash flow growth which allows us to make prudent investments either for accretion or technologies. ","And finally, you asked about capital allocation. Basically, in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve generated $754 million of free cash flow. We\u2019ve repurchased $689 million of shares. So, over 90% returned to shareholders. And then over this time, we\u2019ve also completed the purchase of two companies over $500 million. That\u2019s not including the two we announced today. ","So, we will continue to again, drive free cash flow growth and then, look for investments that makes sense for Qorvo. We\u2019ve set technology investments for both Mobile and IDP and then bolt-ons for IDP is typically how we look at things. And then what - depending on our leverage and other factors, we will return cash to shareholders. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. ","Harsh Kumar ","Yes, hey guys. Congratulations. Fantastic execution and congratulations on that cash flow number. I know you guys have been focused on that. I want to put you on a spot here, Bob. You had a pretty strong Mobile, March guide and you are also \u2013 you are basically saying pretty good strength in 5G, pretty good design win traction. ","I take that to be that this strength in March, the better than seasonal strength in March is not going to come at the expense of the rest of the year. Historically, June, September, December have all been much better quarters. Could you just maybe, to the best that you can, I know it\u2019s a tough one, but best you can provide us some color. ","Mark Murphy","Yes, maybe, Harsh, this is Mark, maybe I\u2019ll step in and we are going to provide more information on FY 2021 at the next earnings call. As it relates to June, we are not going to provide detailed guidance in that quarter either. But I think maybe this is a time to talk about rest of the June quarter. Now, we feel good about the March quarter. ","This coronavirus concerns and first our thought was those affected in the region, but we\u2019ve been revisiting our outlook based on those concerns. We are comfortable with our forecast and feel that we\u2019ve adjusted for what we perceive now as some risk. But we\u2019ve been keeping a close eye in that situation including extensive checks on the supply chain. ","To-date, we\u2019ve seen no material impact to our supply chain or what demand signals. However, the situation is evolving. So, we have reflected some added risk as I mentioned to our March guide including, as you\u2019ll notice a wider range of outcomes. ","So, to your question, likewise we are thinking about potential effects into the June quarter and even though our channels are lean, we are concerned about how this plays out, because we just don\u2019t know. As it stands now, we would estimate the June quarter to be between $750 million to $800 million of revenue. But again, it\u2019s early. ","There is a lot of uncertainty around that. We will provide a more detailed update at a later date and a fiscal year 2021 view on our next earnings call. ","Harsh Kumar ","That\u2019s fair. I appreciate the color that you gave. As a follow-up, the strength in China that you guys are seeing, maybe one for Bob or Eric, what kind of customers is that coming from? Is that coming from the Tier twos? Or is that also, to some extent, coming from Huawei at this point? ","Bob Bruggeworth","Right, yes, it\u2019s primarily throughout Asia, so Korea and China, as well. And we are relatively high in 5G handsets or still entering the channel for now. We are beginning to also see our large customers in China. ","So Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi for example bringing 5G further down into the portfolio with some of the handsets that will be launching in the March quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson ","Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question and great job on the results and guide. Maybe first one for Eric. In going back to your Analyst Day from 1.5 years, I guess, maybe closer to two years ago, you talked about some unique advantage of your BAW relative to other filter technologies, net BAW and so forth. ","You've been discussing ultra-high-band wins n79 in particular. And also, recently you're talking about traction with your new micro BAW. I guess, can you give us an update how your BAW is helping you win relative to competitors against both in tranche, as well as new entrants for some of these 5G-specific bands? ","And I guess, in terms of our content, you've been talking with us about antennaplexing, and we haven't heard as much about that recently. But, how has that been playing out? And then, I guess how can you meet the demand in that given your portfolio - your BAW portfolio? Thanks.","Bob Bruggeworth","Right. Yes. Thanks Bill. The technology roadmap has continued to progress for us since we formed the company. We\u2019ve really made just a ton of progress in improving the performance of our SMR BAW filters and also our ability to integrate them into modules and also together, to make antennaplexers in a high-level, multiplexers and so forth. ","So, that\u2019s maturing and getting more and more competitive every single month. In addition, of course, at the same time, the market is asking for higher performance, more bands are being added it seems every quarter. ","Wider bandwidth, multi-channel operation and so forth. So, there is plenty of challenges to be met with the filter technology and it\u2019s frankly a pretty target-rich environment right now for these opportunities. ","So, I think it\u2019s fundamental technology combined really with our ability to integrate it with also very, very good power amplifiers for example in the ultra-high-band opportunities. The power amplifier efficiency and power levels are very important to accomplish. And then, of course, our leadership in switching technologies and putting all those into high-level modules together. ","It\u2019s very similar to the fundamental trends we talked about for several quarters now. We are just continuing the march on driving the investments into the core technologies to make it better. ","Bill Peterson ","Okay. Great. And I guess the next question, I guess, both you and James can chime in. On the top of the millimeter waves, obviously, some of your competitors are talking up the millimeter wave opportunities. It appears like you and your closest competitor are really still focused on sub-6. I guess, for the Mobile side, what unique and different solutions could you bring to the market? ","What are the key hurdles to address? What are the key base technologies, power amplifiers, switching filters and so forth? And I guess, James said, what he spoke to it a little bit earlier in the prepared remarks, but how do you see the growth of the millimeter wave and the impact to his business and some of the unique, I guess, things that he can bring to the market as well?","Eric Creviston","Yes. So, thanks. I\u2019ll start. This is Eric and so, the unique strengths that we bring to millimeter wave and in the Mobile side is really leveraging the work that James has done in the infrastructure side and defense applications, developing advanced Gallium Arsenide processes for millimeter wave operations. ","So we have released new commercial versions of those processes and have introduced those to multiple handset manufacturers and platform providers. We are building prototypes to help demonstrate the capability of mobile millimeter wave and showing out what could be done in terms of thermal dissipation and power efficiency and battery life and so forth. ","But, at the end of the day, I think, the big questions is whether the business model is going to close on it, I think there is a lot of challenges in millimeter wave in a mobile application. By definition, you are moving in a mobile application and the path loss is quite high millimeter wave. So, we will see. We are certainly getting us demonstrations out there. ","You are seeing carriers put up a millimeter wave in multiple cities and we are going to be participating in helping to validate the markets. ","James Klein","And Bill, this is James. And as far as infrastructure is involved, I mean, we are certainly engaged very similar to what we showed in our Analyst Day, almost a couple of years ago about how we see more and more of those systems using GaAs-based front-ends getting away from pure silicon solutions, because it\u2019s just a much more efficient implementation. ","But we also are also seeing fixed wireless come on board and the last mile, if you call it, and we\u2019ve released some products this last quarter to start to address those kind of parts of the market. And again, kind of leading the industry inefficiency based on those GaAs processes in particular, some of the smallest gate links that we\u2019ve released in production. So, really, high frequency focus type activities. ","I also want to add to the BAW question, we talked about how BAW is enabling inside Mobile, Eric did, but it\u2019s also been a big benefit for us in the Wi-Fi market. We\u2019ve released iFEMS in the 2.4 gigahertz and we\u2019ve been sampling those at 5 gigahertz as well. ","We are also using our new 5 gigahertz processes to release products in the automotive space and into small cells and base stations. So, we are using our filter technology to really allow us to compete in several different markets and for me particularly, in the higher frequencies. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. ","Seth Gilbert","Hey, this is Seth Gilbert on for Tim. Just, I guess a follow-up to one of the earlier questions. June is usually up something like mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter and September is usually well into the double-digits quarter-over-quarter. So, just curious of this much new higher base for March. Is this sort of right way to think about seasonality is as we look on to June and into September? Thanks. ","Mark Murphy","Yes. Seth, this is Mark. I reluctantly go to June because of the coronavirus concerns and I gave a revenue number there. The only thing I would add just to make sure, folks are appreciative of it. We tend to go down from our March to June at on gross margins. So we would see the revenue guide I gave and then we would see a gross margin in the 47, somewhere between 47 and the high 47s \u2013 low 47 to high 47. ","So, and then we have OpEx increasing. But beyond that, I am not going to talk about September. I am not going to give detail on fiscal 2021. I would just say that we believe we are investing in the right areas and selecting the right products, building the right capabilities to support growth in the market and we expect to grow and then, we are driving for free cash flow generation. And I will provide more in the \u2013 during the next earnings call. ","Seth Gilbert","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. ","Chris Caso ","Yes. Thank you. I guess, first question is about the content opportunity between the premium tier and the mass tier phones when the transition of 5G and I guess, in the 4G generation, most of the content was in the premium tier phones and that was \u2013 if I look at your total content opportunity, that was the largest part of your mix. ","Does that shift somewhat as you move to 5G, because you are moving those mass tier phones from such low content to something? How does that changed your sort of mix exposure of the total revenue between sort of premium tier phones and mass tier phones. Obviously, realize mass tier phones represent more volume? ","Bob Bruggeworth","Right. That\u2019s an excellent question really and I mentioned a little bit ago seeing \u2013 not unusual to see $10 to $12 worth of our content and sometimes even higher in some of our China-based handsets which are primarily mass tier that are at the higher end today. But that\u2019s what\u2019s driving down into the mass tier as we speak. ","And so, if you look at kind of percentage increase from 4G to 5G, it\u2019s much, much higher there. It\u2019s more like a 2X in content now and as we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s not only adding the 5G proper, if you will, content, but also bringing all the 4G up to higher levels of capability as well in each of those 5G handsets. ","So, to your point, we see content increases in the premium tier for sure. But as a percentage of the total there, more on the order of, call it, 20%, 25% of content increase, where in the mass tiers seeing more like a double or even more of content. So it does tend to mute the mix effect slightly I would say as we go into 2020. ","Chris Caso ","Yes. It\u2019s helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about ultra-wide band and obviously, you did an acquisition in there. I guess, how important is ultra-wide band to you in terms of revenues today? And I guess, where do you see it going not just within handsets, but also opportunities for ultra-wide band in IoT types of ICs, how significant could that be?","Bob Bruggeworth","Right. It\u2019s another good question. We \u2013 as you probably know, we are the leading supplier of ultra-wide band front-ends today into the mobile handsets although it\u2019s a relatively small market today, but it\u2019s really just emerging and I think between the fact that, it\u2019s now beginning to penetrate mobile handsets, we believe it will eventually be absolutely required in every handset. ","That combined with the fact that the connected car consortium has adopted the technology for future keyless entry systems. We think this is really just the very beginning of an inflection point. We are absolutely thrilled to be adding Decawave, a fantastic company. Great people, great technology. They\u2019ve been at this 15 years really pioneered as we said the technology. ","And so, we see beyond the automotive and the mobile applications, we think a whole host of both consumer and industrial IoT applications are there as well. So, when we look forward by 2024 modeling, it\u2019s $2 billion to $4 billion worth of additional TAM and we think there will be just a few people positioned to capture it. So, pretty exciting. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Ed Snyder ","Great. Thanks a lot. Eric, on China, how much of your strength there, I mean, is from \u2013 I want to general post to different factors that are affecting China, because it\u2019s obviously becoming a very big part of your business. But \u2013 so, if you could maybe give us some idea of the \u2013 how much of it is coming from 5G content upside versus 5G be pushed into more phones than we expected versus OEMs moving their old 4G Phase 2 designs to modules. ","So, 5G content versus units versus the shift to modules in 4G, if you could and what percentage of your revenue do you think you are getting from China at this point? And then, James, it sounds like Defense is not only acting as you expected, but also leading the charge. Maycom just announced on their call last night they are finally getting to again on silicon carbide. ","So, I am trying to get an idea of how sticky are the applications for your GaN on SiC in both 5G base stations? And then, if you could talk some degree about how that applies to Defense too? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Bob Bruggeworth","Right. So, regarding the first part of your question, the strength we are seeing throughout China right now is largely driven by 5G content. That\u2019s the primary driver. I think I spoke in the last quarter about seeing the need for more like, dual signaling capability for example, driving additional switching and antenna work. ","And then, I forgot what, all three of the categories at the bottom would be the modules in 4G-only handset. That\u2019s probably the least impactful. Right now, the insight is heavily driven by 5G and mostly content more than units. ","James Klein","This is James. So, I mean, certainly, we believe, we\u2019ve got great technology with our GaN and have been doing very well in the Defense market and we are seeing GaN grow well north of what the market is growing. And so, we also continue to make investments in scale and in reducing our cost, we think are key enablers to that technology to continue to proliferate. ","As far as stickiness, I mean, obviously, in Defense, that market is characterized as long cycles in programs. And so, I would consider that a very sticky market. In base station, we are seeing the trends go just about like what we\u2019ve talked about for the last couple of quarters. We are seeing massive MIMO systems to deploy and we are also seeing GaN take significant share from LDMOS. ","And so most of those are great trends for us and we are capitalizing on those trends and I think it\u2019s a good part of how we are going to able to turn the business around fairly quickly. ","Ed Snyder ","Thanks a lot. And then, for my follow-up, Eric, if I could, Broadcom announced the supply agreement with Apple \u2013 like, I can\u2019t remember this week or last week. And I know it\u2019s probably more of a frame of your empathy slightly is $15 billion et cetera. Last time they did this which is some years ago assuming two or three years that fall that agreement were marked by lack of content for Qorvo in there. ","So, how does this change the landscape or does it at all in your view irrespective of they keep the business or not and what does that do for the mix of your \u2013 not just your BAW, but your revenue, does it shift more to China in the upcoming two years or so or do you even have any indication of that? ","Eric Creviston","Well, frankly, it doesn\u2019t have any particular impact on our investments today. We are picking our battles and investing in areas where we think the highest win probabilities are. It\u2019s a target-rich environment right now for integrated modules, as well as for discrete components based on BAW technology. ","As I said, we\u2019ve got lot of advancements coming in the BAW technology and well placed great relationships across the industry and across all base band manufacturers and tiers. So, the announcement itself and our understanding of what it includes does not impact our current best plans. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the deals you said it closes in February. Is there anything you can wrap around that in terms of revenue and OpEx contribution? And then I have a follow-up, thanks. ","Mark Murphy","Yes, Blayne, we will provide more. It\u2019s not a material amount of revenue and it\u2019s an increase in OpEx. It\u2019s all reflected in our guide and it\u2019s dilutive in the near-term. ","Blayne Curtis ","Got you. And then, Mark, I know this is preliminary guidance. Just a little confused on the seasonality here. You are seeing all the strength in China. Usually, Apple is not stepping down as much in June. I am just trying to understand what you are baking for sequential decline in June?","Mark Murphy","Yes, Blayne, I am not going to go any more detail. What we\u2019ve provided is our best view given current demand signals and then adjusted for some risk factor in what is a very uncertain situation at the moment. So, doing our best to provide you at least a directional call that far out. I think the concern as we sit here today is, right now, the channel is lean and healthy. ","The demand signals have not been yet been affected. But we do have the Chinese New Year will wrap up and people will take stock of what\u2019s going on with this health situation in China and elsewhere. So, I think, we are just being mindful of that and providing some sort of directional view for you. ","But in the June quarter, it\u2019s still a story of what you\u2019ve heard on the call today about 5G-related handset growth, content associated with that growth, continued Wi-Fi growth, Defense strength and infrastructure recovery. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. ","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Just first question is for Mark just on the acquisitions. I think you said immaterial to revenue. But you said, was it $500 million in terms of total cost to both? ","Mark Murphy","Yes. ","Craig Hettenbach","Could you maybe just help frame just kind of the opportunity over the next couple of years in terms of how maybe sizing like that that business in terms of where you see it potentially going?","Mark Murphy","Yes, I mean, most of the purchase price is associated with the Decawave acquisition. In fact, over two-thirds of it. So, over three quarters of it. So, the \u2013 and that is a technology investment as Eric said, it\u2019s a technology for a market that we think is a several billion dollar market in a number of years. And that\u2019s going to take time to develop and it\u2019s largely immaterial revenue and dilutive. ","The smaller acquisition, Custom MMIC is a Defense bolt-on in the very easy to integrate right in James\u2019 wheelhouse on defense products, advanced technology defense products. We see in the \u2013 for the part of the March quarter that we haven\u2019t integrated. It will provide about $3 million of revenue that quarter. And on a full quarter basis, it will be roughly $5 million or so for the near-term and it\u2019s accretive immediately. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company. ","Raji Gill ","Yes. Thank you. A question on the RF infrastructure market wins. When do you expect that to rebound? Any color in terms of what you are seeing with the mobile operators in terms of deploying these base stations across the world that are some regions that are trying to catch-up, others starting to slowdown? Any color there in terms of RF infrastructure would be helpful.","James Klein","Okay. This is James. So, we definitely are seeing deployments gone predominantly today below 6 gigahertz predominantly in China. What\u2019s helping us and talking about recovering our business is we are seeing massive MIMO continue to take more share if you want to talk that of that share of base stations and that\u2019s a big content \u2013 big for us. About 10x of what we would have in macro base stations. So that\u2019s driving the recovery. ","I think the absence of Huawei is obviously a challenge in the industry, because it\u2019s about 50% of the share. But as we said in Bob\u2019s prepared remarks, we are ramping with our third customer in that space. So I think that will fuel to recover the business. Deployments, look about our own track, little bit of share mix changes in the last quarter. ","But it appears that they were somewhere in that 400,000 or so base stations that were deployed last year and it looks like that will grow about 50% this year. So somewhere in that 600,000 base stations deployed. MIMO content will probably to go up to maybe 20% last year, 30% or greater this year. ","So, positive trends and we urged yesterday about some frequency allocations in the U.S. and we hope that that will also spur development to push forward in the United States.","Raji Gill ","And I\u2019ll follow-up you talked about GaN taking share against LDMOS base station. What\u2019s driving that transition? What\u2019s the catalyst for that?","James Klein","Yes, three-fold, one is the move to higher frequencies in GaN\u2019s performance manages higher frequency. Also broader bandwidth, so to say with 5G and again, GaN has a better ability to deal with those higher or broader frequency levels. ","And then in some cases, just higher output power. But in general, the technology is very well suited to move in these directions that we\u2019ve talked about before of higher frequency and broader bandwidths. ","Operator","Our next question comes from \u2013 excuse me - Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. ","Srini Pajjuri ","Thank you. A couple of clarifications. Mark, maybe you can talk about how many 10% customers you had in the quarter and also, if you could give us what percent of the mix in mobile was China in the quarter? ","Mark Murphy","Yes, so, we had two 10% customers in the quarter and I don\u2019t break out by region or sales by quarter. ","Srini Pajjuri ","Got it. And then, is it fair to say that Huawei is still kind of minimal on the mobile side or did it grow in the quarter?","Mark Murphy","Yes, Huawei was one of the 10% customers actually and it was stronger than we expected along with the other Asia-based handset producers. I said on the call \u2013 the last call that we expect that Huawei to be about 5% in the second half. They were larger than that in the December quarter. So, that statement is still correct. It\u2019s just that the \u2013 obviously the waiting is not uniform across the second half. ","So, we expect them to be about a 5% customer in second half. Obviously, largest portion of that in the December quarter. I think it\u2019s important to note here that that we are seeing broad based strength related to 5G across Asian handset producers and importantly, across all chipset producers. And I think the March guide drives home that point. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. ","Vivek Arya ","Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong results. First one, I am curious what does the shape of the 5G handsets rollout look this year? Is it kind of more balanced first half, second half? Is it more 60%, 70% back half weighted? When I look at the 300 million or so market size, it\u2019s much higher than what others are in that closer to 200 million. So I am just curious how you are seeing the 5G rollout? What you have seen so far? And what do you think the shape of the year looks like for the market? ","Bob Bruggeworth","I would say, it\u2019s pretty uniform across the year. Obviously, we are getting to a very strong start. The concerns that Mark had about coronavirus and so forth might impact demand and supply. We will see how it goes. But I wouldn\u2019t have any other more specific comment on profiles.","Vivek Arya ","Okay. And for my follow-up, there has been some concern about the base of wireless deployments. We heard that from Xilinx and Texas Instruments. I am curious if you would notice any of those slowdowns? And I apologize if you answered this already, but what are you baking in for your base station sales going into the March quarter? Thank you. ","Mark Murphy","Yes, I mean, what\u2019s really been driving our recovery is again massive MIMO. For us, as we get that shift, we get about a 10x content lift. So I think if we were only in macro or only looking at a macro view, I would say, yes, we would see the deployments going slower and the business being slower. ","But because of content pickups, and on top of let\u2019s now being able to compete in the power amplifier slot with GaN, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really fueling, maybe a bit difference with us in some of the other folks in the business. Now that said, we are still way off our historical highs from where we had been a year ago or so. ","So, a long way to go before we recover from the restrictions on being able to shift to Huawei, which again I\u2019ll restate as about 50% of the market at this point. ","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks for joining our call tonight's. We hope to see many of you at our upcoming investor events and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much, Brad. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings conference call.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.

Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone. I'm proud of the Qorvo team for delivering a strong September quarter, with both revenue and EPS well above guidance. Our products and technologies make Qorvo uniquely positioned to partner with our customers to develop their most compelling products.","Our September quarter extends a strong start to Qorvo's fiscal 2019. We are investing in the right types of growth and a customer design activity is demonstrating that our technology competes at the highest levels.","Operationally, we're making progress related to cost control and capital efficiency, including increased production of 8-inch BAW, continued capacity expansion to support GaN demand and the up-fit of Farmers Branch. We're doing a good job of growing our top line, expanding our margins and improving our return on capital.","During the quarter, we supported a series of large product ramps and enjoyed robust design activity in both Mobile Products and IDP. The relentless demand for an improved user experience is fueling large macro trends, such as the deployment of LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, as well as the proliferation of the Internet of Things. These trends are creating new design challenges for our customers, requiring more RF content and placing a premium on performance, product and technology breadth, systems level expertise and integration.","Qorvo is a leader as the industry moves to more highly integrated solutions, enabling wider bandwidths, increased data rates and enhanced system performance.","In IDP, revenue grew to $218 million, led by strength in the base station market. IDP continues to connect and protect across a diverse set of defense and communications customers and applications.","Qorvo's 28 gigahertz high power amplifiers were selected for 32-element phased array deployments, targeting large venues with dense cellular traffic, such as concert halls, convention centers and sporting arenas.","Shipments of 5G solutions were a record in support of multiple leading base station customers. GaN based revenue increased 27% year-over-year, driven by broad market demand, including 5G infrastructure.","Design activity for 5G base stations has been robust across geographies and customers. The emphasis is primarily on sub-6 gigahertz, while millimeter wave applications continue to gain traction.","We're in the early innings of 5G, and the migration to higher frequency, increasing bandwidth requirements and deployment of massive MIMO favor Qorvo's technologies.","As deployments of 5G base stations accelerate, our 5G product revenues are forecasted to be strong over the next several years.","In IoT, new markets and applications continue to proliferate. Field trials are underway for cellular, vehicle to everything connectivity, and Qorvo is supporting multiple OEMs with our 5.9 gigahertz FEM, optimized for Qualcomm's cellular V2X chipset solution.","We were selected by Continental, a leading Tier 1 automotive supplier, to deliver multiple solutions enabling always-on automotive connectivity to cellular networks around the world.","And in connected home, we commenced shipments of a dual-band Wi-Fi iFEM powering Facebook's family of portal video communication devices. We also partnered with a lighting and IoT solutions company in China, enabling smart interior lighting products, which operate on ZigBee 3.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 protocols.","Among new product launches, we introduced the fully integrated system and package for ultra-low power wireless communications that's certified to ZigBee and Bluetooth product specs and delivers ZigBee Green Power energy efficiency.","Turning to Defense, the deployment of phased array radars and higher frequencies of operation are increasing demand for RF solutions that leverage GaN, gas and other semiconductor processes.","During the quarter, Qorvo enjoyed strong demand for our solid-state GaN Spatium high power products for electronic warfare and communications applications.","In Mobile, revenue increased to $667 million. We supported the ramps of flagship smartphones. We increased our content on key customer programs, and we helped to enable early 5G smartphone designs.","Qorvo's Mobile Products revenue is expanding across product categories, and our product and technology development efforts are opening up new opportunities for growth.","During the September quarter, we enjoyed robust demand for our antenna tuners, ETP mix, BAW-based quadplexers and RF Fusion Phase 6 solutions.","RF Fusion Phase 6 leverages Qorvo's premium BAW and SAW filter technologies to deliver complete main path coverage in two placements: a low band module and a mid-high band module.","During the quarter, we commenced shipments of RF Fusion Phase 6 in support of Vivo's newest flagship smartphone, the Vivo NEX. Integration is an industry trend, and Qorvo was built for this.","In 5G, smartphone design activity is accelerating across leading manufacturers, primarily in support of sub-6 gigahertz deployments. Qorvo was selected by Samsung to supply our 3.5 gigahertz FEM for a series of a 5G handset demos across multiple base bands.","We also commenced sampling the industry's first dual-band 3.5 gigahertz and 4.9 gigahertz FEM to a leading China-based smartphone manufacturer. Our customers expect commercial shipments of 5G devices as early as the second half of calendar 2019.","Next, let's drill down for a closer look at 5G, given our broad participation across both IDP and Mobile Products. Each quarter, Qorvo gains new insights into 5G, related to geographies, timing, customers and architectures. We're enabling global 5G base station deployments today and helping to develop the 5G mobile devices of tomorrow.","Qorvo introduced the industry's first 5G RF front-end for smartphones, and we've participated in nearly every 5G infrastructure field trial, including the Seoul Winter Olympics. We are a voting member of 3GPP, helping to define 5G standards, and we are collaborating closely with network operators, base station manufacturers, smartphone manufacturers and chipset providers on their 5G programs.","In the base station market, 5G is helping to drive a rapid shift in power amplifiers from silicon LDMOS to GaN. We expect the trend to accelerate, with approximately half of the power amplifier market transitioning to GaN in the next few years.","Compounding this, we expect the content opportunity for Qorvo to increase substantially as fixed antennas are transitioned to massive MIMO phased array deployments. A 32-element array requires 32 PAs and 32 small signal chains, and that continues to scale with 64-element and 128-element arrays.","On the device side, 5G is increasing the content not only in smartphones, but across an expanding set of new products, from fixed wireless solutions and nomadic devices to end-to-end nodes and autonomous vehicles. Each 5G smartphone will retain full 4G capability, and a great deal of that 4G content will be redesigned to coexist with the 5G bands. The added complexity is a huge opportunity for Qorvo, as performance requirements are increasing across nearly all components.","In both IDP and Mobile Products, Qorvo's leadership in premium categories like envelope tracking, antenna tuning, premium filters and phased arrays are already playing a critical role in the definition of 5G architectures.","In summary, the demand for data is growing, RF content is increasing and the commercial traction is expanding for Qorvo's highest performance and most highly integrated RF solutions.","The Qorvo team is successfully executing our strategy, and we're confident in our growth and margin drivers. We're pleased with our September quarter and our outlook remains strong.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the second quarter was $884 million, $29 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 28% sequentially and 8% year-over-year.","Mobile Products revenue was $667 million, a 37% sequential increase and reflected strong seasonal ramps. IDP revenue was $218 million, another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth, with particularly strong demand in Infrastructure.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the September quarter was 47.7%, 20 basis points over our guide. Our margin outlook remains positive as we transition the mix of our product portfolio, improve factory utilization and drive productivity.","Operating expenses were in control at $168 million, down slightly from our guidance. We expect OpEx to trend down slightly through the back half of the year, with full-year OpEx ending at approximately 20% of sales.","Non-GAAP net income in the September quarter was a record $225 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.75 or $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance.","The earnings power of the business is increasing as we grow in the right areas and remain disciplined in capital and operating spend.","September quarter cash flow from operations was near $215 million and CapEx was $70 million, yielding free cash flow of $144 million. CapEx is currently projected to end the year a little over $300 million and remains principally for BAW and GaN capacity additions at our Texas fabs.","We repurchased $87 million of stock in the quarter and ended the September quarter with $558 million of cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we redeemed our remaining 6.75% notes, due 2023 and repurchased $436 million of our 7% notes, due 2025. Also, in the quarter, we issued $630 million of 5.5% notes, maturing in 2026.","With these actions, we've lowered our interest costs and extended our average debt maturity to 2026. We are below our long-range \u2013 our long-term leverage target and retain significant financial flexibility to grow the business and return capital to shareholders.","Turning to our outlook. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $880 million and $900 million, gross margin to increase sequentially to approximately 50%, and diluted EPS of $1.95 at the midpoint of our guidance. We currently project Mobile Products revenues in the December quarter to be up slightly sequentially in support of seasonal phone ramps.","For China, we see a relatively healthy channel, but given the strength from China-based handset manufacturers' year-to-date, we are taking a measured view on demand in the back half of the fiscal year.","We expect IDP to post another solid quarter with strength in infrastructure, offsetting near-term weakness in Wi-Fi.","On gross margin, our December quarter guide reflects ongoing progress improving the portfolio, utilizing our fabs and driving productivity. We expect gross margins in the back half of the fiscal year to average 50% or more.","Operating expenses are forecasted to decrease slightly in the December quarter to approximately $165 million. We're maintaining a full-year non-GAAP tax rate forecast of approximately 8%.","We expect operating cash flow to strengthen in the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue, stronger margins and lower working capital.","In the third quarter, CapEx is expected to peak for the fiscal year with BAW and GaN capacity investments in Richardson and the continued build-out of BAW capacity in Farmers Branch.","So in summary, the September quarter was a record revenue and earnings quarter for Qorvo. Our portfolio strategy and operational improvements are yielding stronger and more consistent results.","Looking ahead, our outlook remains essentially unchanged with full-year revenue growth around 10%, gross margin increasing to 50% or more for the fiscal second half and OpEx in control and ending at about 20% of sales for the full fiscal year.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll open the floor for questions. And our first question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Happy Halloween. Congratulations. Stellar execution on the top line, but also congratulations on the margins. Mark, I had one for you. Just looking beyond sort of the second half fiscal that you talked about, now that your factories are mostly BAW, and now that you're kind of set with your share at some of the large Tier 1 guys, should we think of 47%, 48% to 50% as sort of the new range for you guys going forward? And I've got a quick follow-up.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And your question, Harsh, was around gross margin?","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes, sir.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we're not giving quarter guidance. I would, certainly beyond the quarter we're giving \u2013 and we've talked about second half guidance for gross margin. I guess the question is, what should gross margin do if we execute on our plan?","And we believe that we have the potential to expand gross margin going forward. And we believe there are a number of reasons. One is, we know this year that the SAW under-utilization is headwind for us, and we expect that to some effect in the near-term, which would include early next year. We also have, that will wane through this year and then into next year, so become a lesser effect on the business.","We're also continuing to affect the mix transitions that we want to occur with BAW related revenue, GaN and other premium technology products, and that will have a positive effect.","We are being very disciplined around capital, and as our capital efficiency improves through larger wafers, die shrinks and other things, we should see those effects help with the margin. And then there's, of course, other productivity, better yields, lower inventory charges, improved cycle times. I can go on and on. The team is working on a lot of things.","I'd say, lastly, we are tightening relationships with our supply chain, developing selective partnerships, joint productivity programs and other things to broaden the scope of our productivity efforts.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. And then maybe one real quick on IDP. We've heard from several other companies talk about weakness in a variety of different areas, infrastructure, generally from everybody has been positive, suggested by you guys as well. But there are other parts of your business in IDP that are broader. Maybe, Bob, you could take this one or somebody else in the IDP team, help us understand the different parts and pieces, the pluses and minus around those sub-segments in IDP?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Harsh, this is James. As you said, we did have a very strong base station quarter across all the OEMs. It was driven by strength in both 4G and 5G deployments, and we also saw a strong demand for small cell and massive MIMO products, including very early deployments for 5G. That includes material orders for GaN to support those MIMO deployments.","And on top of that, we've also done very well with share gains, particularly in one of our European OEMs. So, very strong growth in base station.","We did talk a little early about Wi-Fi. So, we have seen some effects in our Wi-Fi business that we think are relatively near-term. We think that slowdown has been based on the delays in the release of the AX standard. We also have customers experiencing some shortages in other materials that are affecting their production, and some impacts of tariffs as they transition some of their manufacturing locations.","Defense, we're off a little bit of our record highs that we experienced back in the back half of last year, but that business is typically a bit lumpy. What I would say about both Defense and Wi-Fi, the fundamentals are both very, very strong. We do see that the technologies we have are matched very well with where we see both of those marketplaces going.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Thomas O'Malley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned a more measured view on demand from China into the December quarter. Can you kind of give us some puts and takes on where you're seeing that weakness from the high-end or the low-end and just give us a little more color there?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, this is Eric. I can give a little more color on that. We mentioned in last quarter's call that we had seen a very strong market year-to-date and that a lot of the high-end handsets had just launched and we are waiting to see how the sell-through goes there. Obviously, we've got a lot of content and a lot of the high-end handsets there. So, I think that's the area that we're most conservative on now. Just keeping an eye on it, as Mark said. Sort of a measured view to see how those sell out.","Thomas O'Malley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then one quick other one and I'll hit on the margin point again. You guys, obviously, are seeing some great improvement here and this quarter a lot of that is obviously bringing your premium part through at the high-end and some premium smartphones. Can you talk about what that was like bringing that through and kind of what you're seeing going forward with that product?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Sorry, Tom. I'm not sure we fully understand your question. I will say this, the ramping of our BAW facility is going extremely well. I commented on that before. I'm very proud of what the team's been doing and fantastic ramp in what we've seen and we're looking forward to continuing to grow our BAW-based business.","Thomas O'Malley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Hello, Mr. Peterson. Your line is open.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry about that. I was on mute. Congratulations on the strong results and guide. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, coming back to China, and I think there's a view that the domestic China market is fairly weak, and you commented as your content tends to be in some of these flagships maybe global phones. But, I guess, as we look into next year and assuming unit volumes still kind of remain muted, what can drive content growth? Are you seeing further opportunities for diversity receiver antennaplexing? Or what are the areas where you can drive content further from here in China?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","It's a good question. I think the opportunities we see may be centered around integration more. As those customers look to pack more features in and, in particular, prepare for 5G capability, people are generally taking more of the handset portfolio up the integration curve. So, Phase 6, as an example, where we combine the entire main path into two placements, we think that's just a great opportunity for Qorvo to see that really penetrate further and further into the handset portfolio.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then secondly, for James. When we think about the GaN business, it says 27% growth and it sounds like you're gaining share as well. As you look at, I know that we're just at the very, I guess start of the 5G ramp, how should we think about the growth of that as we look into next calendar year?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, as I've stated many times, I mean we see that overall GaN market again, defense, broadband, cable and wireless infrastructure, that market is going to grow in the low to mid-20s. I think we'll do significantly better than that as we go forward. You saw that in this last quarter. That was driven a lot by Defense, but we are now really beginning the start of production deliveries around these 5G deployments and massive MIMO deployments.","I think one thing I want to talk a little bit, while we're on massive MIMO is we definitely are seeing the OEMs start those deployments. Over the next couple of years, probably maybe three years, we expect that 20% or 30% of the RUs will be massive MIMO antennas. What that does for us, it results in about a 4x of the number of channels, about a 8x to 12x increase in content for us. So, that's going to drive a significant amount of GaN demand as we go through these deployments in 5G over the next several years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruben Roy with MKM Partners.","Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. James, I'd maybe just follow-up on that point around GaN and the 5G. Is that related to sort of the higher frequency base stations that you're looking forward to? Is that kind of the content growth that we could expect as those ship? Or are there additional content opportunities as we move over to those high-frequency base stations for 5G over the next few years?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","I would say that the content is certainly today, as Bob talked about in 6 gigahertz and below. In the out years, we believe millimeter wave will continue to gain traction, and we're certainly supporting multiple different millimeter wave opportunities around the industry.","As far as the breakout of below 6 gigahertz, we're seeing strength both in Asia deployments and deployments in the U.S., and so you'll see a little bit of different frequency band selections. Predominantly, I would say, we play in a little bit of the higher end of frequency ranges, but it's relatively broad-based at this point.","Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks, James. And then a quick follow-up for Eric, just around the China commentary. Number one, can you remind us what your exposure to China is? And then number two, in terms of the commentary on the channel remaining relatively healthy; so it sounds like the component inventory is healthy? Or do you think it's a combination of component inventory and actual handsets out there? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, so in terms of Mobile exposure to China, it's about 30% of the business goes to China, not including Huawei, the broader customer base in China. And regarding the channel inventory, we've got visibility, a very clear visibility into our component inventory in the channel and we know that, that is quite healthy and in line. We don't have quite as good a visibility on the final handset that \u2013 a little bit of a delay, but our own component inventory is clear.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. A question regarding your capacity utilization \u2013 sorry \u2013 capacity expansion plan that's underway for next year. Can you talk a bit about the visibility on the design wins needed to fill that capacity and your level of confidence? How much is perhaps design wins that have already been won? How much are sort of high probability design wins? I'd imagine now that you're guiding to 50% gross margins, the goal is to keep it there. What's your level of confidence?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, this is Mark. We're not going to talk about customer-specific programs and handicap those. What I can talk about generally is our expansion plans. I think we've talked at length about our utilization issues on SAW and we continue to work through those. We do believe SAW is a critical technology for us, and so we will maintain SAW capacity and we have good technology and we'll deploy that in Phase 6 and other areas, particularly in BAW-related applications.","As far as gas (29:49) capacity, it is well loaded in Oregon and North Carolina. And then BAW capacity, you heard James talk about GaN, so we're fully loaded there, and then we've got our BAW capacity in Texas, which currently is production's all out of Richardson, and Richardson is at capacity.","Currently, about 70% of our capacity in BAW is on 6-inch and 30% is on 8-inch, and we are undertaking over the next year between wafer conversions and bringing Farmers Branch online, bringing on more 8-inch. So, this time next year, we will have actually the reverse of what we have now, roughly 30% 6-inch and 70% 8-inch.","And based on our current plans, which also include not only that wafer conversion, but also die shrink programs, yield improvements, cycle time, all these other things, we believe we have the capacity to meet what we believe is our revenue outlook.","Now we're continuously reviewing that plan and update the spend plan when needed as we consider opportunities, the pace of tool conversions, new tool lead times, technology and process changes, and other factors, but hopefully that gives you some color as to our thinking on capacity.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. If I could just follow on with that explanation, and then based on what you said, it sounds like then the sort of variability in capacity, depending on how design wins go, would be the loading on the 6-inch fabs then and you would swing that higher or lower and therefore get the efficiency benefits of loading up the 8-inch fabs. Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","It's hard to say, Chris. It's just a very complex, continuously assessed situation, and it may \u2013 you could slow the conversion. You could slow various technology programs. You could accelerate them. It's just, you know, I gave you what our current view is sitting here on October 31, and we'll give you an update periodically as things change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. Wanted to come back \u2013 I think in past calls, you guys had mentioned sampling custom mid-band, high-band PADs to multiple customers. As you look into 2019, what's your just sort of market share assumptions or what's your market share opportunity as you ramp both Phase 6 designs as well as the opportunity for other custom mid-band, high-band PADs into next year?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Eric. Yeah, I think we're working with virtually all of our customers with these product types, and there's \u2013 in terms of specific share, it will vary by customer of course and product type. But we're clearly one of only a few people that can do this, and when you combine it with our high-performance SAW, our leadership in tuning, switching and power management and advanced packaging, we really like our odds. We've got a lot to bring to the party. We're helping customers design fantastic products and helping them get ready for 5G. So, there's a lot of excitement around a broad portfolio of products for a lot of customers.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. And then just a quick follow-up for you, Eric. Looks like your business was, drove most of the upside in the September quarter. Just kind of curious, was that across the board, or was that primarily driven by the new platform ramps where you guys have talked about your content gains? I guess, I'm specifically trying to ask whether China actually grew with the business in September or whether it was really more the marquee phones launching for the second half.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I would say the growth was fairly broad-based across nearly all of our customers and skewed towards the marquee platforms, I would say.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks a lot. I'll start with Eric. How do you feel about \u2013 let's talk about 2019, anytime in the year is fine. BAW-based DRxs, you guys dabbled in that with Samsung, couple of years ago, but haven't done any since then. I think last quarter you mentioned that some of the BAW expansion that you're looking at in Farmers Branch is to accommodate what look to be increasingly-probable design wins in that. If you can maybe help, give us an update on that. And if you could talk, are we talking about one or two BAW filters? Or are we talking about more of that, because some of those modules can get very large.","And then, James, if I could, IDP's infrastructures, your shipping GaN into MIMO, but what does that ramp look like specifically in Infrastructure? Because most of your GaN goes into Defense at this point. What does that ramp look like over the next several quarters? Do you expect to see significant increase? Or are you going to kind of status quote here as they evolve? Thanks.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, picking DRx first. We continue to invest in BAW-based DRx modules. We see clear opportunities with the increasing mid and high-band DRx and as MIMO comes on-board and so forth. The one that's we're developing have combination technologies, but majority of which are BAW-based and we are seeing technical differentiation in some parameters. And so, we're still targeting second-half calendar year next year for first production.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Ed, this is James. So, let me talk about massive MIMO. So, we definitely are seeing strong order demands right now. For us, that's much broader than just GaN, because we're supplying the components that affect the rest of the transmit side plus the vast majority of all the components that go into the receive side as well. So, that demand is going today, and I talked a little about what we see content-wise.","As far as the GaN portion of it as well, we do have significant production orders on the books now and we're in the process of building and producing those. And in that section of the \u2013 I agree with you that Defense is certainly still the strongest part of our GaN portfolio, but the base station is going to grow at a rapid pace and will outstrip the overall growth of GaN.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. James, you're doing double duty today on the call, and I'll come back to you with a question as well. What's the right way to think of the longer-term growth for the business? It's been very strong for you, guys, 20-plus percent year-over-year growth for several quarters. But these last couple of quarters, it's in the mid-teens, which is, again, nothing to scoff at.","But if we look out ahead over the next few quarters, it sounds like base stations and GaN and \u2013 am I framing it correctly; those are the big drivers? And then, how to think about it. Is it the mid-teens grower? Or should we expect an acceleration. Then, I had a quick follow-up for you, Mark.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, so we're in line with what we shared at Investor Day. Growth is tracking those underlying markets and they're growing between 10% and 15%. And as I've said before, I think we'll do a bit better than that.","The Defense and Wi-Fi have pulled back a bit. But again, I think the underlying trends are very, very positive in both of those markets. And once AX takes hold and some of our customers adjust their manufacturing plans, I think you'll see Wi-Fi start to take off again. But I think we'll grow just better than those underlying markets and, again, in that 10% to 15% range.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And just to be clear, James is talking about annual numbers.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Oh, yeah.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Going forward.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, annual numbers.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, right. That's what I was asking. Great. Thanks. Mark, just a quick one for you on the CapEx side. You said in the third quarter CapEx peaked. So, could you just remind us, so then we should then expect it to trend back to the longer term? And then, what is the longer-term intensity? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, so, we expect this year to be between 3% and 3.25%. So, given the guidance that we've given, that would put it just under 10% of sales for the year. And the CapEx as a percent of sales was down sharply last year to 9%. We thought it continue to go down, but as we said we brought some of this spend for Farmers Branch in, so we're just a little bit higher than we expected. We expect CapEx as a percent of sales to resume a downward trend next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. First question on gross margins. So, you had about 50% or so right now. How much more headroom is there? What are the drivers? And I think you mentioned, you still have some headwind from SAW, so how much is that? When can it disappear? Just the trajectory of gross margins over the next four quarters to six quarters?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, so we're not going to give guidance on gross margin, Vivek, beyond the current quarter and the next quarter, since we've given half year. What I can say is again, we're focused on investing in the right technologies and developing the right portfolio. We've talked about that at length; large markets, fast-growing markets, hard-to-do products.","Secondly, we're maintaining utilization of the fabs, selective investments, driving down capital intensity. And then third, we're just operating better and with greater discipline and driving continuous improvement.","Yeah, the lift in margins sequentially second quarter to third, it's up about 230 basis points. About half of that, well, a little over half of that is continued product and customer mix.","And then the remainder is net lower cost. So factory productivity, lower inventory charges and partially offset by some price and also the adverse effects of \u2013 actually, sequentially the effects of SAW, the SAW underutilization are actually less in the third quarter than they are in the second on a percent basis, not on a \u2013 and an absolute dollar basis.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. For my follow-up, maybe one for Bob. Bob, I understand you don't want to be specific about customers. But if you look back, typically when are decisions made around what content you will have at your various large customers? Because that does tend to swing a lot from year-to-year. So, just give us a sense for, at what point in the year \u2013 I assume it varies by customer \u2013 but at what point in the year, would you have good visibility on how next year would shape up? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Vivek. This is Eric. I think based on our past experience for the flagship OEMs or leading OEM, phone designs, we would typically see down select decisions six months to nine months prior to phone production.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I had two. First of all, Mark, I think you said that you thought that half of Mobile Products in the third calendar quarter would be China. Did that come in as about half? And what are you baking in for the mix in December? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Tim, I don't believe we've given details on the mix within business in a quarter. But what I can tell you is, we had two 10% customers, one of which was a large China-based OEM. And then you know our largest customer, so.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Of course. Okay. And then I guess I had a question whether you thought that Mobile Products outside of your biggest customer, do you think that the other Mobile Products revenue was it up, down, or flat in September? And what are you assuming for it in December? Seems like it's probably going to be down.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","No, we -","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","We're not going to forecast by customer mix...","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, we're not.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","...and \u2013 sorry. We're not going to go there, Tim. I understand the nature of your question and why you're asking, but we're not going to give you that granularity at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Mark, you talked about CapEx and capital intensity potentially reverting lower next fiscal year and beyond. Given that backdrop, how should we think about cash usage going forward? If you can comment on M&A and shareholder return, that would be great. And then on shareholder returns specifically, have you guys debated a dividend internally at all? Thanks.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Toshiya, no dividend at this time. We do forecast strong free cash flow generation going forward and we certainly have the balance sheet capacity and cash flow outlook to grow the business, including inorganically, and return cash to shareholders, which now is done through share repurchase. We did buy, as I mentioned, $87 million in the quarter. Outside the ASR, I believe that's the third-highest quarter of repurchase we've done. We've done about $187 million in the last six months. So, higher than the free cash flow generated over that period. So, we've returned more than all of our free cash flow to shareholders.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as a follow-up, one for Bob. Just given the trade tension between the U.S. and China, have you sensed any change in posture or operations among your Chinese customers in the form of pull-ins or projects being delayed or anything of that sort? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Let me start with a little broader comment that we've assessed the impact on us from the different sets of tariffs that have been imposed by the U.S. and China, what's been imposed so far. And so far, all that's been immaterial on our business. James mentioned, we've got a couple in the retail space, non-handset that have been looking to move their supply chains. But as far as China-based handset customers, no, we've seen no change in their buying behaviors, patterns, what they're doing for their supply chains, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cody Acree with Loop Capital.","Cody Acree - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Bob, maybe following on to that last question, you've been insulated by these program ramps in these mid, high-band wins. But to what extent are you factoring in or looking at a risk-based scenario of the broader market slowdown that we've seen echoed by many of the analog companies on a very broad base, with that working in and maybe eating into some of the secular growth drivers?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Let me start with, Cody, I think as James has already pointed out, we think we've started to see some of that in his business. We've got some strength in some areas. The growth in 5G is offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing. His Infrastructure business is strong, and yes, we've seen some in the retail area.","As far as our Mobile business goes, we've modeled for the whole year. We didn't expect the handset industry to grow. We didn't expect the handset industry or consumption of handsets in China to grow either this year. It's been primarily around content. So, a lot of that thinking that now some people are seeing, we took a conservative view from the macro perspective earlier in the year.","Cody Acree - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And then just lastly, in your Mobile business, the RF Fusion, RF Flex integrated products, can you maybe give us some color on percentage of your mix and how those integrated products have been growing, and maybe what your expectations are for the mid-term on that as a percentage of revenue?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. So today, the vast majority of our business into the China ecosystem, if you will, is the RF Flex parts, which are not as integrated. I think virtually all of our customers are now either in production or will be in production with a Phase 6 type of phone to test the benefits of the integration, performance and so forth. So today, it's relatively small, less than 10% of our sales into the China ecosystem. We expect it to grow significantly next year, as you can imagine, based on the traction we're seeing now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Krysten Sciacca with Nomura Instinet.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura Instinet","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results. So as many of us know, a few of the marquee phone launches this year were a bit delayed or launched later than usual. Can you maybe just talk in a very general broad sense what you're seeing in terms of seasonality for this year for the December and March quarters versus what you've seen historically?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Krysten, I appreciate the question and understand why many investors might want to know that answer, but like I've said on prior calls, we're not going to comment on how future customer programs are running and things like that. I think we've given you guys enough color on at least the entire industry of our business with the guidance that we provided for this quarter, Mark's opening comments about what we expect to grow for the year. And I think that's really enough information that's needed at this time.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thanks. And for my follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that for 5G, some of the prior 4G content will need a redesign. I was just wondering, if you maybe delve into that a little bit more and maybe discuss how much content that will \u2013 how much 4G \u2013 how much increase in content for 4G that will lead to for 5G handsets.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, Krysten. This is Eric. I'll be happy to speak to that. We talked about this a bit at our Analyst Day as well and we've learned a lot since then, of course. We do see some brand-new bands coming into the handset, a lot of activity right now around 3.5 gigahertz bands and 4.9 gigahertz bands, which will be dedicated 5G bands. So, that's all new content.","But when you put those in and you also look at taking the 4G in the phone fully up to LTE Advanced Pro \u2013 and that's going to be important for any 5G handset, because when it isn't in a range of a 5G base station, you're still going to want to \u2013 some sort of competitive throughput and so you'll see virtually all 5G phones have LTE Advanced Pro as a baseline. So, there you've got full 4x4 MIMO, 256 QAM, high-power amplifiers and so forth. So, we see 5G handsets having significantly more 4G content. And that's why in total in CY20 we think the effect of 5G on the RF10 for us is about $1 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Eric, just to follow-up on the previous questions. Some of the U.S. carriers are talking about rolling out 5G on lower-frequency bands, I guess T-Mobile is talking about 600 megahertz and Sprint 2.5 gig. I'm just curious, in that case do you still expect incremental content, whether it's 5G or 4G, given that's these are lower frequency bands?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, it's a very good question. Yes, we do, although the effect is not as great, of course, in those bands as when you add completely new bands. But when you run the 5G modulation through that, it does affect what power amplifying, switching, filtering and everything around those bands and of course, it gets harder. It never gets easier when you're pushing more data through a phone in any band. So, we do see some impact from those bands as well.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then for my follow-up, Mark, I know you don't want to talk about customer-specific demand. But if I look at your March quarter implied guidance for fiscal 2019, you seem to be implying about down 10%, which is much better than the last two years. I'm just curious as to what's driving that better-than-seasonal guidance for the March quarter.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I'll let Eric answer that since this is a mobile-specific driver.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I think we've talked about opportunities with Samsung, in particular, where we have much greater content. We've talked for some time now about new opportunities with Samsung's phones, both this fall with ultra-high band as we've now discussed, and then a big step up in the spring launch with a much higher integrated platform there. So, that's going to be a bit of a tailwind for us in March.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. If I may, I'd just like to go back to the last question. I was curious whether your content uplift in March is exclusively focused on mid-range models or tie more to flagships, because I think your prior guide was dependent on ramping on a particular model at that key customer in the March quarter. And I had a follow-up, please.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","So, forgot exactly the way you phrased it. But if you're asking about the less than seasonal decline or the offset to seasonality maybe, it's a mix.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","One, the \u2013 probably the biggest driver is flagship content and then, but also a continued just migration towards more Phase 6 phones with our China customers, too.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. I guess despite all the near-term consternation on automotive, it would seem your IDP business tied off automotive continued to scale very well with two notable design wins in the quarter. It would seem this business should do or should continue to grow above the segment average. So, I was hoping you could just talk about the content opportunity you see within your automotive business over the next 12 months and really just kind of how large you see that revenue opportunity for you over the next 12 months as well. Thank you.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Hello. This is James. So, we are seeing significant traction with our focus on the AEC qualified parts, particularly Wi-Fi, satellite radio and the VDX systems that Bob talked about in his remarks. We are \u2013 our Cat 4 and Cat 6 products are shipping into car models early next year. So, I think that's when we'll start to see the first really material revenue. And then, Cat 16 products will support 2022 models. So, we're still in a pretty long design cycle for the automotive business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. A question on 5G infrastructure, just given that's probably one of the stronger parts of the market right now. Can you talk about kind of your visibility into that market and how you kind of see it shaping up as you go through 2019?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Any specific to what you're talking about? Market in general or \u2013 I guess I wanted to clarify.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, for 5G infrastructure. The inflection that you're seeing now just kind of how you're seeing that trajectory into 2019 and the type of visibility you're getting for customers into that as of right now?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I think we are definitely seeing the ramp beginning now. We've probably have been in the strong ordering pattern, certainly for the last several months. We're anticipating that to be strong for the next several years, very similar to what we saw in the 4G rollouts that we had several years back. So, sustainable. It looks well-behaved from our perspective as far as number of base stations are going to get rolled out.","Now what's different for us this time than 4G rollouts early on is a content story. So, because of the massive MIMO that I talked about earlier, that drives significant content increase for Qorvo. And because of our GaN capabilities, we're now able to supply the power amplifier slot, which we weren't in 4G rollouts back a few years ago.","So, again, I think it's normal ramp what we saw back three or four years ago and I think we'll be able to play in a much larger role, because of MIMO and GaN.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Eric. I appreciate the comments on how you're seeing the China handset market. For Qorvo, specifically, you mentioned another 10% customer. Can you just talk about how you're feeling this from kind of a market share perspective and what type of momentum you're seeing in China?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, the second 10% customer has been a great customer for us this year. We've been building business through content gains and getting a higher presence on their platforms, both their flagship platforms as well as their mass tier platform.","So, it's been a great story for us this year and, of course, we're overall the leading supplier of RF2 to all the other big suppliers in China as well. So, overall, it's been just a great, great year for us in China and a lot of excitement again about the new technologies that we're working on together for next year.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","We want to thank everyone for joining us on tonight's call.

At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much, Chelsea.","Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.

Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone.","Qorvo's solid June quarterly performance was highlighted by broad-based strength across our markets, customers and products. We enjoyed strong demand during the quarter in both Mobile and IDP, and the team did an outstanding job supporting large customer ramps, while securing new opportunities for growth.","By business, IDP quarterly revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $207 million, while Mobile revenue for the quarter grew 7% year-over-year to $486 million. The June quarter represented an excellent start to fiscal 2019 highlighted by strong smartphone unit volumes in China, design win activity and operating discipline.","Qorvo is laser focused on portfolio management in markets that value our capabilities and offer exceptional opportunities for growth. Within these markets, we bring key enabling technologies like BAW, SOI and GaN, a robust product development engine, manufacturing scale, and decades of industry know-how.","Turning to IDP, quarterly performance was driven by record revenue in wireless connectivity and growth in base station solutions. IDP is reaping the rewards of portfolio management in diversified markets including the connected home, the connected car, Wi-Fi, base stations and defense. These are expanding markets underpinned by positive secular trends like the deployment of LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, the proliferation of gallium nitride, and the Internet of Things. IDP partners with industry leaders and wins with differentiated products and technologies.","Revenue for IDP's IoT applications increased over 30% year-over-year. In Wi-Fi, we are a leading supplier of front-end modules for tri-band distributed Wi-Fi systems. In these systems, our BAW filters maximize spectral efficiency and our PAs increase power-added efficiency. As the IEEE governing body and the Wi-Fi Alliance work to extend spectrum for 802.11ax, our Wi-Fi portfolio is expanding to include solutions in the 5.9 to 7.1 gigahertz range for products ramping in the second half of 2019.","In the connected home, we're very pleased to support the next-generation SONOS Beam soundbar with our iFEM, integrating a BAW filter for interference-free streaming. In the connected car, we are engaged with multiple OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers in joint development activities for next-generation automotive connectivity. Beyond the connected home and the connected car, our IoT opportunities are expanding to include a diverse set of emerging applications like electronic shelf labeling and commercial and retail lighting.","In infrastructure, it's clear the demand for data is driving up carrier base station investments globally. They are deploying LTE Advanced Pro, networks to enable narrowband IoT and to build the foundation for upcoming 5G rollouts. We continue to see growth in small cells and massive MIMO and expect our business to expand as these markets develop. During the quarter, we extended our 5G leadership by introducing several new products for massive MIMO and 5G macro base stations. Our expanding 5G portfolio supports all anticipated frequency bands for 5G architectures up to 39 gigahertz.","Given the superior performance characteristics of gallium nitride versus legacy silicon technologies, we see GaN proliferating in multiple markets including base stations. Our GaN solutions support massive MIMO deployments below 6 gigahertz. In China, demand is increasing for Qorvo solutions for the 3.5 and 4.8 gigahertz deployments anticipated in 2019. In millimeter wave, Qorvo's 39 gigahertz GaN front-end modules are powering the first commercially available millimeter wave fixed wireless access service which was recently deployed in Boston, L.A., Washington and additional cities to be added later this year.","In defense, the demand environment continues to be driven by greater performance, increased efficiency and more highly integrated system solutions. Qorvo is the recognized leader in GaN for defense applications and a trusted foundry for the U.S. Department of Defense. Our GaN solutions deliver distinct customer advantages including higher power density, smaller arrays, lower power consumption and several orders of magnitude improvement in reliability from its current technologies.","We recently introduced two highly integrated X-band front-end modules optimized for next-generation active electronically scanned array radars. Our newest GaN modules leverage Qorvo's scale and integration capabilities to combine four parts into one providing the smallest and highest performance FEMs for mission critical radar systems for customers around the world.","Turning to Mobile Products, as we laid out at our Investor Day, Qorvo is repositioning our portfolio to target and win the highest growth, most complex opportunities. We're leveraging core enabling technologies like BAW and SOI to transform our business with a focus on our differentiated solutions.","Today, we're investing to win in mid and high-band PADs, diversity receive modules, antennaplexers and RF Fusion variants for our low-band PAD. As architectures evolve, many of these products including antennaplexers and diversity receive modules offers opportunities to grow our BAW-based revenue.","Qorvo also enjoys broad-based growth opportunities in antenna tuning and envelope tracking. We're developing our fourth generation ET technology and we see a long runway ahead, given the performance requirements of 5G and the challenges of its higher bandwidth and peak-to-average power ratio. In antenna tuning, demand for Qorvo's industry-leading solution is growing with the advent of LTE Advanced Pro, MIMO and 5G, very simply.","New functionality is requiring that the antenna count go up, while the board space available for these antennas continues to be reduced due to industrial design factors. That requires antennas to be miniaturized which weakens their bandwidth capabilities and adversely affects antenna performance. Qorvo is the leader in antenna management and our antenna control solutions address these challenges to vastly improve the user experience.","It's worth noting that this dynamic is no longer limited to premium-tier devices. Customers in China are adopting Qorvo's multiplexing and antenna tuning solutions, as well as our RF Fusion Phase 6 for their increasingly sophisticated flagship smartphones. We posted record revenue for our BAW-based quadplexers in China during the June quarter and we're very well positioned as the performance-tier smartphones increase in functionality and adopt more highly integrated Phase 6 architectures.","Qorvo's RF Fusion for Phase 6 features our BAW and SAW filter technologies to deliver complete front-end coverage in two highly integrated placements. Just as we outlined at our Analyst Day, we see multiple avenues for growth in Mobile as global demand for data continues to acquire more and better RF.","Before handing the call off to Mark, I want to say a few things about our recently announced changes to the operations team including the addition of Paul Fego. First, I'd like to thank Steve Grant and Jim Stilson for getting us to where we are today. Steve and Jim have been instrumental in creating our world-class manufacturing platform. Since we started Qorvo in 2015, Jim and Steve have led the charge to implement our global operations strategy, and together they've helped position us for the growth and opportunities that we see today. We appreciate their continuing contributions as Paul gets up to speed.","Paul joined our team earlier this week bringing 35 years of global large-scale semiconductor manufacturing experience with well known and respected semiconductor companies. Paul's deep experience in front-end and back-end manufacturing with both high-volume and high-mix operations aligns perfectly with Qorvo's operational and business needs. He will lead the further consolidation of our global operations from wafer fabrication through assembly and test and we look forward to his many contributions as we continue on our lean journey.","Looking across our entire organization, we believe we have the right people, products and technologies to capture an expanding set of long-term growth opportunities. We are positioned to be a primary beneficiary of global macro trends in LTE Advanced Pro, 5G, IoT and GaN. We're investing in the highest growth segments in the markets we know best and we're differentiating with technology to win across markets, customers and products.","And with that, I hand the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone.","Qorvo's revenue for the first quarter was $693 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range. Mobile revenue of $486 million was higher than expected across multiple customers and particularly strong in China. Mobile returned to year-over-year growth in the quarter which we expect to sustain through the rest of the fiscal year. IDP revenue was $207 million, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the June quarter was 44%, in line with our guidance. Our margin outlook for fiscal year 2019 remains positive and unchanged from previous guidance, as we grow our top line, optimize our product portfolio, improve factory utilization and drive productivity. Operating expenses were $160 million, up less than expected due primarily to timing of program development expenses. Non-GAAP net income in the June quarter was $124 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.96 or $0.21 above the midpoint of our guidance.","June quarter cash flow from operations was $75 million, reflecting inventory builds to support Mobile Product ramps. CapEx of $44 million was primarily related to BAW and GaN capacity additions in Richardson. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter. Cash at quarter end was $334 million, down from year-end cash of $926 million due to the repurchase of the remaining $429 million of our 2023 notes and from increased share repurchases.","Following quarter end, we completed a partial tender for $300 million of our 2025 notes and a $500 million eight-year unsecured notes issue at a coupon of 5.5%. With these actions, we've lowered our interest costs and extended our average debt maturity to 2026. We remain well below our net leverage target and retain significant financial flexibility to grow the business and return capital to the shareholders.","Turning to our outlook, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $850 million and $860 million, gross margin to increase sequentially to approximately 47.5% consistent with previous comments, and diluted EPS of $1.62 at the midpoint of our guidance.","On revenue, we expect IDP to post a stronger September quarter helped in part by the recent lifting of the U.S. Department of Commerce's ban on ZTE. For Mobile, we see sequential revenue up over 30% on seasonal ramps. On gross margin, our September quarter guide reflects expected progress on mix improvements and productivity gains partially offset by under-loaded SAW capacity. We expect gross margins in the back half of the year to average 50% or more.","Operating expenses are forecasted to increase in the September quarter to approximately $170 million, principally driven by increased design activity. We expect OpEx to trend down in the second half, totaling less than 20% of sales for the full year.","We're lowering our second quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate forecast to approximately 8%. We expect operating cash flow to strengthen in the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue, stronger margins and lower working capital.","CapEx is expected to increase in the second quarter primarily due to BAW and GaN investments in Richardson, expansion of BAW capacity in Farmers Branch, and the purchase of a leased facility. Our CapEx for the rest of the year remains tied to design opportunities, tool conversions, new tool lead times and other factors. Currently, these factors point to moderately higher CapEx this fiscal year primarily driven by acceleration of our build-out of Farmers Branch as we gain confidence in our BAW-based revenue outlook.","We believe this increase is for the right reasons, value-creating investments supporting our high-growth and high-margin businesses where we hold differentiated positions. As a result, our free cash flow forecast for the year is now expected to be closer to $700 million.","So, in summary, we posted a first quarter well above our guidance. Looking ahead, we expect full year revenue growth around 10%, gross margin increasing to 50% or more for the second half, and full year OpEx below 20% of sales.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. And our first question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Bob, congratulations, a lot of good things happening in the quarter. Mark, I wanted to ask a question about your 10% full year growth forecast. You've obviously given us all the way through September. Can you provide us maybe some color on how we should think about December? Is that expected to be up? And then, any more color you can give us low\/mid-single-digits whatever? And then, how should we think about March? And then I've got a follow-up after that.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure, Harsh. And we're not going to give specific guidance on revenue in the back half, but what we can say is based on what we see now, we do see a sequential increase second quarter to third quarter, so our September quarter to December quarter. As you would expect, we would see seasonality with a decrease into the March quarter. Normally, that seasonality has been sort of 10% to 15%. And if we were to right now call are we going to have on the high end of that or the low end of that, we would say that we'd probably have on the low end of that.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","This is very helpful, Mark. And then for my follow-up, historically, Qorvo has been sort of the third content guy at the large customer. But I believe this year, you are benefiting from a strong ramp in content. Would you be able to give us some idea, maybe some color on what kind of content you're looking at in terms of uptick? And also, does this mean that you're now quite possibly the number two supplier content-wise to the large guy?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Harsh, this is Bob. And first of all, thanks for your opening comments. We're not going to be able to answer any future comments about any of our customers for that matter. What I can tell you, Harsh, is what I am very proud of the organization and what we've done as far as developing the technologies and products that our industry needs. I think with the way we're positioning the portfolio today, we believe we can grow as fast as the industry or slightly faster than the industry, and I think I'll just leave it at that for this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Cody Acree with Loop Capital.","Cody Acree - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and let me echo my congratulations. Maybe to that last question a bit differently, just the strength that you've seen in your mid and high-band PAD and you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, can you just talk about any other successes that you had and when you might expect those ramps \u2013 not just PAD, other mid type (21:23) and designs?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, this is Eric. I'll be happy to take that. We see backed by the general trends that we covered I think pretty thoroughly on our Investor Day of our customers looking to add a lot of band coverage and in particular, mid and high-frequency bands extending up to ultra-high band now looking at additional carrier aggregation requirements and multiple bands at once being covered there, and those are generally in the mid and high-frequency ranges because of antenna sizes and so forth, all of that really is driving a need for more BAW filtering and in more and more cases, we see those being integrated into higher level products, whether it's in Phase 6 which is our primary workhorse of the future for our China-based customers for the most part, all the way up to the highest tiers of the flagship phones, and it is also across multiple product categories. It applies to the main path obviously and also receive diversity path. For the same reasons, we think BAW has key advantages. And as we looked at sharing fewer and fewer antennas with more and more radios, antennaplexing as well is going to be of more importance. And there, again, that's really almost entirely BAW-based products.","Cody Acree - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And Eric, thank you for that. Can you just delineate a bit of the health in China you're seeing in unit demand, and just any comments you have on some of the second\/third tier OEMs and any pricing sensitivity that you're starting to see in that second\/third tier market?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Right. So, overall, we \u2013 obviously, from our results last quarter, we had another pretty strong quarter with March. We're real proud of the team what we've created both in terms of product portfolio as well as applications and customer support throughout China. We're, if not the largest, we're very close, but in most cases, we're the largest supplier to all the leading handset suppliers throughout the region.","And we've seen both I think a refilling of the channel in some cases, which is kind of in the lower and mid-tiers, but also a lot of our customers have brought out some fantastic new flagship products. And these are really compelling products. Industrial design is very, very good. The feature set is good and competitive and they're having a lot of success so far. So, still a little bit early. We need to see those handsets continue to sell on through, but at least in the June quarter, we saw pretty healthy uptick across a wide range of our customers and our product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ambrish with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to the reported quarter and you had a very big upside on the top line, but I was wondering why there was no fall through on the gross margin side? And then, I have a quick follow-up, please.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Ambrish, so you're right that in the quarter with a higher revenue, the SAW utilization drag which we anticipated had less of an effect principally driven by that higher revenue. But we did have, as you can see, a higher mix on Mobile which goes against us. Within Mobile, we had a higher mix in China. And then, I would say also in IDP, and James can talk about this perhaps later, a bit weaker mix in IDP.","So, the positives of the higher revenue and the lesser effect of SAW was offset by these mix effects both across the segments and within the segments. I would just note, Ambrish, we're in line with the guide and the September guide is in line with my previous comments.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, clearly, you are guiding for what you've said before. And then, just a real quick one on ZTE, when do you expect it to get back to the annual run rate that you had given last quarter, I think it was $40 million?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Ambrish, this is Mark. I'll take that one as well. For ZTE, we already see them returning to historical levels and we've got that built into our second quarter forecast and we've got it reflected into the rest of the year at those levels. Now, we've taken a bit more conservative view on parts of China just to make sure that our forecast remains intact there. But, the ZTE effects and the normal run rate of that business is back in and we're certainly pleased that they're a customer again.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I just want to add that was $40 million for the year, just to be clear.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","$40 million for the year, so $10 million a quarter, Ambrish.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini with Macquarie Securities.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Mark, just to follow up on the gross margin question. I guess, as we move to the second half of the fiscal year, your guidance implies I think low 50% gross margin. I'm just wondering, is it pretty much a function of SAW utilization getting better and then BAW mix getting better? Are there any other puts and takes? If you can give us any color on that, that'll be helpful.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. The drivers for the margin expansion in the second half remain consistent with what I've talked about before. As the revenues grow, the impact of the SAW and the utilization becomes less impactful. Also, the costs related to that, we continue to work those down, so that helps us as well. And then, it's fundamentally driven by a change in more favorable mix, BAW-related content and then just continued improvements in the overall fab utilization.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then to follow up I have a 5G question maybe for Bob. Bob, I think in the press release you mentioned you have a new design win at 3.5 gig. I'm just curious where we are in the 5G cycle. Is that design win for 5G? And then, there's also a lot of talk about rolling out 5G in lower frequency band, for example in a 600 megahertz and also 2.5 gigahertz. So, I'm curious, if 5G gets implemented in lower frequencies, around 600 megahertz to 2 gigahertz, is there any incremental content? Or is it going to be similar to what we saw with 3G and 4G in terms of the absolute content? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Srini. I think what's great is both James and Eric can answer your question. So, I think we're going to take some time and make sure that there's good clarity between two businesses because I did talk a lot about 5G in both of the businesses. So, if you don't mind, I think we ought to start with James and talk about 5G and some of those questions. Then, Eric, if you'll, pick that up after that.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start by IDP and really talk about where we see the infrastructure going. We have recent design wins and key product demonstrations really around the world and I think these reflect our leadership position in 5G. There's pilot deployments going on in numerous cities and really across the broad spectrum of products, so all the way from very low frequencies that you mentioned earlier up to 39 gigahertz. The infrastructure rollouts appear to be on track for 2019, so that's probably a bit of an acceleration on what we've talked about in the past.","We also see 5G rollouts driving some nice underlying trends like the proliferation of GaN to be used in massive MIMO systems. So, we are now shipping in volume power amplifiers into massive MIMO deployments that are intended to support the early rollouts of 5G systems. So, I would say in general, the infrastructure rollouts are somewhat ahead of what we've been discussing in the past.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","And on the Mobile side, there's a tremendous amount of activity. Of course, we're generally working with customers looking out two to three years which is well into the deployment of 5G. The 3.5 gigahertz ultra-high band design win that we mentioned is not 5G yet. It's notable though as we see that range which will become in 77 being one of the first bands to deploy 5G in commercial handsets from the road maps we see. And so, being an incumbent in that band we think is important at getting the content.","When you look at 600 megahertz and you asked whether there's additional content, for example, if you roll out 5G, I think that's a really important question. People tend to talk about 5G as a bolt-on to 4G, in the early rollouts. It's really anything but when it comes to the RF; you can't bolt on something in RF. Anything you add impacts everything else that's there.","So, if you take 600 megahertz to 5G, you're going to add more requirements on that band. It's going to have to be a higher performance band, but it's also going to affect isolation and so forth characteristics of other bands near that. So, as soon as we see 5G coming into the handset in any band, it will affect the content throughout the handset.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Burton with Benchmark.","Mike Burton - The Benchmark Company, LLC","Hey, guys. And thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results. Just wanted to follow-up on China for Eric, I guess, first. You mentioned it was strong in the June quarter. Can you help us size the Chinese OEM business for you? And what are your expectations for that business in both the September quarter, but also longer term if you could help us understand the content uptick with Phase 6?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. So, in terms of sizing it, the China business excluding Huawei was over 30% of Mobile revs last quarter, so it's fairly substantial. And in terms of dollar uplift with the Phase 6, it varies from what the baseline is. For the most part with Phase 6, we're integrating the entire functionality into two placements. So, in terms of dollar opportunity for us, it raises us from some percentage of the total to the entire total. So, we are able to take all the main path content at least with the Phase 6 solution. And in terms of dollar content in total add, it depends upon what the customer is starting with, so it's really hard to identify a number with that.","Mike Burton - The Benchmark Company, LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then second one for James. A lot going on in your business for us. When you look ahead, how would you rank order your growth opportunities for the businesses? Are you starting \u2013 I mean, is it really kind of 802.11ax or the initial 5G deployments now or something else? And how should we think about that in the biggest opportunities for both this fiscal year and for next?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I think you go back to those underlying trends that we talked about. We talked about the deployment of 5G which is driving significant content for us in our base station business. We're seeing that in this year as well. And we're seeing that with massive MIMO and small cell deliveries continuing to increase and actually becoming material in our base station business as we go through the year. So, I would say 5G is going to drive growth.","On top of that, we'll also have significant growth in IoT and that will be both in the low-power side, our SoC portfolio that's going to support everywhere from connected home to retail commercial lighting to now this shelf tag opportunity we've talked about. And on the higher power side, it's going to support all of our Wi-Fi systems.","So, those are growth drivers. And then on top of that, defense remains very, very steady growth engine and that's really driven by that other underlying trend we talked about which is the proliferation of GaN. We do see GaN growing actually significantly faster than what we had talked about the market doing. And we are winning in defense. We're winning in our broadband area. And as I stated earlier, we are now starting to win in the base station. So, first production deliveries are going out now for these massive MIMO GaN-based systems and that is becoming material revenue for us.","So, again, to recoup, it's across IoT, it's across 5G and it's across GaN that's really the big drivers of growth in the business.","Mike Burton - The Benchmark Company, LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruben Roy with MKM Partners.","Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. First question for Mark, I just wanted to run through the OpEx commentary quickly. You mentioned some design activity driving the Q2 outlook up a little bit. Is that sort of broad-based design activity or sort of big customer related, if you can just kind of walk through that? And then, to get to the less than 20% for the year, that would imply some meaningful downticks in Q3 and Q4 and maybe you could just walk through what's driving those downticks in OpEx. Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Ruben, we've been clear that OpEx for us \u2013 much like our business is seasonal, OpEx can be seasonal. And so, there are a number of programs across the business, many different customers and it will fluctuate based on design cycles and size of programs and the amount of prototyping and so forth. So, some of that pushed out of the June quarter and we'll pick a little bit up of that in the September quarter, but it's just again more design activity that we foresee in the September quarter. And we just \u2013 and given our outlook on design activity, overall it continues to become harder and harder to make the decisions on what to spend money on. So, we're certainly trying to keep OpEx in check, but it will wax and wane based on seasonality.","Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Mark. And then, a question for Eric. Just on 5G, you guys talked a lot about that. But I'm just wondering, I've been hearing uptick in 5G commentary from a number of component companies. Would you say that there's been any sort of \u2013 has some of the design activity been pulled in there would you say? Or is it kind of in line with what you guys were thinking when we talked about it at the Analyst Day? Thanks.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. We were the first to bring a 5G product to market. It's been well over a year now. So, in early 2017, we announced the first one. We've had dozens and dozens and dozens of engagements and we've been working on this quite a while. So, I guess, from our perspective and especially since Analyst Day, really, we don't see anything changing. Everything seems to be on pretty much the same pace it has been from the beginning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Just a question with regard to the CapEx and if you could talk about what's given you the incremental confidence to make that CapEx investment. Is that your overall weight of the business? Are there actual confirmed design wins that are supporting that CapEx? I mean, generally, if you could just help us to assess the risk that that CapEx will in fact be utilized as we go forward over the next year or so?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, it's a good question and maybe it's easier to talk about in the general context of free cash. And we're there very thoughtful about CapEx, it's a very difficult decision for us and want to start with that, because we've been targeting $800 million of free cash, we gave a range of $700 million to $800 million. We're feeling now that given the CapEx view, it's going to be down to around $700 million, could be less, could be more, difficult to call at this point.","And just for some color, the CapEx we thought we have this year was, on a dollar basis, about the same as last year which is $270 million and we thought this year would trend down as a percent of sales. Now, given what we've seen on BAW requirements in fiscal year 2020 and beyond and the level of design activity, timing of tools, which you know at this point is tight and other factors, we just thought it was best to accelerate expansion of Farmers Branch and get out ahead of that. This acceleration of Farmers Branch will require, we think, $50 million or more this fiscal year and so that we certainly didn't anticipate in the quarter.","Now, some things we didn't anticipate either, right, like taking out the lease and a couple of other investments here and there, but you can normally, you have things that you can offset that with reduced expenditures elsewhere, but this is large enough that it's changed our CapEx view and our free cash view.","Now, what do we get for the spend? Now, we had already planned to spend money expanding Farmers Branch, doing a lot of conversions at Richardson. And so, now we're projecting to spend around $200 million and that'll provide us about this time next year, we'll have 75% more wafer capacity than we have now. Now, when you layer in the die shrink that we're doing and other productivity programs, yeah, you end up with over 2x the amount of capacity by this time next year for that incremental investment.","So, today, we're about 75% 6 inch; next year this time, we expect to be about 75% 8 inch. And we'll have \u2013 a lot of that will be at Richardson, of course, but then we'll finally have Farmers Branch up and running this time next year.","Yeah, we're continuously updating this plan as we've done here. We're trying to spend only when we need to spend and what we need to spend, but while considering the opportunities we have in front of us, the pace of tool conversions that we can do, the new tool lead times, the technology and process changes we want to introduce and other factors.","So hopefully that helps, Chris.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That is helpful. I guess as a follow-on to that, the natural next question would be what does this mean for gross margins as we go into next year. And the benefit you're having in the second half of this year is filling up that BAW capacity that you had installed earlier. Can those gross margins be sustained next year in the 50% range despite the fact that you're adding this additional CapEx and...","(42:03)","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Right now, Chris, and that's what's sort of prompting us to accelerate the investment. Our line of sight right now is that we'll continue to keep the fabs loaded excluding the SAW fabs we have in the near term. We certainly appreciate the pain of not having the fabs loaded. Long term, we still believe that below 10% of sales on CapEx is what we're going to have.","And then on margin, it's fundamentally going to be driven by reinvesting in the right technologies and developing the right portfolio which we made clear at Investor Day, largest markets, fastest growing markets, hardest products to do. Are we going to maintain utilizations at the fabs which to your point are we making selective investments, are we driving down capital intensity which we believe we are. And then finally, are we achieving the operational discipline and continuous improvement that we want to see and where we think we're on a great track there with Bob's leadership, introduction of Paul and others.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on CapEx as well. Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about an improved BAW-based revenue outlook. I was hoping you can elaborate on that. Is that more tied to adoption in China going forward, or is it higher market share at your largest customer, or both?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","I think, Toshiya, it's pretty much our view of adoption of BAW and our confidence in competing and it's widely ranging, right? It's Phase 6 activity we're seeing there, it's Wi-Fi, it's 5G, it's other areas and diversity. And so, I think Eric is probably the best to expand on it.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I think Mark hit on the key points. It's really broad based and I think the increase in confidence in particular quarter-over-quarter is about our ability to address with BAW the adjacent segments of diversity receive and the antennaplexers, that's probably the biggest change quarter-over-quarter, and just looking at the timing of when we're going to need both high-volume samples, as well as volume production capabilities to support those markets.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as a follow-up, we hear a lot about component shortages, and I think some of the passive components, MLCCs in particular, you're seeing significant tightness. Is there an impact on Qorvo from a cost perspective or in terms of your ability to ship to customers?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Bob. I'll go ahead and take that one. Number one, we're not seeing a disruption where it's impacting our ability to capture the revenue. We have longstanding relationships with many of these suppliers. We're not seeing any price changes. We continue to march down their technology road maps very much aligned with where they're driving the industry, and so far, so good, pleased with how the team has been handling this. You're correct, that tightness has been going on actually for quite some time and we've been taken care of and we appreciate that from our suppliers.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Eric, I'm a little bit surprised to hear about Farmers Branch. Up in the past, you've said that you expect you can fill most of the big secondhand ramp in BAW out of Richardson, most of that actually on the 6-inch lines, which you had upside protection on that. Is that still the case, or are you expecting maybe that you're going to \u2013 a little bit sooner than it's possible. And if so, I know the qualification of that fab, you've got a preliminary one which is not the complete qual on it (46:10) and so you're probably talking several months here. You mentioned high-volume prototype runs followed by production. Is visibility in BAW on those type of products, which are very vertical, improved or changed significantly over the last several months that gets you rolling on Farmers Branch earlier? And then I have a follow-up for James, please.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Let's say \u2013 I believe the beginning of your question was about the question, what's driving most of the growth in the BAW utilization and how it's going to be servicing Richardson and nothing has changed there in terms of the primary path. Marquee handset-based integrated modules with mid and high-band content, that is the bulk of the growth and that's what's driving it. What we're talking about here is now pulling in Farmers Branch by a quarter or two to where the CapEx falls into this fiscal year as opposed to next fiscal year essentially and that's timing just of our entry into these adjacent markets, diversity receive and antennaplexers basically.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah and just to be clear, Farmers Branch is not going to be operational for customer parts here this fiscal year, it'll be next fiscal year.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","All right. So, based on those comments, it sounds something like Farmers Branch is most of the adjacent markets, etcetera. Where are all the quadplexers that you're shipping into China going now? It's kind of split, isn't it? It's not coming out of Farmers Branch, is it?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Zero out of Farmers Branch. Everything that we're producing is BAW-based today. The BAW filters are being made at Richardson.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. And then, James, if I could, it sounds like mix works against you this quarter. Was that more Wi-Fi, less defense in GaN? And if you could maybe, postulate a little bit, what does it suggest when 802.11ax finally shows up in handsets next year? I know it's been delayed a bit, but some of the flagship guys are going to have it in the phones and I expect 802.11ax start seeing a lot more use which will probably pull-through to your side of the business too. Would that affect your mix on a gross margin significantly if that were to occur faster than you thought? Thanks.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. So, the first comment about mix in the quarter I think was largely correct. So, a little bit more in our consumer side products and a little bit less in our defense-based world so that mix works against this event. Defense has typically been a little bit lumpy for us, although on a great trajectory going forward. So, I think we'll get back to mix and we're pretty comfortable with how we'll execute towards the model throughout the whole year.","As far as \u2013 802.11ax has delayed a bit. And I think once 802.11ax does come online, it will be another significant growth driver for us in Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi has been doing great, but this will be that next big growth spurt. We are way out ahead of it. We're getting on reference designs, and in most cases, we're either primary or secondary on all of the 802.11ax reference designs that are out and we're also expanding the portfolio to encompass the new frequency bands that we believe are coming. So, yes, short answer is, yes. It will drive the next growth spurt.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is for James and maybe piggybacking, it sounds like some of the IoT is coming in better. You're getting some sooner production for GaN and 5G, ZTE has come back. Should we think of this business being on track to kind of return to mid-teens type of grower this fiscal year, and then what will be driving that?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're still on track for what we said at Analyst Day which is our underlying markets are growing 10% to 15% and we believe we'll do at or better than what those underlying markets will do and it's certainly too early to call the year. Great start, as Bob stated in the first quarter, at 13%. And I think we'll just continue to track at above market growth rate as we go forward.","What's going to drive it is, is that story we just talk about over and over and over. IoT is going to drive it, that's going to include Wi-Fi and our low-power systems. The base station market is doing very, very well for us, as I talked about earlier, and that's that proliferation of massive MIMO and 5G really starting to come on board. And then GaN is just continuing to be pretty aggressively up into the right. And so, those trends are very much holding true and I expect they will hold true for the year.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then my second question, assuming the positive growth trends continue in IDP, that would kind of suggest obviously you said earlier you expect further year-on-year growth in Mobile in the September quarter, but can you help parse out some of the unit demand versus content gains? And in particular, obviously, China came in better in the June quarter. Are you expecting, I guess, directional weakness based off of sell-through trends? Or help us understand why it seems to be modest growth overall in Mobile in the September quarter, if you could help us understand the puts and takes there, that would be great. Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Bill. This is Eric. So, we still are not expecting much overall in terms of units in the market, so it's content growth primarily. Our handset customers in China, of course, are dealing with the domestic market which is clearly going down significantly year-over-year. They're making up for that with some pretty terrific progress in the export market. The content in those devices varies widely from region to region. So, it affects the projections for the dollar content mix.","Going into the second half, we're basically kind of banking the shrink we saw in June, not expecting \u2013 not counting on that continuing. It very well might, but we're assuming at least that the China will be filled and demand will relax back down for now until we see differently.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. First one also back on June quarter and China. You beat your results by almost \u2013 the June quarter number by almost $40 million versus midpoint of what you had set before and you're saying China contributed a lot of that strength. What's your kind of visibility into sell-through trends there? Is there any risk of any kind of inventory adjustment as they go through the next two to three quarters?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Vivek, I guess, what I was trying to imply in my last answer essentially, we have very good visibility of our channel inventory now, so we are confident our channel inventory is healthy. In terms of handset inventory, that's a lot harder for us to gauge, right? We see the product announcements, we see forecasts from our customers. By the time we see sell-through, sometimes it can be late and that's why we're trying to be as conservative as we can here and hold our component inventory, the thing we can control, as tightly as we can.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as my follow-up, I think in the past, you have mentioned BAW getting to 30% of the mix and then 50% longer term. Is that dependent on taking more share from your larger competitor? Or do you think that is essentially just a broader adoption of BAW across your customer base?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Vivek. This is Bob. It's really what we see in the market. We see tremendous opportunities for BAW. We've mentioned antennaplexers, diversity receive modules, we talked about mid\/high-band PAD in multiple configurations to go with our Phase 6 and others that by discrete. So, we really see it much more of a market opportunity for us. I think again, the good news is we've now got our technology where it's as good as what we see out in the industry, in the market, and we've got people who now know how to make it, design it and sell it. So, we're gaining our confidence in our ability to participate in a great growth area.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. I had a question on base station in particular GaN adoption. If you can just elaborate on what you are hearing from customers from a design perspective, and maybe just clearly there're some advantages, but also some push-backs around kind of costs. So just how you're seeing GaN develop as you go into 5G for base stations?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Let me talk specifically about us and how we're moving into the market. So, what's in front of us today is really a move into massive MIMO using our GaN power at plars (55:33). So, we've got production orders on the books and we're shipping, we see that as a fantastic growth opportunity for us to support that market.","The very high power macro PAs that are also proliferating in the market are beginning too. We see those as opportunities that will start building in the pipeline next year. They will be focused largely above 3 gigahertz. So, in that 3 to 6 gigahertz range. And those frequencies in 3 to 6 gigahertz are largely driven around 5G. So those are in part driving GaN type solutions. But again, GaN is growing, industry models are showing in the mid 20s. And for us, we see our GaN work growing significantly faster than that.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Eric. I know there's been a lot of focus on the China smartphone market, but just as you see things and then maybe this is in context versus a year ago or so, but just how you feel about your market share position within China and things to think about there going into the back half?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, I think we're certainly the largest RF supplier to the handset customers there in China and happy to be in that position and look forward to maintaining it again. The products that they're bringing to market are world-class and it's inspiring to see what they're doing to innovate and add value to their customer set. Again, they've dealt with their contracting domestic market and responded beautifully with a great job of exports. And so, we're happy to be a part of the market and we're investing to make sure we maintain leadership there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Just Mark, back on the question about China and Mobile, it sounds like it was about half of the Mobile business in June. Is it right to think that it will be down maybe 20% sequentially on a dollar basis in the third calendar quarter? And I guess on that, whether it's down 10% or 20% or whatever it is, it's a bit atypical for it to be down on a dollar basis in this third calendar quarter. Is that just because you saw channel refill in June and you're facing a tough comp next?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Bob. I'll go ahead and take that. Number one, your 50% is a little bit high, so let's just start with that. And yes, we are taking a very cautious outlook, but it is not going to be down quarter-over-quarter.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, won't be down. Okay. Okay, then lastly on your big Korean customer, it hasn't been a great story for you, I think maybe misaligned on some architecture so far. But you should have some pretty good visibility in terms of what's going to start to ship next year. Should we begin to expect some more sizeable content gains there for 2019 and 2020 and if you can help us size that? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. This is Eric. Yeah, I think exactly as you said, it's how we see, we had a misalignment in our product portfolio with the direction they were heading a couple of years ago. We remain on track with the expectations we said previously. We'll begin to see a turn on our share this fall and then next spring a significant step up we believe in terms of our share, and then alignment from here as far as we can see maintains very, very good.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I want to thank everyone for attending tonight's call. We hope to see many of you at our upcoming investor presentations and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations of Qorvo. Please go ahead. ","Douglas DeLieto","Thanks very much. Hello everybody and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today\u2019s release and on today\u2019s call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses, or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today, available on our website at qorvo.com, under Investors.","Sitting with me today are; Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; James Klein, President of Qorvo\u2019s Infrastructure and Defense Products Group; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo\u2019s Mobile Products Group; as well as other members of Qorvo\u2019s management team.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks Doug and thank you everyone for joining us. Qorvo delivered another outstanding quarter as our technology investments, portfolio management and operational discipline continue to yield strong and consistent results. Upside during the quarter was attributable to new product cycles across our largest customers.","In Mobile products, the trend toward integration is driving our industry and integration is all the more important with the interaction of 5G. Qorvo is securing significant content in 5G smartphones with our premium technologies and are highly integrated modules, enabling our customers to enhance system performance, overcome design challenges and bring their smartphones to market faster than ever.","In IDP, our markets are supported by secular trends including the deployment of 5G, as well as the proliferation of IoT, the adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and the performance advantages of GaN technology in defense, broadband and massive MIMO base station applications.","Looking at our September quarter by business, our performance in Mobile Products was driven by multiple customers and product segments. Samsung was a standout, as we expanded our participation in their mass market phones. Qorvo's broad portfolio of enabling technology coupled with a robust supply chain and solid product execution is allowing us to solve our customers most challenging problems across all tiers of their portfolio.","To that end, we're enjoying significant traction with our four largest customers in China, designing our low, mid-high and ultrahigh band solutions into their upcoming 5G smartphones. Our wins are broad-based and our solutions are mated with all the major chipset providers including SLSI, Qualcomm, MediaTek and HiSilicon. In Mobile Wi-Fi applications, we are ramping our recently launched Wi-Fi 6 FEMs in support of multiple leading China-based smartphone OEMs.","Turning to IDP, in our defense business, we are lead participant in a U.S. government program to advance state-of-the-art an RF integration packaging and test. We are also increasing our GaN opportunities with the U.S. branch and we secured wins for our GaN amplifiers and integrated front-end modules for X-band and Ka-band defense radar and communications programs. In Infrastructure, the ramp of 5G appears to be rolling out faster than the ramp of 4G. Activity is primarily in the sub-6 gigahertz frequencies and Qorvo's GaN technology is increasingly the technology of choice.","During the quarter, we secured new GaN design wins for sub-6 gigahertz massive MIMO deployments expected to span multiple years. Among China-based carriers, it's been widely published that China Unicom and China Telecom will share cell sites to accelerate 5G deployments. This development will drive the need for broader band and higher power amplifiers favoring Qorvo's GaN solutions. GaN enables operators to drive more power through smaller form factors and achieve better performance at higher frequencies.","In IoT, the ratification of Wi-Fi 6 is a catalyst for the industry and design wins for Qorvo's Wi-Fi 6 solutions are building. During the quarter, we launched the world's first Wi-Fi 6 dual-band front-end module and the world's first Wi-Fi 6 iFEM for CPE applications, expanding our product portfolio for retail, enterprise and network operators. In automotive, we commence production shipments of our Wi-Fi FEM supporting multiple automotive OEM platforms. And notably, our V2X coexistence BAW filters for 5.9 gigahertz were recently selected by a top automotive OEM for models shipping next calendar year.","With the continued expansion of IoT devices and smartphone control, Qorvo is uniquely positioned to combine Wi-Fi 6 iFEMs with advanced filtering and multiprotocol SoCs into highly integrated solutions, reducing time to market and supporting smaller end devices. We expect many of today's gateway devices and voice assistance products to incorporate all of these technologies, enabling in-room control of the entire smart home. In programmable power management, Qorvo is at the forefront of multiple trends, including the trend towards brushless D.C. motors. During the quarter, we expanded our portfolio of integrated motor control solutions for brushless motor applications.","Our power management solutions enable smaller, lighter devices that charge faster and operate longer with between charges. On the design front, programmability enables our customers for lower product development costs and reduced time-to-market. We expect to leverage our scale to drive growth in power tools, light goods, industrial equipment and other product categories. Finally, after the quarter closed, we completed the acquisition of Cavendish Kinetics expanding our technical leadership in switching and tuning. We intend to optimize and scale our RF MEMS technology for smartphones and ultimately apply to other growth segments.","In summary, Qorvo is combining best-in-class products and technologies with operational excellence to drive solid sustainable results. We're encouraged by customer design activity and we expect the strong December quarter as we support our customers next-generation product cycles.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide additional color on the September quarter and our outlook for the December quarter.","Mark Murphy","Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the second quarter was $807 million, $52 million above the midpoint of our guidance and driven by stronger than expected mobile demand.","Mobile revenue of $623 million exceeded expectations that our largest customers and demand strengthening through the quarter. IDP revenue of $184 million was down sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to the effects of export restrictions.","As mentioned last quarter, we expect IDP revenue recover through the year on increasing defense volumes, the ramp of Wi-Fi 6, and broader 5G infrastructure customer demand. Qorvo's shipments to Huawei in the September quarter exceeded expectations and sales at Huawei ended the quarter at approximately 5% of sales.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the September quarter is 46.5% at the end of our guidance range with better than expected manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $167 million in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income in the September quarter was $181 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.52, $0.22 over the midpoint of our guidance.","September quarter cash flow from operations was $173 million and CapEx was $38 million, yielding free cash flow of $135 million. Qorvo's first half fiscal 2020 free cash flow of $342 million is on record pace. And we expect to maintain strong free cash flow through the fiscal year.","We repurchased a $165 million of stock in the quarter and our net leverage at quarter end stood at 0.4 net debt to EBITDA. After quarter end, we issued $350 million of 10-year unsecured notes to opportunistically lower our long-term cost of capital.","Following the quarter, we also completed the purchase of the remaining equity in Cavendish Kinetics, an RF MEMS company for $203 million, further strengthening our technology portfolio for switches, tuners, and other product applications.","Turning to our outlook, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue between $840 million and $860 million or $850 million at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.67 at the midpoint of our guidance.","Our revenue outlook for the December quarter reflects continued robust mobile demand supported by an increase in 5G handset volumes and a return to sequential growth for IDP. For Mobile, we expect December quarter sales to increase sequentially and return to growth year-over-year as 5G handset launches with our integrated solutions and a healthy channel support strong demand.","For IDP, we project December quarter sales to increase on a higher defense business volumes to Wi-Fi 6 ramp and broader 5G infrastructure customer demand. While Qorvo's current near term outlook is strong and channels are healthy, trade and other factors contributed challenges and uncertainty forecast in the outlook.","On gross margin, our December quarter guide were approximately 48%, it is up 150 basis points sequentially on improved mix and lower inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the back half of the fiscal year to between $175 million and $180 million per quarter due to operating costs of recent acquisitions and increased product investment costs related to growth in 5G.","Following our recent debt issue, interest expense will increase sequentially approximately $4 million. We expect the December quarter and fiscal 2020 non-GAAP tax rate to be 8.2% or lower. On capital expenditures, we continue to project spend of less than $200 million this fiscal year and remain highly disciplined on adding capacity. Spend remains weighted towards improving our BAW and GaN capabilities.","As of September quarter results and our December outlook show, Qorvo is operating well as 5G, Wi-Fi, defense and other markets strengthen. As a result of our market outlook, operating performance, free cash flow forecast and other factors Qorvo's Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.","With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.","Karl Ackerman","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess, two if I may. First on Huawei, I guess what's implied in your outlook for December? I guess do you think it's more appropriate to exclude revenue associated with infinity or how should we think about Huawei? And I have a follow-up. ","Mark Murphy","Karl, this is Mark. So Huawei is somewhat consistent with what we had given guidance on the last call. So on $52 million variance we had in second quarter to our guidance roughly a fifth or $10 million of it was related to Huawei. So Huawei was rather than what we thought would probably be 3% or 4% of sales ended up being closer to 5% of sales.","As far as third quarter, we typically don't breakdown guide by customer, but on Huawei what we said last quarters we expect that Huawei to be less than 5% per quarter going forward and we expect at this point for Huawei to run about, what it ran in the second quarter, so close to 5%.","We expect the second half to have Huawei at less than 5% of sales or around 5%. For the full year, we still project Huawei to be less than 10% of sales compared to 15% of last year.","Karl Ackerman","That's helpful. I appreciate that Mark. Shifting gears to China handsets. May you provide a bit more clarity on your opportunity to sell mid and high band PAD to China's handset OEMs? I guess are these contracts set in place today?","We heard from the Korean smartphone manufacturer last night discussing the strength in China handsets some of those OEMs procuring more memory not only ahead of China's tariffs, but also due to strong demand. Are you obviously levered well to the China handset OEMs, but do you think the strength will prove to be favorable due to trade or are there other factors we should consider? Thank you.","Eric Creviston","This is Eric I'll address that. We have seen a significant increase in design activity on 5G with our Chinese customers. And we're not seeing a particular increase in overall units planned for the December quarter or March or going forward, but they are aggressively shifting the portfolio from 4G to 5G. The vast majority of R&D resources are being put on 5G phones right now.","And when you go to the 5G phones in China, across the board, they're going to fully integrated 4G solutions to support that. So, you get increased RF content due to the higher levels of integration and taking 4G to LTE Advanced Pro and in addition you get the additional content from of course the new 5G bands and even higher than we had expected requirements for multicarrier operation and so forth to support non-standalone operation.","So, put all that together and even on flattish units, you can see how the RF content can increase. In Qorvo, in particular, we're really pleased with our position there; leading customer to the customer base and clearly, when it comes to the integrated solutions, mid-high band, in particular, we're getting the vast loin share of that business.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Yeah, hey guys. Congratulations on very strong results. I guess today being Halloween, thanks for making it fun and not terrifying. Hey guys on a serious note both your results in guide are significantly -- very significantly better than The Street. And we just wanted to kind of understand where is the outperformance coming from. Are you -- do you think you're taking share in the new models of 5G? Is it mostly China 5G that you're taking share in or is the tide rising for everybody and you're benefiting with it? Or is there something going on perhaps in the U.S. market, just some color would be appreciated and I've got a follow-up.","Bob Bruggeworth","Harsh thanks for your commitments. I appreciate that. As I said in my opening comments, for the September quarter, it was really driven by three largest customers. So, as you know our three largest customers are in three different continents, so we'll just leave it at that.","And as we look forward in the guidance and I think Eric's answer to Karl's question about what's going on in China in 5G is where -- I think it's two steps. One is the dollar content for 5G phones is significantly increased over 4G phones and then also as we've talked over the last couple of calls that we felt integration was key and being able to integrate the components that are needed for 5G phones. We do believe we're taking some share there from discreet players. So, that's really what's going on. You're seeing the integration coming together in the 4G portion of a 5G phone, plus for 5G and that's what's really driving. It's the dollars per handset.","And then second -- the second area is we are seeing great growth at Samsung. In my opening comments, I talked about expanding into their mass tier phones as well. And we're driving a lot of business there and that's going to be up very nicely year-over-year as well.","Harsh Kumar","Thanks, guys. And then, for my follow-up, within spitting distance of your higher gross margin that you put up in December 2018, 49.5 I think was the number. How do we think about gross margin? I think, your commentary suggest gross margins will be up from here.","And also, what's interesting is, when you went from call it $775 million in June to $807 million in September, your margins didn't go up that much, but when you go from September to December, they're jumping up quite a bit. Is that just integration and the new 5G products kicking in? Or is there something else also going on?","Mark Murphy","Yeah. So, Harsh, this is Mark. I'll provide a few different answers on this question around. First, the quarter sequential up \u2013 second to third quarter up 150 basis points. Two things driving that. One, we have around $10 million worth of inventory charges, what I'll call, excess inventory charges in the second quarter. Three primary drivers, one, we had some excess parts on older generation handset products. Two, we had a very isolated quality issue in the non-core market. And then, three, we were unable to repurpose a portion of a customer-specific product. So, as our practice, we took those charges and they're in our non-GAAP results.","Second, third quarter, we're up 150 basis points. One is -- a major driver there is the inventory charge not repeating. And then secondly, we have a more favorable product mix, second to third quarter. Third to fourth quarter, I'll take this opportunity to address \u2013 we'll see what we typically see third to fourth quarter and that is, we'll see gross margin decrease third to fourth quarter down 100 basis points or more. Again, as we've seen in previous years and this is really a function of seasonal mix. And then, just the effects of fixed manufacturing costs on lower revenues.","Harsh Kumar","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Harsh. ","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava","Thank you. Mark, may we'll just continue the line of questioning with you. So based on the comments and what you've done in December, would March be a worse than seasonal quarter, or you expect March to be seasonal? And then, I had a follow-up please.","Mark Murphy","So, Ambrish, I assume you're talking about the top line or\u2026","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes. Sorry, top line.","Mark Murphy","Yeah.","Ambrish Srivastava","Because you addressed the gross margin.","Mark Murphy","Yeah. So, it is a -- the year outlook has certainly improved for us from our over a quarter ago and I think you see reflected, of course, in the September and results in December guide. The handset replacement cycle seems to stabilize. There is a clear picture in China and we got increasing 5G demand. We've got Wi-Fi 6 adoption starting. Our defense business is doing well. We've got growth in various IoT markets. There's great pull on our technologies, as you heard Eric talk about. And lastly, this important point the channels are healthy.","So we feel good about the December guide. But it's confidence, we aren't in December yet, there are some challenges and uncertainty as we go further out, right? And so we're taking a very disciplined view on expanding the business. The rate and pace of 5G adoption will modulate China trade, we have to admit, remains a source of concern and if there are supply constraints around that situation could that bleed over into our customer demand. So, right now, as we see it, we see second half revenue being roughly in line to down slightly versus what we did in the first half. And since you've got the December guide using that midpoint, that would be a March seasonal decline of around 15% sequentially.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. That's very helpful. Yes, sorry, go ahead.","Mark Murphy","And then while I am at it, I talked about gross margin gets down 100 basis points or more, which is typical for our business to have a sequential decline. I've mentioned higher OpEx in the second half in my comments and the higher interest expense. Because it\u2019s the segment level, I won't go into much detail here but mobile will be up sequentially in the third quarter and returned to growth year-over-year, it'll be down the fourth quarter seasonally sequentially and then up double-digits year-over-year. And then on IDP, we'll see very strong growth sequentially in third quarter, again Wi-Fi, defense, broader infrastructure demand, expected to strengthen through the year and then we're hoping to see year-over-year growth return on IDP but that's tougher part.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. I was going to say thanks for the transparency that's a lot more, but really appreciate it as always. Quick one, since you've been on Board, Mark, you've been very focused on free cash flow. And I just wanted to tie that buy back as well. So is there a target that you are willing to give for the year for free cash flow and then the share buyback, is there a timing on that, please? Thank you.","Mark Murphy","Yes. There is no timing on the buyback. And as far as just -- I'll make some comments historically over the past 12 months, we've generated over $755 million of free cash flow. And over that time, we've repurchased $716 million, so well over 90% of our free cash flow we have repurchased shares. Over this time, we've also deployed over $500 million with the purchases of two companies. So we're certainly -- we're generating more free cash flow than we had been and we're doing a good job of smartly investing in organically and then returning sizable amounts to shareholders.","On the capital return, at this point, given the market outlook, our operating performance, free cash flow forecast, other factors, we were out of capacity -- we didn't have much capacity left, so the Board approved a new billion-dollar program and I'm just not going to comment a rate and pace at this point other than to say, we'll continue to buyback shares.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, that\u2019s good enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Toshiya Hari","Hi, guys thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on the very strong results. Mark, you talked about your mobile business returning to year-over-year growth in the quarter. And this is, obviously, in the phase of overall smartphone unit\u2019s been down, Huawei obviously becoming significantly smaller customer on a year-over-year basis. And you guys, I think losing a fairly sizable stock at a big customer.","So, I guess the question is what's driving the year-over-year growth? Is it all 5G? Is it -- you guys having better presence at Samsung and some of those mainstream cues? Is it something else? If you can talk about some of the drivers on a year-over-year basis for the quarter that would be great. Then I have a follow-up.","Mark Murphy","I mean, it's broad customer engagement. China and 5G helps, but I don't really think it's a technology story for us and I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Creviston","Yeah. We've got as you know a very broad portfolio, just a growing list of opportunities across all of our customers, including our largest customer as well. From the main path integrated transmit modules and so forth for both low band and mid-high band and evermore increasing ultrahigh band activity, but also around tuning in around the antenna elements, a lot more signals trying to come and go from those two antenna elements. And so I think that's just an opportunity, it\u2019 applies across the board.","But really as we said a standout really has to be Samsung, I think we've traditionally been a very strong supply there. We got out of line or got of out of alignment with the product roadmap and their architecture for a cycle or two, but we're fully back in alignment across, not only the flagship or marquee tier, but also the mass tier of handsets there and just real pleased with the alignment we have and enjoying building that business back again.","Toshiya Hari","Great. And then on gross margins, Mark you guys have done a great job over the past several quarters, executing to margins. Can you remind us what some of the initiatives are in place today that hopefully gets you to 50% over the medium-term? And if you can kind of provide a bridge to 50%, whatever the timeline is that would be great. And then shorter related to that, can you give us an update on what your thoughts are on Farmers Branch from the timing perspective and how that could potentially impact CapEx? Thank you.","Mark Murphy","Yeah. So Toshiya we're, obviously, still working to achieve 50% or more. We believe it's an achievable target. And as I think Harsh mentioned, I'll remind you that we're at 49.5% about this time last year. And as far as -- I won't do a specific walk as there's just too many variables, but starting with our December guide as a baseline at 48%, we would expect volume growth for many of the reasons that Eric mentioned and James can talk about, we expect volume growth. And so we'd expect to see better utilization. I mean this year, the volumes had certainly been lower than we had originally anticipated and then the mix has sort of weighed on our in-house capacity.","Next calendar year, we're also having a consolidation of our fabs, largely complete and most notably Florida will be closed and those products rolled into Greensboro, so those cost effects will subside. Also over time, we would expect the mix at IDP to improve and be a larger part of Qorvo, certainly compared to December quarter guide this 48% baseline that I talked about.","And then we're doing a lot of product portfolio management as well. So that'll improve that mix and that's the purpose of our select and high-tech investments.","Finally, we are operating, I'd say as well as we ever have and that's allowing us to drive I would say better productivity than we were even before and to the extent we're doing above inflation price erosion that would be incremental benefit to gross margin.","As far as farmers branch, our current view given the outlook and efficiency gains that we've seen in Richardson, we won't need farmers branch at scale until late next calendar year or even the following year.","As we've mentioned previously and I think James and I mentioned this when we were in New York in September, due to these gains and the flexibility we have at Richardson and that's a great fab. It's allowed us to revisit our original manufacturing concept in Texas. And we've gone from what was going to be a copy exact idea of the farmers' branch do more of a single fab concept for the whole Dallas area. And yes, that allows us to be capital and cost-efficient and it positions us well for the long-term.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you for the details and congrats again.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Bill Peterson","Yes, hey guys and thanks for letting me ask a question and nice job on the results and guidance. My first question is in mobile. And I guess I was hoping that Eric can sort of level set us. You've talked about an RF TAM increasing next year by about $1 billion. It sounds like some of the 5G opportunities are coming in may be a little bit sooner than expected as you talk about the December. But I'm trying to give a feel for how you think the RF TAM should grow in the next year in the shape of the ramp. Our assumption is that it will be somewhat second half weighted, but -- and then within that, how should we think about your business, especially how it relates to the design wins you've had, you talked about the four large China makers, if you can help level set the market context as well as the shape of your business in 5G? Thank you.","Eric Creviston","Sure. Thanks Bill. Yes, we've been saying since our Analyst Day in 2018, we expected about $1 billion increase in the RF TAM in calendar 2020 due to 5G ramping. And it certainly looking like it's going to be conservatively greater than that much closer to $2 billion probably and it's equally weighted from at least our view currently between more units than we had originally expected and more content per unit. So we got both factors affecting it pretty significantly.","And the higher units are really driven by this really rapid adoption and switchover of the handsets in China. It's clear from what we're seeing there that the 4G handsets that are going to be released are going to be dropping significantly in the very near-term.","Whether there's coverage or not, consumers are going to be buying 5G handsets knowing that the network will be available at some time during that time they own that phone. So, they're getting a real jump on it.","Obviously, Samsung as well as transitioning their portfolio rapidly to include 5G content. So, that increases the number of 5G handsets well above the $200 million or so that we had originally modeled a couple of years ago. But then in addition to that, as I said, it looks like across the Board all the 5G handsets so far without any -- going the other way. They're all going to fully integrated 4G systems inside them. And part of that is just to get the size. I mean these are really cramming also a lot of functionality into these handsets, so there may be integration for that, but it also get some market faster and improves performance.","So that integration trend all the base content with 4G also has content and the last adder is the requirements from China Mobile and so forth for band coverage. And so having N79 in every phone for example, the requirements for dual signaling and so forth, these are now being put in every single 5G handsets. So all that's coming together to increase the total TAM and see why tuning well above we had not previously. ","Bill Peterson","Okay. And thanks for that and -- moving to James businesses, it is obviously seeing really rapid growth that's accelerated here in the last few quarters including the guide. I mean you talked over the potential return to year-over-year growth. But I guess with Huawei significantly lower -- did you have an of sort of -- you mentioned you're prodding out your wireless infrastructure coverage customers, but how should we think the growth of that business as we look in the next year with March maybe returning the growth. And then progressing to the next year given that we have Wi-Fi 6 defense and then additional customers for the infrastructure? ","James Klein","Bill, this is James. Thanks for the question. And the restrictions of Huawei have definitely limited our ability to grow in the near-term. However as Mark say, we hope to return to year-over-year growth in Q4. We're going to take a good step in that direction in Q3 with double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth.","Longer-term, we remain really positive about the underlying trends and the markets we serve and that includes the adoption of massive MIMO and 5G the adoption of GaN and several different markets, and the Wi-Fi 6 coming on and IoT in both automotive and in the connected home.","And that the addition of power management is also improved our long-term outlook. In fact that business grew quarter-over-quarter about 40% and is very much on pace to how we looked at prior the acquisition. So with all that combined my expectation is that we will return back into double-digit growth mode as we get down into out years.","Bill Peterson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for the question. Your next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. Good evening. First question is that, there's been some lingering concerns since the trade restrictions were put in place that the Chinese OEMs and Huawei in particular would backslide into discrete RF solutions either because they couldn't get access to U.S. components or because they were worried that there wouldn't be able to in the future?","Your results don't seem to point that direction, but can you address that concern? And if you can also address, if it's feasible without highly integrated components? Do you think that even in they chose to do that, it would be possible to do a 5G phone even for domestic Sub-6 in China without these highly integrated components?","Eric Creviston","This is Eric. We have seen of course customers experimenting with full discrete solutions and even trying to go as far as to build a handsets without any U.S. connector content for example. Those experiments are out there. You'll see them in the field. I think that experiment was enough to really fully validate the fact that you can't make it competitive handset without using U.S. content. And further really you can't build a compelling handset without going to integration because the solution size is so large and power-hungry and poor performing that it really degrades the selling factor for the handset. So experiments happen, it confirms the thesis and generally people are returning to integration in full force.","Chris Caso","Well, thank you. As a follow-up to that, perhaps if you could clarify the restrictions on what you can and can't ship to Huawei both in the handset and the base station side, is it only the restriction only on 5G, does it apply to 4G also? And actually one of the experiments you refer to that we've seen did use fully integrated 4G without discreet 5G solutions, so perhaps is that suggestive of you can't ship the 5G solution?","Bob Bruggeworth","Chris, this is Bob. And I think we addressed this in the last call as best we could. And I wish I could get into a lot of details. It's quite complicated. We spent a lot of time making sure that we comply with all of the legal requirements that we can't ship to Huawei given the export restrictions. The restrictions are such that we are able to ship components that go into their phones. We have shipped components that go into their infrastructure side, but I don't think I can get into really serious discussion without a lot of help and understanding from a lot of people on what is good and what is bad to ship. I think the important thing is, we are able to ship to them. We are fully in compliance with the export restrictions that are required to support them.","Chris Caso","All right. Got it. Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Hettenbach","Great. Thanks. In the IDP business, I know you've talked a lot about kind of aerospace defense and then infrastructure. Can you touch on just kind of the broader based IoT business, kind of the scope of that business today and opportunities that you're seeing?","James Klein","Yes. This is James. So the market in general is still maturing. Several different standards have been competing Wi-Fi, ZigBee, BOE, Thread and NB IoT. We're positioned pretty well across all of those different aspects of the market. Our strategy is effectively been to title supply in the connected home and in the automotive space. Our automotive business although is small, is growing at a very nice clip and in fact, grew well into the double-digit range year-over-year in this current quarter.","Wi-Fi has been a bit weak over the last couple of quarters as we have reported, but we are showing signs of recovery. The Wi-Fi 6 standard release in October and it's fueled our second quarter in a row, a very strong design wins and we think that's a great sign that that business will return back into growth mode fairly soon.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks. And just a follow-up question for Mark. Appreciate the color on just some of the OpEx, with the RF MEMS acquisition. Can you share just from a revenue perspective, how that settles out?","Mark Murphy","Yes. So I'll give an update Craig on both -- so both our acquisitions. So on the recent RF MEMS business, that's not financially accretive in fiscal 2020 and that's reflected in our guide. So it's an increase in OpEx and there's no income accretion there.","On the Programmable Power Management business, I think it was last call, I said, the $50 million of revenue in our fiscal 2020 and slightly accretive. As James mentioned, that's very much on track. It's delivered on expectations in the September quarter and our guide reflects the previous guidance I gave around that business.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Ed Snyder","Thanks a lot. Eric, you talk a lot about the move to -- rapid move to Phase 6 in China now. I know the experimental last year isn\u2019t high-end enough. Sounds like they're going in mass toward 5G, which I guess is to be very expected. But that poses a problem here, because if the handset volumes are growing in mass to this and you have to buy these modules from [Indiscernible] or yourself. How does that work with Huawei? I mean, if -- are these components not covered by the band? Is Huawei being left out of this shift? Or this is on the substitute for these products?","And then, James, if I could, you're guiding up next quarter, led by defense, and you call out GaN and X Band expand. Are you looking at production now with some of these larger systems like Spy 60 [ph] or Gator [ph] or is it more development work? And if it's a former, can you give some kind of color on the run? I know this stuff has been in development for many years now, but some of these are very large systems with bit unit volumes in the long-term. Just trying to get a feel for how defense will play out over the next long-term, actually, next 12 months or so. And then I have a follow-up.","Eric Creviston","So to your first question about Huawei and highly integrated modules, while staying completely consistent with export regulations, we're able to ship the highly integrated modules across all frequency bands to Huawei's handset division. And Jim will take second part.","James Klein","Yeah. Ed, for defense, so the defense business has been solid growth engine for us. I think it really going to have a nice back half and fuel the recovery, you talked about earlier. GaN related -- there are numerous production programs for GaN. We announced one this quarter that was the arrangement with Lockheed Martin on Q-53 and again you can read what that system is. But there are numerous other production programs using our GaN capability.","Ed Snyder","Okay. And then, Eric, looking back, you talked about ultra-high band wins, which we, kind of, see dabbling about last year, so I know it's showing up here. But then also you talked about higher content 5G then you'd expected. Is there something being added to the 5G section or you're talking more of the halo effect of 5G on 4G, for example, in the tuners antenna plexus, that sort of things? So I'm just getting my arms around, given the faults you're seeing on the bands and the tear downs, what additional -- actually pure 5G content could you be talking about when you say that 5G content is higher than anticipated? Thanks.","Eric Creviston","Yeah. Great question, Ed. The halo affect with 4G was largely contemplated. I think that's on track for the most part. Additional tuning is definitely higher than we had expected. But I think the primary new content in 5G proper are brands like, as I mentioned, as an example, in 79 being acquired across all China handsets, not just China Mobile, for example. The requirements with the dual signaling for non-stand-alone operations so you have to be build a transmitter on 4G and 5G at the same time. Once that was fully incorporated into the architectures, it turned out to take more switching more complex RF than was expected. And by the way we don't see any of this going to away. Even if China immediately went into standalone 5G, all the architectures we're seeing are going to keep that dual signaling mode. They'll use that 4G carrier to transmitter even more data on. So, we don't think that this is just sort of a onetime blip in content. It's going to continue to ratchet up from here going forward.","Edward Snyder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. Mark I guess my first question can you give us a sense of your largest customer how big they were maybe in the quarter? And maybe not -- if you don't want to give us numbers, can you talk about like year-over-year how much they grew or didn't grow? Thank you.","Mark Murphy","No, Tim we had one 10% customer in the quarter and I can't give details about that specific customer's growth.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Awesome. And then do you have any sense maybe James about if you have any forecast that you're sort of thinking about for the global 5G handsets builds for mostly obviously sub-six next year? The numbers are all over the map, there is somewhere at 175 and some people talk about 300. Can you help us think about what sort of a global TAM will be so we can think about how big things could actually be a for next year in a 5G? Thank you.","Mark Murphy","I'll speak to the handset side and then let James chime in on the infrastructure side. I mentioned earlier we had baselined around a $1 billion in the TAM for the calendar year 2020 and that was roughly $200 million handsets at $5. So, we're projecting that back in 2018 even or earlier.","And so what we're seeing now is maybe not quite $300 million, but approaching $300 million in terms of units likely. And the content being a little above $5 as well -- probably $6 or $7 worth of additional content. So, that's -- we're as we said much closer to $2 billion now based on customer forecast to us and the architectures we see ramping next year.","James Klein","On the base station said, we see about $1 billion of TAM being added and it's all associated with 5G add-ons. And most of that is attributed to the adoption of massive MIMO.","We expect over the next several years of somewhere in the range of 30% of the base station deployed will use massive MIMO technology. And as I've talked about before that's about 10x content gain for us in each one of those base stations.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome. Thank you so much.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Raji Gill","Yes, thank you. And I echo my congratulations. You mentioned in terms of the portfolio of the Chinese handset customers moving to 5G from 4G. But I've fairly seen a -- I guess a jump in the actual units rather the RF contents going up.","To the earlier question about the TAM, I'm just wondering if this -- the replacement cycle that you're expecting to see in 5G will actually also result in higher incremental units with the overall Chinese handset market? And how do we think about that? When do we expect maybe like unit growth to start to kind of increase as a result of the transition to 5G?","Eric Creviston","So, we're not modeling an increase in unit growth going forward. We did see replacement cycles moving out that was part of a bit of a drag over the last year. They're stabilized now for the time being at least. We are modeling them necessarily kicking back. If units go up that means replacement cycles have got to be shortening and we're not modeling that over all.","Raji Gill","So this is just primarily going to be driven by purely RF content gains to support 4G but also the new bands?","Eric Creviston","Yeah, that's right exactly. So the total number of handsets more than being 5G versus 4G without more units and then 5G hasn\u2019t going to come through.","Raji Gill","Okay. And then for my follow-up question. I guess, it is to the earlier question about the risk of Huawei and other Chinese handset OEMs using non-U.S. filter company. You\u2019d mentioned that there is some experiments out there, but the results are that there's a push back to an integrated solution. Knowing the fact that these RF designs are pretty much have already been locked in for the phones next year, if you look at it 2021, is there potential risk that these OEMs will move to more of a same architecture ID without integrated power amplifier versus TAM ID architecture?","Bob Bruggeworth","Number one, I want to make sure we understand that in China, let's understand the export phones as well. So for anything they're exporting, they're going to compete with obviously Samsung and others, so they're going to make sure we buy the best RF. And as you all know, the RF does influence dropped calls, battery life, things that we as consumers recognized and judge phones by. So that's important distinction.","Second, even in China they're building their brands and want to make sure that they can compete with Huawei, and so far we have not seen any one that is willing to sacrifice, if they have the ability to buy from U.S. suppliers to sacrifice performance and tarnish their brand.","The other thing I just want to caution you on is that there are many phone designs that are still left to be done in the second half of this year and their direction at least in the architectures we're seeing are still with the integrated products that we've been talking about.","Raji Gill","Very good. Thank you for the insight.","Operator","Thank you for the question. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call over to management for any further or closing comments.","Douglas DeLieto","Thank you. We want to thank you everyone for joining us on tonight's call. We help to see you at upcoming investor meetings and we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our third quarter results. Thanks again and hope you have a good night.","Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's events. You may now disconnect your lines."],"18607":["Qorvo, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much, Chelsea. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today, available on our website, qorvo.com, under Investors.","In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up. Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group; as well as other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone. The Qorvo team delivered a strong March quarter, with revenue and EPS above the midpoint of our range and record quarterly free cash flow of $227 million. The company is continuing to make broad strides operationally with strong commercial traction across products and customers. I'm especially pleased with the success we are achieving on BAW-based products, which we expect will lift factory utilization in the September quarter and beyond.","For the 2018 fiscal year, IDP expanded margins and achieved outstanding revenue growth, up over 20%, while Mobile Products expanded margins and built a solid foundation for profitable growth. Looking forward, Qorvo is better positioned today to target and win our markets' highest growth and most complex opportunities, which in turn will drive us towards our target operating model.","During the March quarter, the handset environment improved in China. We are seeing increased demand in the performance-tier for RF Flex and RF Fusion based solutions as well as for antenna tuning, discrete components and BAW-based multiplexers.","Take for example our wins in Phase 6 architectures that include Qorvo's SAW and BAW technologies. Our Phase 6 RF Fusion solutions include both the mid\/high-band and low-band modules, which provide complete front end coverage in two placements. In many cases, we're adding to our Phase 6 design wins with additional high value content, including our industry leading envelope tracking and antenna control solutions.","Despite constraints in frequency spectrum, Mobile operators are mandating improved data throughput and more RF functionality in the same footprint in Mobile devices. To meet these demands, customers are requiring more highly integrated architectures with complex, more functionally dense RF content. These factors favor our device technologies, design capabilities and manufacturing scale, which enable us to drive content gains.","At Qorvo, we're addressing the most complex customer requirement in the RF segments which are forecasted to grow the fastest, including ultra-high band placements, integrated mid and high band placements, antenna plexers, antenna tuning and diversity receive modules. We're investing in the highest growth segments and winning across products and customers.","We're forecasting significant growth in BAW-based products across customers and our BAW factory utilization looks strong as we move into fiscal 2019. Weighing onto this, we will roll out die shrinks and wafer conversions to help manage the need for additional capital expenditures to meet increases in BAW demand. We continue to expect BAW-based products will represent around half of Mobile Products' revenue by fiscal year 2021.","In IDP, March quarterly revenue was another record, up 26% year-over-year to $212 million. We successfully repositioned our product portfolio more than two years ago and we continue to be pleased with the results. IDP competes in diversified growth markets. We partner with the best in the business and we win with differentiated products and technologies.","In defense, year-over-year revenue \u2013 year-over-year growth was led by strength in ongoing production programs and the continued adoption of GaN for high-power applications. In IoT, we continue to advance our Pod in Every Room vision with multiple 2.4 gigahertz, 5 gigahertz and BAW filter design wins with leading meshed Wi-Fi networking system providers. We also achieved record revenue in low-power wireless, led by our production ramp of our multi-protocol SoC for Samsung's remote controls.","In infrastructure, the timeline for 5G deployment has accelerated and Qorvo is in close collaboration with customers by participating in dozens of 5G field trials and demos. During the quarter, we extended our 5G market leadership by adding the industry's first 28 gigahertz GaN on silicon carbide front end module for base stations. This follows on the footsteps of the industry's first 39 gigahertz front end module which we released last year.","We also released the industry's first BAW filter to deliver a quadrupling in power handling capabilities for 5G massive-MIMO front end modules. 5G is coming across networks and Mobile devices and it's accelerating the requirements for gigabit LTE which will serve as the backbone for 5G.","Gigabit LTE requires best in class, highly integrated placements and Qorvo is targeting the most complex and most valuable solutions, especially those that require BAW-based content. In both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo's addressing our customers' most critical challenge as the complexity of their products continues to increase. This favors superior performance as a differentiator and increases the value of enabling technologies like BAW and GaN.","As we continue on our lean journey and become more efficient through operational excellence, we expect to grow the business with greater capital efficiency, by shrinking die sizes, expanding wafer diameters and leveraging our foundry relationships.","In summary, Qorvo's solutions are enabling customers to achieve higher levels of performance and helping to transform the end user experience. We're targeting our markets' fastest growing and most profitable opportunities and we're gaining design wins across our customer base. We're poised to benefit from the strong secular trends in gigabit LTE, 5G, IoT and GaN and we believe we're well positioned for revenue growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow in fiscal 2019.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guidance range at $664 million. Mobile revenue of $452 million was higher than expected on improving China demand. IDP revenue was $212 million, the eighth consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year growth. IDP has a diversified and sustainable platform for long-term growth built on solutions for advanced radars and other electronic warfare defense applications, Wi-Fi and connectivity applications and GaAs and GaN products for wireless infrastructure.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was 48%, at the lower end of our guidance range on mix effects across Qorvo and within both business units. Our margin outlook for the full year of fiscal 2019 remains positive as we optimize our product portfolio, grow our top line, improve factory utilization and drive additional operational improvements.","Operating expenses were $156 million, up approximately $5 million sequentially on higher development program spending and seasonal payroll effects. Year-over-year, OpEx was down $8 million from ongoing productivity efforts, including our September quarter restructuring activities. As with gross margins, our outlook on OpEx is on track with our long term model. OpEx will vary within the year on seasonal effects and the timing of development programs, but over time, we expect to continue driving OpEx down as a percent of our revenue.","Operating income for the quarter was $163 million or 24.5% of sales, up 370 basis points versus last year. Non-GAAP net income in the March quarter was $139 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.07, $0.02 over the midpoint of our guidance and up 26% year-over-year. March quarter cash flow from operations remained strong at $259 million and CapEx decreased again sequentially at $32 million, which helped drive a second consecutive record free cash flow quarter of $227 million.","We are committed to executing a model that delivers stronger and more durable free cash flows and our full year fiscal 2018 free cash flow of $583 million was a strong start to demonstrating that commitment. We repurchased $51 million of stock in the quarter and cash at quarter end was $926 million.","Turning to our outlook, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $645 million and $665 million; gross margin to decline sequentially to approximately 44%, reflecting near-term impacts of product mix and costs associated with low SAW fab utilization; and diluted EPS of $0.75 at the mid-point of our guidance.","On revenue, we expect IDP to post another solid quarter of solid year-over-year growth in the June quarter, but decline sequentially due in part to recent U.S. Department of Commerce actions on ZTE. For Mobile, we see sequential and year-over-year revenues up slightly in the June quarter and an improving demand environment in China.","On gross margin, we view the June quarter as a transition period and forecast gross margins to return to more normal levels in the September quarter. The projected June quarter gross margin decline of 4 points is driven by two principal factors: a weaker overall mix of products and costs associated with low fab utilization. Roughly half of the sequential decline in June is associated with an increase of legacy lower-tier and less profitable products in our mix. We expect this to reverse through the year on new product launches and as our mix shifts to higher margin products in both Mobile and IDP.","The other major drag on margins in the June quarter is costs associated with the underutilization of our SAW capacity. While these costs weigh on margins through the year, with low seasonal revenues, they are particularly impactful in the June quarter. We expect this impact to moderate through the year as revenues increase and our product mix shifts.","Going forward, we will continue to work to minimize the burden of our SAW underutilization, while retaining world-class capability to serve our customers. It is worth noting that outside our SAW capacity, our utilization outlook is positive and in line with previous comments.","Despite these near-term impacts, we currently forecast second half fiscal 2019 gross margin to be at least 50%, with full year gross margin of approximately 49%. Operating expenses are forecast to increase in the June quarter to approximately $165 million on higher personnel costs, including increased design activity. We expect OpEx to remain slightly elevated in the first half of the fiscal year and trend down in the second half, totaling less than 20% of sales for the full year.","We remain on track to achieve the operating margin target we laid out at Investor Day last May of 33% by fiscal year 2020. We expect our June quarter and full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10%. With more profitable growth in Mobile and robust growth in IDP, expanding operating margins and sustained low levels of CapEx, we expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million in fiscal year 2019.","So in summary, in the fourth quarter, we posted another quarter above our guidance and delivered strong operating leverage. For fiscal 2019, we expect to transition from a seasonally low June quarter and strengthen considerably in the second half of the year.","For the full year of fiscal 2019, we currently expect our premium Mobile Products and continued strength in defense, IoT and GaN will generate revenue growth of approximately 9% or 10%, support continued margin expansion and drive robust free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","A couple of questions. Bob, seasonality in the handset space has been all over the place for the last few years. I guess there was a lot of fear and concern going into the June quarter. Can I ask you your viewpoint on the Chinese market and also your largest customers and the puts and takes there?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Harsh. I'll take a very high level view on that, like, we don't really enjoy getting into customer mix. As I said in my opening comments, the China market did start to come back, but I also have to acknowledge the team did a really good job on designing in a lot of products. Our customers in China released a lot of new phones.","So I think we're seeing \u2013 we went into the quarter with some pretty healthy being low inventory and that's kind of what the uptake was. So we're kind of seeing that continue this quarter. I think our largest customers already spoke for themselves, so I think you guys know how that's going. So China market's looking okay. We're taking very cautious view on it. We've seen this play out before. We're trying to keep our inventories healthy, meaning light, low.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Fair enough. And one for Mark. Mark, I heard your comments. Is it appropriate to think that the gross margin effects are primarily temporary just that SAW is coming down faster, BAW has maybe not \u2013 is not going to ramp in the June quarter? Would you give us a sense of timing when BAW will ramp? And then also you gave some numbers first half \u2013 you gave full year margin I think of 49%, but you also gave another number 49% and I missed that. Would you just clarify what that was? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. So, Harsh, to your first question, what you are seeing is what you mentioned. We are \u2013 and it's starkest in the June quarter, you're seeing the transition from legacy, less advanced products and more SAW related content to a portfolio that's more BAW related and other advanced technologies and as well as GaN, continued growth in IDP. So you're seeing that transition play out and it will improve our margins both because of the more favorable product mix, but also the favorable utilization effects, of course, with our largest fab.","Also in the June quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we are experiencing the costs of the underutilization in our SAW capacity. And because it's a relatively low revenue quarter for the year, those period costs impact us the greatest. And that effect, while it persists through the year, fiscal year 2019, it goes from about 200 basis points effect in the beginning of the year here down to, it can be as low as under 1% later in the year.","As far as the year margin guidance, we do expect to come off of this 44% gross margin in the June quarter quickly. The September quarter will return to more normal levels, which I would say be 47%, 48%. And then in the back half of the year, as I mentioned in my comments, 50% or more, and that should give you the profile for the year.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe you could just talk about this BAW ramp in terms of your visibility. Obviously, it's harder to manufacture tens of thousands or millions of units. And I know the issues two years ago with the low-band PAD, I'm just kind of curious your visibility and your ability to manufacture these BAWs. And is there anything left on your side that you still need to accomplish before the ramp in the second half?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, good question, Blayne. I think first, that factory has done a fantastic job of supporting all of our customers' ramps over the past years with BAW-based products. So we feel real good about that. So second, to your point, a few years ago, we had a very valuable lesson, that we did, a lot of lessons learned. We started something that we call our clean launch programs for our large customers and key products. And that actually was extremely successful this past year, past fiscal year 2018, as we ramped many products for many customers at extremely high volume. So with that as kind of the background, we're feeling pretty good about the work that's going on in our BAW factory and we don't anticipate any problems with ramping BAW products.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for that. And maybe if I could just ask about the tick up in OpEx, I think last time you had a big tick up, it was due to some projects or some tape outs or such. Why the tick up in June? And maybe if you could just talk about how long that should you think comes down to second half, is it a couple of quarters and then comes back down?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I'll make a high level comment, Blayne. If you really look at it, it's typical that a lot of our design activities are in the beginning of our fiscal year and then tail off at the end of the year. But I'll let Eric go through what drives that.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","No, that's exactly right. The high volume fall flagship launches in particular and maybe getting to the first half of your question to really validate quality and yield and performance, we run a lot of volumes in still the prototype stage to fine tune the process and make sure that we're clean for the launch.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And I would just add that, Blayne, as I mentioned in my comments, OpEx can be seasonal depending on various activities. But we absolutely are committed to this aggressive portfolio management and in part because we very much want to get more efficient with our OpEx and drive that down to below 20% of sales.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Blayne, this is James. Some of the OpEx increase is IDP, obviously, with the growth we've experienced, we are definitely hiring in the R&D area in multiple product areas and we'll continue to do that as we go through the year. So part of that increase is ours.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up question on SAW, and it sounds like what you're talking about is once the revenue ramps that's kind of on the area of 100 basis points headwind to margins. Is there anything else that you can do to eliminate that over time, any way to rationalize that capacity or eliminate that longer term drag on \u2013 of SAW on margins?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, it's a good question, Chris. We've done a number of things already and we've done our best to size our footprint for what we believe we need to serve customer needs and continue to maintain a great capability that we've got. So we've already taken some actions. You will notice in the GAAP results we did impair some assets associated with SAW capacity and you'll see that as a large charge about $38 million, $39 million in the GAAP results.","We will continue to make sure we right-size our asset footprint and maintain the resources \u2013 and balance that with maintaining the resources we need to maintain this capability, because it's important for our product launches, particularly as we see this Phase 6 where you're seeing combined SAW and BAW. So we think we need this capability long-term.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Just as a follow-up to that, in your prepared comments, you talked about greater capital efficiency. Could you expand on that a bit? And I suppose what you just mentioned on SAW is probably part of that, but over time, what effect does that have on free cash flow generation as a percentage of revenue as you take those actions?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, we've had a great story the past year-and-a-half on free cash flow. Our CapEx as a percent of sales couple of years ago peaked at close to 20%. This past fiscal year that we just closed out we were under 10% of sales. And on a dollar basis, we expect 2019 to be at about those levels or less.","That's \u2013 in addition to just improving operating cash flow, this CapEx trend has certainly bolstered free cash flow growth. We were \u2013 in the past three quarters, we've generated $600 million \u2013 over $600 million of free cash flow. In the past two quarters, individually, we've generated more free cash flow than we did in all of fiscal year 2017. So we are absolutely committed to continuing this.","We do believe the capital intensity of the business is something we can continue to drive down and we're doing that in a number of ways, from better forecasting and planning our capital needs to \u2013 we've talked extensively about wafer expansion projects, four to six, six to eight, to die shrink programs which a number of those are still underway, of which BAW die shrink is an important program which you'll hear more about at Investor Day and just as aggressive portfolio management which we're undertaking, which \u2013 we talked about SAW capacity earlier. So I see some runway left in getting our CapEx as a percent of sales down over time. And of course, with revenue growth and expanding margins see the operating cash flow improving.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks so much. I wanted to ask about IDP. Very nice growth acceleration in the quarter. Curious what drove that in Q4. And related to IDP, you talked about ZTE in your guide. If you could quantify that that would be helpful. And I guess Huawei is probably your biggest customer in IDP as well. So if you can provide some thoughts on the risks associated with that account as well that would be helpful? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Toshiya, this is Bob. I'll go ahead and take ZTE. For the company, it's a little bit over $40 million for the year kind of number, so kind of a $10 million run rate, that will size it, the majority of that is IDP. As far as Huawei goes, I'll let James talk about it. It's a big customer, but not anywhere near as biggest, but go ahead, James.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. For Huawei, they are one of our top five customers. And of course, we'll see how that goes. I mean, it's certainly too early for us to call anything. We'll continue to support the customers we have and look forward to seeing how it all works out.","For ZTE, we do see that as a short-term issue. My belief is that either of those issues will be worked out with the U.S. government or the natural demand will shift to the other OEMs. And we're well positioned really across that whole OEM structure. So I see this as working itself out over the next couple of quarters for us and returning back to normal levels.","Growth for the quarter, particularly strong in Wi-Fi, combining our best in class power amps with our BAW coexistence, band-edge filters and the integration capabilities have really allowed us to get a lot of traction in this marketplace. We're focused in the high performance slot both consumer and enterprise. And the recent product releases we have are really laying the foundation for ax allowing for high throughput and thermal efficiency that's going to be needed for that kind of traffic level.","So, great tremendous activity out of our Wi-Fi group. We also grew our low-power wireless business to record revenue and that was a second growth driver. And then defense has been particularly strong really across all major submarkets, radar, EW, comms and reaching a broad set of customers.","As an example, our revenues through the distribution was also very, very strong, demonstrating the broad applicability of our products. We also had strong production programs in defense. I think that added to it as well. And with the recent passing of the defense spending bill, with over 17% increase in spending, we think that gives us a very nice tailwind. So broad based really over three key markets.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, I had a question on BAW. You guys reiterated your fiscal 2021 target 50% of Mobile. I'm curious, what was the number for fiscal 2018? And over the next couple of years, should we expect a relatively linear progression or more of a back half kind of hockey stick inflection in fiscal 2020 and 2021? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. For BAW-enabled revenue, Toshiya, we were under 25% in fiscal year 2018, kind of mid 22%, 23%. In fiscal year 2019, we expect about 30%. And as Bob mentioned, about half the Mobile business in fiscal year 2021 will be BAW enabled.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. I had a question on the China smartphone market. You talked about kind of that market's been leaned out and they're starting to recover, but also looks like perhaps some company-specific strengths. So can you talk about maybe your market share position or where you feel that's kind of shaking out and the implications to your growth in that market?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. This is Eric. I'll take that. Regarding the March quarter beginning to see some strength, we did mention in the call last time that we were being very, very careful with inventory so that when the growth began to come back we would see it immediately. And I think it probably came back a little sooner than we expected.","But in addition to that, with the very tight inventory controls that we have as well as our largest customers, we saw \u2013 we actually grew sequentially in the March quarter as it turned out with China and see a lot of that strength continuing on into this quarter. But, of course, we're being cautious and as always trying to make sure that we maintain that low channel inventory both of our own inventory as well as customer inventory.","In terms of share in the transition, the majority of the market today is still Phase 2 and in Phase 3 components. We see throughout this year a continued transition towards the higher levels of integration and performance going up in three, five phases and we're beginning already to get production orders for our Phase 6 system.","And Phase 6 does an awful lot. It's a big step up, a much higher level of integration, higher band coverage, higher output power capability, MIMO and so forth. And for us, of course, it's also an opportunity, because with all the filters integrated, we can get the lion's share of the value (32:46). So there's a big transition for us this year not only in our marquee smartphones, but also in the performance-tier in China picking up higher content with that integration.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then if I could have a follow-up for Mark just around inventory, the inventory increased, just how are you thinking about that as you go into the back half of the calendar year, and how you might want to manage inventory?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Nothing unusual in inventory, Craig. I mean, we use inventory to maintain loadings in the fabs. And then in the case of SAW, we make sure our cost reduction plans are effectively executed. So nothing unusual about what you're seeing in inventory. We'll see inventory continue to build a bit in this upcoming quarter, and then, as happens, begin to tail off through the larger seasonal revenue periods.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. My first question is for James. I guess, if you imply the guidance for the June quarter, it's roughly probably a $20 million decline and I guess maybe possibly $10 million from ZTE. But I'm curious on what the decline is outside of that sequentially, acknowledging that there's still strong year-on-year growth trends. But then looking ahead for the full year, how should we think about growth in that segment? I guess you could assume some of the ZTE's business goes somewhere else, but how should we think about the overall yearly impact? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Hey Bill, this is Bob. I want to make sure we understood the question, because I think James is going to be down $10-plus-million quarter-over-quarter. So I know you threw out $20 million, so I want to make sure we're addressing the right part, but that's roughly...","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The $20 million is to get to \u2013 the guidance for Mobile actually increases year-on-year...","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","We're not guiding individual segments, but ZTE will definitely come out in the kind of levels Bob talked about in quarter-over-quarter. And we had a very, very good Q4 as well. And so you see a little bit of leveling between the 26% year-over-year growth in Q4, you'll see that level out a bit in Q1.","As far as the full year, I think we've got continued great things going on in our underlying markets, and we talk about those six markets. We'll talk about more of those when we get into New York. And we've got great tailwinds in trends like the adoption of GaN, the move to 5G, what we see going on in the IoT space. We model those markets to still grow in that 10% to 15% range and we expect to do at or better than those underlying markets.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And I just want to make sure to take care of some housekeeping here. On ZTE, it does affect our revenue. It is included in our guidance in the June quarter. We've also considered it for the full year, so no more ZTE effect beyond what you see in the current guide. It also impacted slightly the margin in this June guide.","Also, we do adopt 606 revenue standard starting in this first quarter. For us, not a material effect, so no concerns there. We're already at sell-in versus sell-out, so for us that was not an issue. And then customer-owned inventory, we have some issues in the company, but it's very manageable and again, not material to our business.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Actually my second question is also for James. The GaN business has obviously \u2013 it looks like it's been going well and there's some opportunities in 5G, I guess, as we look through this year. Can you quantify the run rate for GaN exiting last year and how we should think about the revenue growth rate or run rate as we exit fiscal 2019? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","It's more than just the infrastructure side, Bill. I mean, when we look at GaN, it's into multiple products. But I think we can tell you it's not hundreds of millions. It's not single digit millions. It's a pretty decent percentage of James' total portfolio. But it is one of the faster growing segments that James does have where we've invested in some capital to continue to support his growth there. But go ahead, James.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I \u2013 it's double digit part of the organization today. It's largely in defense broadband and in satellite communications. The base station revenue for us will become more material next year as we see macro and massive MIMO base stations, including 5G move into production ramp. We've got a great process portfolio, a great product portfolio. We're leveraging our packaging innovation and in some cases even stealing shamelessly from Mobile to really drive our packaging cost down. And we have, therefore, the cost and the scale to differentiate in the market.","We've also had a couple of really great product releases in GaN this quarter, so one of those established a record level of output power. We think that's very material in some of our defense space. And then we also released first to market with the film in the other really key millimeter wave band for 5G at 28 gigahertz. So in general, I think we see GaN business continuing to grow. We modeled the market to grow at about 25% and I think we'll continue to pace that same kind of growth level with GaN.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Bob, I'm curious how sensitive are your second half sales to the success of one particular model of the flagship phone versus another? What happens if for example depending on pricing the demand shifts to say the OLED models versus the LCD models because I think that's sort of what tripped up the industry in this last generation. So I'm just curious what kind of assumptions you're making on the kind of mix that you might see.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. The comeback in the assumption what I've said in the past will hold true today. We will not speak about any upcoming phones that not have been announced, have not been in the market. So I'm very sorry, I can't help you with that question. It's a good question, but like past times when it's been asked, I'm not going to be able to help you. When it's in the market, we'll see what happens.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hello. Good afternoon. I had two questions. For my first question, I did want to circle back on inventory. I was hoping you could describe how you would characterize your own level of modules in the channel, given what appears to be still a mismatch between production builds and sell-through of higher-end smartphones. And, I guess, maybe the follow-up to that, would you expect to see the inventory overhang abating at the end of your June quarter, or perhaps could that percolate into the September quarter?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Sorry, Karl. I'm not sure we fully understand your question. Number one, our channel between us and most of our customers is direct. So, we ship it, they build it, et cetera. So I'm not sure what you're meaning. For those customers that we support through distributors and reps in China, we think our inventory levels between us and them are very low as I said in my opening answer to a question around this. So I'm not sure if that addresses your question or not.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Fair enough. I guess maybe as a side question, if I may, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the millimeter wave opportunity, now that you have just launched a 5G base station 28 gigahertz module, and particularly whether you expect to see revenue in calendar 2019? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, we've experienced revenue already in what we would call the last mile applications and we do expect to continue to have that. These are largely demo programs that are getting rolled out in the major city areas around the country. So we have revenue in those markets. I think broader proliferation will start to happen in next calendar year and then really take hold in 2020. Still a lot of speculation about below 6 gigahertz 5G and millimeter wave 5G and I think we'll place our bets in both and see how that plays out over the next couple of years.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish with Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much. I had a couple of clarifications for you, Mark. Just on the free cash flow and gross margin, and they're both kind of interrelated. On the gross margin front, you're keeping your guidance intact versus what you've said in the past. And your free cash flow comes down just a touch if I got it correct between $700 million to $800 million versus $800 million that you had given before?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Ambrish, what I say before our target that I stated before was $800 million, and that very much remains $800 million. I mean, I'm going to be going for over $800 million. But I'm giving you a guide for the year. And it's difficult sometimes to predict when we're going to need CapEx spend or to Craig's earlier comment on working capital management. So there is a risk factor applied to my guide there.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then for my margin question, I just wanted to make sure I understood the margin ramp up in the back half. So I get the underutilization charge and that will reverse. But the \u2013 half of the impact from the 400 bps this quarter is \u2013 in the guided to quarter is from product mix. How does that get corrected by itself, or is it mostly in Mobile, or is it IDP? And how does that transition through the year? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Ambrish, just to clarify, so you're right, half is costs associated with utilization, half is associated with the mix. On the mix, so 200 basis points, about 50 basis points of that is truly Mobile versus IDP mix within Qorvo. So just more Mobile business. And then about 100 basis points is mix within Mobile, so higher volume of legacy products relative to advanced or newer products.","And we do expect as we've talked about before and we've reinforced in this call, we expect that to reverse and new products to drive up margins going forward. And then, the other 50 basis points is just some other smaller factors, including a little bit of IDP impacts and including the ZTE effect which we talked about earlier.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks a lot. I'll start with Eric. It sounds like you've landed quite a bit of content in Phase 6 platform. Can you give us an idea of generally where that goes for like the base case? I know the base case maybe a super PAD, but then you've talked about upside cases, include envelope tracking, tuning and maybe antenna plexer. So just in general, are we talking like the base case $1 to $2 in total content going to $8 to $10 or just help us quantify maybe what that is.","And then for James, Cree announced the acquisition of Infineon's RF business which gives them a direct channel right into the wireless infrastructure OEMs that you're addressing in some of your things. And given that they're the supplier to you for silicon carbide, does this change the dynamic at all, because prior to this, they really weren't a big supplier there, so now they can both supply you and compete with you? I'm just curious, how that affects or does it affect your view of it? And then I have a follow-up with Mark, please.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Go ahead, Eric.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. So in terms of the dollar content opportunity for us specific to China, if I understood the question right, as we move through these phase architectures from two through six, we see probably the largest single step between generations going from sort of the three, five to the six. But there's also a broad range of different applications in different dollar content implications.","As I mentioned, we've got MIMO implemented, Power Class 2, higher power across really all the bands. We have more bands integrated. We have 40% smaller size, which obviously commands a premium in the ASP. And then we have some applications which are actually looking to bring UHB in as well. And so there's a broad range of ASPs, but significantly higher dollar content over what's shipping in the market today.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And Ed to your question about the supply chain from Cree, we actually have multiple supply chains to support James' business. Cree is as you pointed out one of them. I think we have excellent relationship with them. They made it clear to us they will continue to support us. So it's our expectations we will continue to have multiple supply chains to support James' business.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Okay. And then Mark, if I could, question kind of on CapEx. I know it's not a \u2013 it's going down again here too, but if you look at your mix coming up here between the Phase 6 wins, which has got a lot of BAW associated with it, of course the superPAD is your largest customer, and you got the quadplexers now shipping into China with the new phones there. I mean, BAW sounds like it's on a steadily increasing pace and that kind of dovetails with your guidance. When do you expect, or do you expect that you'll have to ramp Farmers Branch at some point? And can you just remind us where you are on that, is it qualified, is it production ready? Are you guys still working on it?","And then if I could, I don't know if Steve's there, Steve Grant there, but if not, maybe Eric can handle this one. Along the same exact lines, you've shipped BAW to your \u2013 high performance, high frequency BAW to your largest customer in the past on six inch. How confident are you that you can supply the needs, especially your largest customer, using just six-inch instead of having to move to eight inch. And if you have to move to eight inch, what kind of risk are you looking at in terms of yields? Do you feel comfortable whether there's something you didn't have volume production before? Thanks, guys.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Ed, as far as the ramping on six inch and eight inch et cetera, you're correct, Steve's not here, he'll get into this I'm sure at the upcoming investor conference in May, later this month. But we're very confident in our yields what they've been running on six inch as well as on eight inch. So we will have production coming through this year on eight inch. We'll go through a little more detail on that at the Investor Day, but Ed, we're up and running on eight inch and we've talked about that in the past. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Ed, we're still obviously trying to do everything we can to avoid additional CapEx dollars. But the CapEx dollars we are spending are majority BAW. And that's despite efforts to convert more six inch to eight inch and die shrink programs will help. But Farmers Branch is not going to be needed this year. We'd be able to get it ready to go. And certainly the yields and what's being produced there in test is very good. So we're ready and we'll turn it on when it's needed maybe as early as next year.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Krysten with Nomura Instinet.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura Instinet","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is just a housekeeping question, were there any 10% plus customers for the quarter? And approximately what percentage of revenues were they?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Krysten, one 10% customer.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thanks. And then following up on that particular customer, I know in prior conference calls, you've noted that this upcoming refresh will be one of the largest content gains gen-over-gen. Has anything changed in that, or do you still see that to be true?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I think, Krysten, the way I think I'd like to answer that is we're still very confident in our BAW-based designs. I talked a lot in my opening comments as well about answering questions that we continue to expect a significant BAW ramp this year. We're supporting multiple customers and really look forward to second half of the year.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question for Mark. Mark, what changed on the gross margins coming down in the second quarter? The SAW underutilization, is it something on your side, or is it a change in the customer product mix? And then I have a follow-up.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","So, by second quarter, I'm assuming you mean second calendar, the June quarter. So, yes, just to remind folks, we've got two factors occurring. One is mix related issues and the other is, Atif, as you point out, these costs associated with SAW capacity underutilization.","No problem with the parts other than we don't have enough SAW to sell. It's simply an accounting convention. When we experience abnormal levels of utilization, the fixed cost cannot be allocated to unit production so they need to pass through as period costs. And that's the effect you're seeing most pronounced in June, in part because through the year, its highest level is in June and then we have our lowest revenues. So on a percent basis, of course, it has the largest effect.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then a follow-up for Eric. Eric, if I look at the teardown of a phone that's already out, Galaxy 9, there is a combination of mid and high band PAD in that phone and architecturally the Korean handset maker is not too far behind the U.S. handset maker. But with respect to Chinese handset makers, how far behind you think they are in terms of adopting something similar where the mid and the high bands are getting combined? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. That's a great question. And I think that's fundamentally what's driving this significant shift in the Mobile portfolio throughout this year. We're finding that highly integrated modules that combine coverage for mid and high frequencies and allow you to very elegantly at a low loss support carrier aggregation combinations across all of that. They really help customers get to market with the leading edge handsets and that's applying widely to many customers in many segments.","And really when you look at our Phase 6 solution, that's exactly what that is as well. You've got a low band module and then you got a mid and high integrated module, so solves all that complexity. So I think throughout this year, as we exit this year, you're going to see a lot of different instances of handsets from different customers and different tiers adopting similar technology.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. I had two questions. One, Mark, if I heard you right, I think you said you're looking for 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2019. Just wondering from a broad brush, can you give us sort of what are the biggest drivers? Is it sort of the ramp of mid band, high band PADs? Is it China coming back? Is it continued growth in IDP? What are the biggest drivers?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I'll just say generally, Quinn, we're experiencing good design win momentum across our customer base. And of course, and then many of the things Eric talked about, Phase 6 is a good example. And so we've seen our strength in China improve even further. And then, of course, James' business, a small sequential decline in the June quarter, but still year-over-year growth, and then that growth picks back up again to double digits in the rest of the year.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as my follow-up for Eric, it sounds like BAW-based products are 22% or 23% of your business in fiscal 2018, expect to be about 30% in fiscal 2019. If I just take consensus estimates, it feels like your BAW-based products go from about $500 million in fiscal 2018 to somewhere around $700 million in fiscal 2018. I guess I would think with the custom mid band, high band PAD and Phase 6 products ramping, you'd have a heck of a lot more than $200 million of growth. Can you help me reconcile that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Sorry. I'm not sure I understand all of the questions. We've given you a lot of data out there and that's your model. I'm not sure how to even begin to answer that. We always have a lot of moving parts that are out there. I think we also mentioned in the last call we weren't participating in some high volume products that use SAW which is why we've got a fab utilization problem. So I'm not going to get into modeling every bit of Eric's business. I'm sorry. I can't help you with that one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. If I'm correct, your 9% to 10% fiscal 2019 growth suggests that in the second half of this calendar year your Mobile Products should grow year-over-year. And if that's right, can you give us some idea of how that is split between content growth and unit growth?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, David, just a clarification. I mean, Mobile returns to year-over-year growth actually in the June quarter. So that's noteworthy, maybe we should have mentioned that earlier, so thank you for the question. As far as the content growth, we are experiencing content growth, but I'll leave it to Eric to go into any details.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. It's a tough question to answer. Certainly, in terms of handsets, we're not counting on unit growth in the industry. It's content that's growing our TAM. Within our own business, certainly for the most part, that's also the case. We're selling fewer parts that have higher content at a pretty dramatic ratio, although there's other parts in the market like ET and antenna tuning which will be growth drivers as well, which are driven by a lot of unit growth as well.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And in IDP, if one backs out all the ZTE effects, would you actually expect to continue to see 20-plus-percent growth through fiscal 2019 in IDP?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, as I said earlier, we model those underlying markets 10% to 15%. I expect it will do at or better than that. Still very, very bullish about the business. Mark mentioned earlier design wins. We had fantastic design win last year. We were actually up 20-some-odd-percent year-over-year. So I think business is strong, but right now we're modeling it 10% to 15%.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Mark, I'm still trying to figure out the mix of the Mobile business for March and June. Can you give us maybe a little bit of clarity on either the percentage of revenue from the largest customer or maybe from China in March? And then what is modeled for June? Thanks.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","No. I mean, I'm not going to give you percentages on our largest customer other than they're a 10% customer. We had a \u2013 as I mentioned, for the June quarter, well, we talked about the March quarter and strengthening in China, which was stronger than expected. We're seeing that continuing into the June quarter.","And then furthermore, we just have the sort of transition period whereby we've got more legacy products and later generation or older products in the cycle here that are in the mix in the June quarter. We expect that to turn through the year, of course, with a number of handset launches and our product portfolio is a higher margin portfolio through the back half of the year.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then I'm just wondering bigger picture, if you look at there's just been so much chop in the supply chain for some of the big smartphone customers. And I guess from a big picture, is there a change in the way that they're managing inventory, maybe extending some of the programs that they have with contract manufacturers and sort of how they hold inventory on their own balance sheets? And does that impact the sort of seasonality in your business as you look to the back half of the year? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I think it's best to really ask the contract manufacturers what's going on on their end. I think I've mentioned before a lot of our large customers are on hubs. We ship into them. They pull from that and build phones and ship them. So you'll have to ask them what they're doing with their subcontractors. I'm sorry we're not able to answer that anymore.","Operator","All right. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We believe we are better positioned than ever to capture our markets' highest growth and most complex opportunities. We expect this to drive content gains across products and markets.

At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Douglas Toledo, Vice President of Investor Relations for Qorvo. Please go ahead","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, very much Kathy. Hello everybody and welcome to Qorvo's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide the supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com under investors.

Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Qorvo delivered a very strong September quarter with both revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance range. In Mobile Products, revenue was $630 million with 38% sequential growth. Qorvo supported the ramps of leading marquee smartphones and increased our dollar content on key customer programs.","We also benefited from an improved demand environment in China with the launch of flagship devices at Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others. At Huawei, we supported the Mate 10 with BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and our envelope tracking power management solution. At Xiaomi, we shipped more than $9 of RF content including our highly-integrated RF Fusion products into their top-tier Mi Mix 2 and we were honored to receive their partnership award. We expect our design momentum at both accounts to continue in next-generation flagship models.","In IDP, revenue increased 21% year-over-year to a record $190 million with standout performance in the defense and connectivity markets. IDP is targeting double-digit year-over-year revenue growth across a broad set of customers in defense, base station, automotive, smart home IoT, Wi-Fi and optical. Customers in these target markets require differentiated products with higher levels of integration, higher power, lower noise figure, better linearity and greater efficiency and this is where Qorvo excels.","IDP has been putting up robust year-over-year revenue growth and our design wins in the September quarter point to another strong quarter in December. We're very confident in our long-term growth prospects given the underlying macro trends of IoT, 5G and GaN. In both mobile and IDP, Qorvo is benefiting as the increasing demand for data is ratcheting up the complexity, driving integration and increasing RF content. The depth and breadth of our technology portfolio position us uniquely to selectively target the most attractive market segments based on the competitive environment, market or customer exposure, technologies required and the value we can bring.","Take for example our success in Wi-Fi\/ISMs. A few years ago, we saw this as a category we could disrupt by combining our market-leading BAW coexist filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. That's playing out today and we see continued growth ahead for our Wi-Fi\/ISMs across retail, CPE and mobile devices.","The same is true with our industry-leading envelope tracking power management solutions. We recognize the market opportunity for advanced power management over a decade ago, built a robust IP portfolio and we're now expanding our product offerings to support not only cellular but also Wi-Fi applications. In the September quarter, we launched our ET PMIC for Wi-Fi supporting a wearable device. This is an industry first and we have additional opportunities ahead.","Likewise, Qorvo's early innovation in antenna tuning is paying off today. The tuning content in marquee smartphones will nearly double this year and we expect this segment will continue to outpace the overall RF market. Qorvo enjoys a strong leadership position and we have multiple opportunities to expand our content across new and existing customers.","In GaN, Qorvo is an industry pioneer and technology leader and our investments in GaN are supporting exceptional growth. In fact, our GaN-related revenue in the September quarter doubled year-over-year. We've also seen our opportunities grow tremendously in IoT. Qorvo's IoT revenue in the September quarter increased by 50% versus last year. During the quarter, we secured an RF front-end module design win supporting the Tile tracker family. We also secured multiple design wins for automotive IoT applications supporting top automakers with content per car up to $7.","In China, we enjoyed strong demand with the deployment of 900 megahertz narrow band IoT infrastructure. Qorvo's narrow band IoT solutions optimize performance and power consumption in high-volume low-power IoT applications. Finally, in defense we secured multiyear design wins with a major defense contractor for high power, high-efficiency gas components supporting several advanced radar applications. All of these achievements represent strategic investments made by Qorvo that are paying off today.","Looking forward, let's cover a few examples of what we see driving our growth in the future. As we've indicated before, we're leveraging a unique set of capabilities to target the most promising growth opportunities within the largest profit pools. In infrastructure, we've expanded our product portfolio to include a line of small signal products that support the 600 megahertz band 71. This makes Qorvo the only supplier to address all 5G frequency bands from 600 megahertz through 39 gigahertz.","We also expanded our family of GaN discrete transistor products, with a GaN-on-silicon carbide dual-transistor module. The new module enables base station customers to achieve ultra high levels of power efficiency and reduce costs versus traditional process technologies.","Finally, we're on track with a custom development program integrating multiple BAW multiplexers with PAs, switches and LNAs. We believe these technologies and design capabilities will enable Qorvo to pursue the most attractive segments of the RF market.","Qorvo's BAW delivers lower loss, higher Q and superior power-handling capability, making it optimal for enabling carrier aggregation and we expect BAW will be increasingly favored as operators require better power-handling with the move to Power Class 2.","Finally, with the migration of 5G, we expect the bands using BAW today will continue to use BAW and some SAW bands will move to BAW. We view this as the inevitability of BAW. We're developing and bringing to market a number of exciting BAW-based products for the main path as well as diversity path and we expect to increase our BAW based revenue as industry requirements favor our higher performance products. Simply put, BAW growth outpaces filters, filter growth outpaces RF and RF content will outpace smartphone units.","With that as a backdrop, it's noteworthy that what sets Qorvo apart isn't any one best-in-class capability, it's the entirety of our product and technology portfolio. We see that as increasingly powerful as the discrete functions are integrated into single placement modules. Our customers are moving towards increasingly complex, more highly integrated placements and Qorvo is focused on operational excellence and product and technology leadership to best address our customer's needs.","In the September quarter, the Qorvo team executed extremely well, expanding product portfolios, generating design wins and earning the enhanced customer trust that accompanies the clean launch of key customer programs. We strengthened our business processes to drive productivity while also investing in sustainable long-term growth in competing for the industry's most complex and most valuable placements where technology wins.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the second quarter was $821 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $11 million. Mobile revenue was $630 million, was driven by growth at our largest customer and stronger China business. IDP revenue of $190 million reflects continued strength in defense including advanced radars and other electronic warfare products. And in connectivity, including Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications.","Gross margin in the quarter was 47.4%, a sequential increase of 10 basis points and a year-over-year increase of 460 basis points. Gross margin in the quarter was negatively impacted by the after effects of Hurricane Irma, which caused an isolated air contamination issue in our Florida fab. The operations team in Florida did a remarkable job to quickly identify root cause and bring the fab back up without any customer impact. Excluding these costs, gross margin in the quarter would've been above our guidance. While as expected, overall fab utilization weighed on margins in the quarter operationally, the business is performing exceptionally well supporting customers through seasonal ramps.","Operating expenses were $158 million, down on ongoing productivity efforts and spend timing. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $231 million, or 28.1% of sales, up 660 basis points from the prior quarter and 530 basis points versus last year.","During the second quarter, we took certain actions, including a head count reduction program, to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. As we've discussed, we're focused on achieving consistent operational excellence and continuously improving our effectiveness and efficiency. We believe a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio, containing costs and driving a culture of continuous improvement will lead to greater sales growth and profitability and help us maximize free cash flow.","Non-GAAP net income was $198 million. Diluted earnings per share was $1.52, $0.09 over the midpoint of our guidance. Second-quarter cash flow from operations more than doubled sequentially to $220 million. Capital expenditures decreased to $68 million as we wrap up recent expansions, tool conversions and other investments to support future growth. Cash at quarter-end was $575 million. We repurchased $57 million of stock in the quarter and intend to continue buying as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.","Let's turn to our outlook. In the fiscal year 2018 third quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $830 million and $850 million, gross margin of approximately 47.5% and diluted EPS of $1.60 at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance reflects our view on near-term demand for our customers' flagship models and continued strength in IDP. Sequentially, we expect gross margin to remain roughly flat, primarily due to mix effects. We expect gross margin expansion to resume in the March quarter and into next year, with improving mix, ongoing productivity efforts and increasing fab utilization. Operating expenses are forecast to remain flat at approximately $158 million for the December quarter.","Our outlook also reflects a recent event at a supplier. In mid-October, one of our laminate suppliers had a fire and shut down production. We quickly launched a recovery plan to minimize the impact of the event. Thanks to close and collaborative working relationships with customers and our other qualified suppliers and the exceptional efforts of our engineering, operations, quality and sales teams, we don't expect any major customer impacts. Our estimate of revenue and cost impacts of the event have been factored into today's guidance.","For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we forecast revenue to decline less than seasonally December to March. In the second half, we expect double-digit year-over-year growth, with gains on new mobile platforms and continued strong IDP growth.","OpEx is forecast to be down in dollars from fiscal 2017, as we continue to drive towards our operating model of 20% of sales or lower. We project CapEx to trend lower through the rest of the year, ending the full year below $300 million or less than 10% of sales.","So wrapping up, in the second quarter, we delivered another quarter above our guidance. For the second half, we're forecasting a return to double-digit year-over-year growth, with expanding operating margins and increasing free cash flow. Our technology investments are paying off; our operations are running well and ready for growth; our operating costs are in control and declining; and our free cash flow is strong and improving.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Okay. And we'll take our first question from Mike Burton with Longbow Research.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the \u2013 good to see recovery in China in the September quarter. Do you think your outperformed the market in calendar Q3 due to those ramps that you mentioned? And then looking to December, do you expect the market overall to be up? And do you expect to be in line or better than that as those ramps continue to play through? Thanks.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Hey, Mike. This is Eric. I'll take that. We did have strength in the September quarter on China design wins in flagship products primarily. A lot of chunky dollar content across power amplifiers, switches, tuners, Wi-Fi and so forth, as we mentioned, and the Xiaomi win is just one example. So as those ramped up to begin filling their lines of distribution, we did see a bump in September.","Going into December, we're continuing to be pretty cautious in terms of what we think the forecasted actual sell-through of those units will be in December. We still see generally in China a mix toward the mid-tier which as of now, still doesn't require carrier aggregation, so little dollar content. The growth we are seeing in units is really heading towards India. Again, prices in RF content similar to mid-tier handsets instead of the flagships. So it's really very similar to what we saw last quarter but with a bump in September due to the ramp of these new flagships with a lot of Qorvo content.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thanks. And then also for Eric, was Samsung a 10% customer in the quarter? And what are your expectations for them going into Q4? I think usually they're down pretty hard in Q4 but just hoping you could help us detail your progress with them?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, Mike. This is Mark. They were not a 10% customer in the quarter.","Operator","Okay. We'll go to our next question Krysten Sciacca with Nomura\/Instinet.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura\/Instinet","Hi. Good evening, guys. First question, did you have any other 10% plus customers for the quarter?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","We did have a 10% customer. Our largest customer was 40%.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Nomura\/Instinet","Okay. Thank you. Excellent. And then moving on to the automotive design win you mentioned in your prepared comments, can you kind of describe what exact functionality that design win was for? And when we should expect to see that to start to really show up in revenues? I know that sale cycles can be a bit long there.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, this is James. We're really focused on key aspects in the automotive being Wi-Fi, LTE chipsets and SDARS. The particular design wins we talked about were LTE-based and, again, we would expect revenue to begin later this year, early next year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Eric, if we could go back to China real quick. It sounds like there's some puts and takes that are maybe not giving you the best visibility but if you look at it on an annual basis, maybe calendar 2017, calendar 2018, what are your expectations for growth? You're getting flagship design wins that are giving you some dollar content but then you're going to get a shift towards these mid-tier products that are lesser and then you're also getting growth outside of China that's probably also lesser dollar content.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, we think that the trend is clear. I mean, timing is always hard to nail down but the trend is very clear just as it is with all of our markets. There is an ongoing demand for more data and that does fundamentally drive the complexity in the RF and the value, as we've talked about many times. Currently, the lack of requirement for carrier aggregation, I mean, that's just a current cycle sort of situation. It's not long term, we don't believe. And as an example, today, carrier aggregation is only required this year in handsets over RMB 3,000 and if that returns to handsets over RMB 1,500, as is the current proposal, that would take the market requirement from 15% CA enabled up to 50% CA enabled. And of course, that's a trend that we'd very much like to see. We believe at some point next year that that requirement will come back.","That combined with our customers looking at \u2013 more and more looking at exporting into higher-value parts of the market, requiring more carrier aggregation for even EU SKUs. And India, as it transitions to more premium tiers, our China customers are ready to capitalize on that. The India spectrum, actually, is quite fragmented and so as they demand higher data rates to compete with the rest of the world's carriers, it's natural that they'll need carrier aggregation. The frequencies are higher. It's going to be BAW-based quadplexers for India well. I think that's a real exciting market as a matter of fact. Not only our China customers, but Samsung and others are doing well in and we think India could be as much as $1 billion opportunity for RF in calendar 2020. So the long-term trends are very much intact.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","So do you have a swag (22:52) at what the longer-term CAGR is for that type of customer basically?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So I think, in general, it's growing roughly in line with our overall CAGR. I don't have an exact number off the top of my head but in the 10% to 12% range still.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, wanted to address the timing shifts that you had mentioned. If you look at the consensus guidance or consensus expectations on the Street going into the call, you guys are guiding about $50 million or so below that level. I know you don't have access to all of our models but can you give us any sort of sense, how much revenue we may be talking about was affected by timing shifts from, perhaps, December into March?","And then second question for Bob, you guys \u2013 cutting heads here to streamline expenses which is good to hear long-term, but I think you've talked about some very important projects. You've got this custom module development for your largest customer. I think you guys have also acknowledged that you're not spending a lot today in diversity receipts (24:00), so it seems like there's some pretty big opportunities that you could have diverted those resources towards. Any reason why you didn't shift those resources to some of those projects?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Quinn. The first part of your question was I think you were expecting \u2013 I think you said $890 million and we gave you $840 million. And number one, I think we exceeded last quarter by about $10 million but let's not split hairs there. And IDP is tracking exactly as planned, so it's little bit off in the mobile area. And I'll let Eric talk about a little bit about it and we'll address the second part of the question","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. It is clear that the outlook for mobile in Q3 is lower than previous expectations. We've talked about it. It's related to flagship product sales or at least our take on the forecast for those, what we're expecting, it's across multiple customers, not just one customer. I think it's pretty clear and public now that our largest customer has a delayed overall product cycle compared to past years; that, that clearly has an effect. And many are speculating that it's affecting the entire market because a lot of the premium handset buyers are waiting to get their hands on the very latest models and they want to try those before they decide, regardless of what they buy. So we feel at least like there's been a general push out during the cycle.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Maybe, Quinn, just to close the loop on revenues. So it is a difficult quarter to forecast for the reasons that Eric and Bob mentioned. And then as we look out into March, as far as what sort of seasonal dip we see, more muted than normal so right now we're calling low- to mid-single digits on a decrease from December to March.","And then as far as OpEx, we are not changing any priorities on our programs. In fact, we would view this as narrowing the focus on the most valuable opportunities we have. The company's matured in its merger. We're on a common system now. We've got \u2013 done a lot of work around defining processes and making them more efficient, reducing defects. And it's just allowing us to be more efficient. So we're at the point where we can take some more targeted actions that don't interfere with our growth plans and we did that. We ended up \u2013 at the end of the day, we'll have net about 300 people that are reduced in the company. About 200 of those are cost of goods folks and 100 are in the OpEx category.","And as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to see OpEx specifically as a percent of sales to trend down. This year we believe we'll end between 20% and 21% of sales. And then next year see that drop.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. Could we get to the gross margin, please? I just want to make sure I understand this. In the fiscal third quarter, revenues are up but you're guiding it down. And I think you alluded to a mix issue, but \u2013 so that was my first part, what mix issue. And then a related question is, sounds like \u2013 are you backing out from the 50% target that you had given exiting the fiscal year? And if you are, then how should investors think about the trajectory of the gross margin expansion that you said it will start to expand beyond March? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Okay. So let me \u2013 this is Mark \u2013 I'll take the questions in the part. So first, on the second quarter, we reported 47.4% and as you mentioned, the guide is relatively flat. If you add back the Florida issue we had around air contamination, you end up \u2013 we were at really 48% normalized margin. And the decrease from that 48% to the 47.5% that we guided, so 50 basis points is primarily related to the increase of our low-band PAD in the mix, which we've been clear about before. I've never indicated that the margin expansion that we have planned would be linear, and this is an example where we're increasing but modestly. And in fact, if you normalize the margins, second quarter we are down but, again, because of mix.","Talking gross margin more generally, we absolutely are not backing off on our target. For the year, we don't foresee ending the year at 50% as we had hoped but I will say that from \u2013 this is our fourth consecutive quarter of a gross margin increase and as we mentioned, we expect to increase that again in December and then again in the March quarters. And excluding this Florida effect in the second quarter, we've made or beat our gross margin guidance in each quarter over the past year.","So the important thing is that we're able to forecast. We understand the drivers. I'm certainly not saying it's easy but we do believe and there are things out of our control, as Florida indicated, but we do have a handle on what's going on. We're not pleased with the gross margin, as I said last quarter. Not where we want to be, not where we expected to be.","But we do see a roadmap to 50% as we talked about before. How we're going to get there? We're going to get there through volume growth, which as you heard in our Investor Day, we do expect to outpace the market. We expect that volume growth to be on our better margin products. BAW enabled revenue specifically, which we've talked about the criticality of that in both mix and loading our fabs. Tuners, PMICs and then IDP as a mix of the business generally, has been increasing and that helps us on the margin. Utilization, we've talked about, is our biggest drag on margin and I'm happy to say that we believe we've reached the low point in this second quarter and forecast improvements on utilization through the rest of this year and into next year.","Finally, we've got a number of productivity projects that are still underway. Improving yield, shrinking die, traceability of projects, and then of course, the wafer expansions that we've talked about before and then reduce the capital intensity associated with that. So, again, confident in our ability to reach that target and actually exceed it in time. And for the rest of this year, we do expect margin expansion from December to March.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you for answering a difficult question and you should be given credit from recovering from the trough. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, Eric, I was hoping you could give us an update on the development efforts at your largest customer, which you talked about last quarter. How do you feel about that opportunity today relative to three or six months ago in terms of actually winning that business? And in terms of timing, when would you and when would we do we know whether or not you actually do win that business?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question. We're very excited about the opportunity. We believe we continue to be on track. We've learned a tremendous amount as we've gone through this development. It's improving our technology and our design capability and our prototyping and we're delivering high-volume samples today. And so we continue to believe we're on track. It's not over until it's over. And to answer your question, it's roughly the end of the calendar year approximately that we should have more clarity on that.","In the meantime, as we commented earlier as well, the outcome from this in terms of technology and design capability and so forth, is going to impact a lot of other programs as well. As we see, generally, the industry's toughest most value problems are centered around enabling CA in the mid and high bands and driving higher levels of integration there. So this is a very, very important product. We're still quite confident that we're on track and it's going to grow well beyond that with the capability it's bringing us.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, we've all heard quite a bit over the past couple of days in terms of how market share in the modem market could potentially change going forward. I was hoping you guys can remind us how different your opportunity is with the Intel SKUs as opposed to the Qualcomm SKUs. Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, it's an interesting question to think about. Now if you step back from it, the fact is we're developing a full complement of RF solutions with all the functionality needed for the entire RF front end and driving, of course, particularly on the advanced carrier aggregation based systems that are kind of in the premium tier. And we really, we make those up with all base bands out there, so Qualcomm, Intel, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Samsung, LSI. I mean, we're engaged in winning revenue and delivering production on all those platforms today.","So on one sense, we're agnostic. We are a supplier to the entire industry and the RF is selected, in many cases, separate from the base band. Having said that, if you look at what's in the market today, it's clear that we have very good alignment with Intel and we do enjoy working with them and I think our ET track, in particular, has been a real success there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. First question is on inventory. Could you describe how you would characterize your own levels of modules in the channel given all the ramps of new flagship devices you're seeing across your top customers? And I guess given that your top three customers in mobile are ramping various devices, is there a greater propensity for you and your customers to engage in longer-term contract agreements with you on a quarterly basis that would increase your backlog and visibility more so than you have had historically? And I have a follow-up, please.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Let me take a shot at that, Karl. As far as our major customers and how we do business, and I commented this on the last quarter as well, we have what we'll call schedule share agreements where they project their demand out for about a year and we react to that. So from agreement perspectives, yes, we've got contracts like that but the backlog \u2013 it's visibility for a year. And we know it's going to change week-to-week because we, as consumers, don't know when we're going to buy phones. So that's the predominant share of our market today. It's done that way with our high-volume large customers.","So, as far as the ramps go with maybe some of our customers in China, they are getting more sophisticated as their phones get more complex and they need to ensure that capacity is in place and things like that. So we are getting, now, much better visibility out of that set of customers that two years ago, we sure didn't get. So overall, I'd say yes it's improving and it's that perspective of understanding their plans, the issue is as always, how successful are the phones when they get launched to market?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","I would just bring \u2013 Karl, maybe just bring it to a tactical level. Part of the reason our utilization has been poor, one of the factors is, we are very much trying to drive our own inventory levels down. So focusing on not loading the fabs for the purpose of inventory and all those associated risks and cash strain. And then also, related, we do see we're watching the China inventory channels very closely and those have gotten more healthy through the year. So we're pleased about that development.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess as a follow up to that then, and this really is to your longer-term margin profile. I do understand that margins were a bit challenged due to some one-offs this quarter and, of course, your current margin outlook is for 50% gross margins and 30% op margins. Though about two years ago you had articulated being able to expand gross margins toward even up to 55% margins. Now that China smartphone is beginning to improve after a tumultuous first half and you're increasing shift more of your manufacturing onto larger sized wafers next year and, presumably, the headwind on this low-band PAD abates, I guess what is inhibiting you from achieving that target over the next year or two?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","No, I think, Karl, you've laid out the drivers that we believe will be able to achieve the target. Back in that period there was a lot of discrete BAW and as you heard Eric say, the requirement for CA dropped and we've seen that BAW market get weaker than we expected. We expect tremendous BAW growth over the next several years and that's going to load our largest fab, which is our largest drain on margin. Furthermore, we continue to make, just as we have from our last low-band PAD version to this one, continual improvements in manufacturing yields and just the way we do the product to improve the margin in that product. And those are certainly factors that will help us going forward on margin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks, guys. I guess one for each, if I could, and I'll just put them out there and we can answer them in order. Bob, you mentioned the net ET PMIC for Wi-Fi. Is that in the mobile group or is that James' group?","James, what's your GaN split between defense and cellular infrastructure? I know you're more heavily weighted to the former. Are you getting much traction in the cellular side of it? And if you could maybe give us an overview of where you are on most of your Wi-Fi CPEs but are you doing anything with the iFEM side of the business?","And then, Eric, your tuner content seems to be ramping fairly rapidly. How much of that correlates to the big increase we're seeing in antenna count in the flagship models? And how much is just a wider spread of bands or a quest for better performance on existing bands? And could you maybe update us on the Wi-Fi iFEM business, which seems to be taking off? I know the Chinese OEMs were moving into it \u2013 and are moving into already shipping into production there you must be. And what do you think the chances are of that product moving into your largest customers?","And then finally, Mark, I know in a perfect world \u2013 what's your best guess on \u2013 in a perfect world if the gross margins are down on utilization at Richardson and Richardson doesn't budge forever, how much of a penalty did you take this quarter? I'm just trying to get an idea of what it could have been if you were running at more normal levels. I know you said it bottomed this quarter but just trying to get a quantitative number on what you're suffering due to Richardson. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Ed, thanks for your questions and appreciate you giving me the easiest one. The ET PMICs that I mentioned for Wi-Fi is in the cellular group, so I appreciate that one. James, if you want to address the GaN split, CPE infrastructure, defense; how many different places we sell GaN, that would be helpful for him.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","And I'll do Wi-Fi as well.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","That'd be great.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Ed. We continue to see strength with GaN as we reported it doubled year-over-year. I think we'll see that trend moving forward into the next quarter. Largely been driven by defense, cable TV and our VSAT business. You ask when base station revenue will become material, and we see that in the next year or so as our products in both macro and Massive MIMO base stations, including early things for 5G move into production ramp.","If I go into the Wi-Fi side, what's really driven the business is, you mentioned iFEMs, has been our work in iFEMs and being able to integrate some great technologies into a common box. That's fueled tremendous amount of growth in the connectivity business as well. That business was up 81% year-over-year. So fantastic growth in that product set for the company. We're also laying the long-term foundation there as we transition to ax, and we believe our products will really enable that high throughput and the thermal performance that's required for the next standard coming along.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Eric, do you want to pick up on Wi-Fi as well and then move into the tuner question?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Absolutely. So the Wi-Fi for mobile, the industry traditionally was served through system in package in which the Wi-Fi iFEMs and filters and so forth would be sold to a module integrator. And that's still were the flagship of our \u2013 couple of our largest customers are. And the China market, as you indicated, it moved a little faster towards disintegrated that system in package and buying the integrated front-end modules from us. And certainly for the flagship devices coming out of China today that are running 2x2 MIMO, they're typically using a pair of iFEMs for high-performance.","Now your question is the \u2013 when might that penetrate our largest customers and their marquee handsets? I think in order for that structural change to happen, it's going to be driven by technology like LAA. Whenever the Wi-Fi and the cellular start actually commingling more directly and sharing antennas and amplifiers and so forth, especially in the 5 gig area, that's where I think we could see a disruption that might change that architecture.","Then, let's see. The first question you asked was about the tuner content going up. We are very pleased with the tuner business. It's going very well for us. It's driven, as you said by the increased antenna count, in particular to support MIMO. But complicated and actually increased further beyond that by the antenna sharing as well. So once they're adding more antennas but there's only so many antennas they can add. There's just not that much physical space. The transition to these full screen displays has made the area for antennas even less. So they're adding antennas but they're doing their best to add the fewest they can.","So they're sharing antennas as much as possible between Wi-Fi and cellular, as an example. And when they do that there's a need for a couple of things, not just increased tuner content but also these antenna plexers so that you can multiplex signal in and out of a given antenna element to various places. So there's just a tremendous amount of work and innovation going on right now. We have a fantastic team of applications engineers and designers working to help our customers really manage these antenna networks. It is where a ton of value is being generated right now in the industry.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. Mark, the question about Richardson impact to gross margin?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. And, Ed, there is a lot of variables in this and a lot of complexity in the network. The gross margin impact of our utilization on the fabs is around 200 basis points in the quarter and so more than offsets that depreciation benefit we talked about last quarter. And Texas, as you know, is our largest fab. So it's over half of that.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","Okay. We'll go to our next question. Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, I guess first off, a near-term question. If we think about just the December quarter, you talked about continued strength in IDP but I guess the sequential point of view, can you give us a feel for the sequential growth for IDP and, I guess, mobile products?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Give us a sec there, Bill.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And, Bill, just to be clear, are you talking just for the quarter?","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, just for the quarter or I guess within embedded in the guidance, what kind of sequential growth, I guess, are we looking at for IDP?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Mid-single digits.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, that the business grew, you know, over 20% in the second quarter and we're expecting similar year-over-year growth in the third quarter.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Terrific. So I guess that probably puts us on track to maybe perhaps exceed our 15%, I guess, prior target you mentioned in the last quarter from a year-on-year point of view. I guess the details will come out in the Q in terms of operating performance but can you give us a feel for how we are relative to the model of 60% gross margin, 30% ops?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, I'll just make a general statement that James has managed to be well ahead of his model. And, in fact, in this quarter, he actually exceeded 30% operating margin in the business.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And we're expecting him to do it again next quarter.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Terrific results in that segment. Great.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And we'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Bob and one for Mark. For the first one, if my math is right, I think you're guiding March to roughly $70 million, so definitely better than seasonal. Is that based on firm orders? Because March often tends to be seasonally quite soft, visibility is perhaps not as great. So I'm just wondering, Bob, what are the assumptions underlying that.","And for Mark, on the gross margin side, I think you mentioned gross margins will be flat in December because of mix but if your largest U.S. customer is perhaps weaker and IDP is better and I assume you recover some of the fab issues, shouldn't gross margins be up sequentially in December? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Vivek, I need to ask a clarifying question for the March quarter. What did you say you had, revenue...?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Basically because you're saying second half will be up 10%, so I'm just sort of trying to \u2013 I hope my math is right, but if -","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, what we said is second-half, year-over-year, would be double digits. And then we also said, Vivek, that we'd be down December to March low- to mid-single digits.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. That's what I'm wondering that March you're guiding but visibility and other things tend to be seasonally softer. So is your forecast based on firm orders or is it based on some other assumptions?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Vivek, number one, I want to make sure. We don't agree with your $700 million, $70 million or whatever. I couldn't hear you correctly. So we think we're going to be down mid-single digits when we look at March versus December and that's based on, as always, our judgment of our customer's forecast. And as I said, the majority of our business is run off scheduled shares so from a visibility perspective, provided the marquee phones sell as well as they do, the marquee phones that we know it our largest customer. The ramp of that profile is different than what we've seen in prior years. They've announced that. I'm sure tomorrow they'll have more color on it. So factoring in all these things, that's how we get to we think we're going to be down mid-single digits in the March quarter.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And then, Vivek, on the margin, as we all know, this is unusual seasonality and so the fact of the matter is that lower margin product is larger in December than it was in September, unlike last year. And, then as far as IDP, yes, the IDP growth is going to help as far as mix but there's also mix within IDP. So when it all shakes out, the dominant factor here is the mix of mobile products, sequentially.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Capital.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Hi, guys. A question on China. You mentioned you're seeing more progress in BAW there. Is there a way to think about how much BAW or what's the penetration of BAW in the premium segment, Bob? And then are you still running into TC-SAW, SAW-based solutions there or are you seeing any of your BAW competitors also competing in that market?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. This is Eric. So there are some discrete BAW solutions which of course we are providing. So just to be clear, we didn't indicate that we were seeing an increase in BAW currently. What we are saying is we're forecasting when we return to the BAW penetration that was there last year, which was driven by carrier aggregation requiring quadplexers, which were primarily BAW-based, right? So if you go from a carrier aggregation requirement of about 15% in the market this year to 50% next year, that roughly triples the opportunity, let's say, for those BAWed quadplexers. And that's really the opportunity we're referring to.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I guess my question was more about the Huawei win that you mentioned, Eric, I'm guessing that has some BAW content in that. So I'm just curious if that's a new BAW design that you won against TC-SAW or if you're displacing the existing BAW suppliers out there?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, no, it's existing BAW bands.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Good evening. I just wanted to follow-up with some of the comments on BAW and capacity utilization. Perhaps you could talk about what you think would be the profile of the improvement utilization as you go through. And I know there is conviction in that utilization improving over a three-year period. What do you expect to be the profile of that? And, importantly what would be the driver of that? Eric, you had mentioned this potential for carrier aggregation on 15% of the TAM to 50% of the TAM. Is that something that you think is achievable over the next year?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, so I think the drivers of that are the carrier aggregation attach that we've talked about. Also Wi-Fi, we have the BAW in our coexistence filters for Wi-Fi. Some of these antenna plexers that I mentioned are BAW-based, as well. And then of course, it's the custom module that we're working on today that has a tremendous amount of BAW content in it. So there's several things that are going to layer in and, again, the trend is clear that the timing of each of those is a little harder to predict but there's clearly a trend towards layering on a lot of different opportunities in BAW.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And then, Chris, just as that BAW-enabled revenue increases and we've talked about before, we're less than 25% now. We're going to be closer to 30% next year and then that expands in the planning horizon. That loads Richardson, specifically, and then Farmers Branch. By mid next year, we would expect to be 80% or so loaded if our plans play out as expected. And then it becomes a case of just very carefully managing our CapEx. And as we need additional capacity, we're doing it in the most cost-effective way, which the wafer size increase, the die shrink, all these other things we believe will reduce the capital intensity of the business going forward.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just as a follow up to that, I think you said 80% number on your plans, does that contemplate BAW penetration at your largest customer or would that be additive to that?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","I'll just leave it, Chris, in order to get the utilization that we want, we're going to need BAW-based revenue without a doubt. And we also need to continue to do well in winning SAW-based business and GaAs-based PA products and other things. So we are absolutely focused on increasing our profitability with high-quality products.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on seasonality. Understand March quarter is better than seasonal because of the push out of the flagship customer. Do you think that the June quarter seasonality could be below seasonal because of the impact of that phone on the Korean customer launch every year?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","We're not giving March guidance. We're not going to give June guidance, for sure.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, Mark, I have a question on gross margins. I absolutely agree with Ambrish earlier that you guys have made a lot of progress in the gross margins but then you guys keep on running in new excursions, whether it's laminate supplier issues. What is it with your manufacturing process or is it complicated with BAW and SAW and everything? We don't hear about these issues from other RF makers. Maybe they're also having these issues but they're not talking about it on their call. But what is it about your manufacturing process that could help us get more comfortable with these excursions in the future?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, I think just very quickly there's an important distinction. Last year you could argue that it was something in our control. And we had a bad quarter, some manufacturing excursions and looked at ourselves and really cleaned up our processes and it's paid off. And we have been running much better. The ramps this year are going very well. And the two instance we mentioned here, in the interest of disclosure, wanted to make sure folks understood it, I would say these are out of our control. One is literally an act of God, the Hurricane Irma, where interestingly, in the days after the hurricane after the fab was back up and running, there were some defects associated with sulfur compounds on the wafer or on the wafers, on the metal layers of the wafers. And it turns out it was decaying vegetable matter and conventional fab air filtration wasn't sufficient.","And so we changed some very good root-cause analysis and recovery action by the team. Changed the filtering and then just natural dissipation, the problem went away and we did not impact the customer. That's the important thing. And then this fire at a laminate supplier, again, out of our control but what it speaks to is the good operational excellence on our part, had some qualified suppliers, we mobilized, worked with our customers, worked with these other qualified suppliers and as we see it, we're on track to have a minimal impact from this event.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. I wanted to come back to this opportunity on the mid- and high band with Apple and it looks like your competitor, at least in one of the versions of the current phone, is shipping. And so they've gone through all the processes and trials and sampling. So does that change at all your thinking in terms of what the prospects are as you go into next year?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Not at all.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And so on the IDP business, which is running 20%, can you talk about some of the sub-segments in that space in terms of where you see is driving the really robust growth?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes, as I talked earlier, our connectivity business was very strong with what we were able to do in Wi-Fi. And we had a great quarter in the defense business. Substantial growth really across all our major sub-markets: radar, EW, comms, and through our distribution channel there as well. So we had a broad section of customers. We also had nice growth in the IoT segment. And as you're aware, we're first in the industry to have SoCs that can operate at multiple standards. We are seeing great attach rate of those chips. We've been able to get some industry first awards.","Embedded Computing, as an example, gave us the Most Innovative Silicon Product of the year. So that's also created substantial growth. And we talked about greater than 50% growth in our IoT business. So been very broad-based. We also saw strength in small cell and NBIoT, as we talked about in Bob's script. We've been cautious about small cell for many years. It looks like this maybe is the breakout year in the small cell activity. And in India, IoT was also, we believe is starting a ramp that could last a couple years in China. So pretty broad-based, I guess I would say.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you for joining us tonight. Qorvo is leveraging our industry-leading product and technology portfolio to target the most valuable opportunities and the largest profit pools across our diverse growth markets. We thank you for joining us tonight, and we look forward to meeting with many of you at upcoming conferences. Good night, and thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Douglas Toledo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas Toledo","Thanks, very much, Rebecca. Hello, everyone and welcome to Qorvo\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today\u2019s release and on today\u2019s call we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide the supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com under Investors. In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up.","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo\u2019s Mobile Products Group and James Klein, President of Qorvo\u2019s Infrastructure and Defense Products Group as well as other members of Qorvo\u2019s management team.","And with that, I will hand the call over to Bob.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you, Doug. Qorvo delivered an exceptional December quarter, with revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance range. In infrastructure and defense, quarterly revenue grew 20% year-over-year to a record $203 million led by strength in defense, IoT and GaN. In mobile products, revenue increased sequentially to $642 million led by a very strong ramp in support of our largest customer. The December quarter played out largely as expected. IDP\u2019s business continued to strengthen, while smartphone ramps were consistent with our expectations.","Beginning late in the quarter, demand trends in mobile deteriorated at our largest customer and also in China. This weakness is impacting our near-term expectations and is reflected in our guidance for the March quarter. As we look forward, we expect continued robust growth in IDP in 2018 and in mobile we are gearing up for an aggressive ramp of a custom mid\/high-band PAD in the second half of the calendar year. This is the most valuable and highly integrated placement in mobile RF representing what we call the integration hub in the main path of the RF system. This is a significant customer validation of our BAW technology and multiplexing expertise. Coupled with gains in antenna tuning and envelope tracking we expect this to drive another generation of year-over-year growth with these top customers.","Across the mobile landscape, leading phone manufacturers and baseband suppliers are adopting more highly integrated mid\/high-band architectures. This is increasing the customer demand for high order BAW-based multiplexing from industry leaders like Qorvo and we are migrating a greater percentage of our design resources to higher volume BAW-based RF solutions. To that end, we have sampled a custom mid\/high-band PAD to another Tier 1 smart phone customer for our 2019 platform. In addition to these engagements with marquee customers, we have commenced production of our next-generation RF Fusion portfolio for Phase 6 architectures, including both mid\/high-band and low band integrated fab modules. This solution supports all major cellular frequency bands and more efficiently enables key regional carrier aggregation combinations. In both premium and performance to your smart phones, mobile products, is targeting the most valuable opportunities with the highest barriers to entry. Premium filters clearly fit within this category as do antenna tuners, envelope trackers, antenna plexers and our integrated mid\/high and low mid\/high solutions featuring our BAW filters.","In China, mobile operators are requiring improved data throughput across a larger percentage of smartphones this year. China Unicom and China Telecom recently mandated Band 1 and Band 3 downlink carrier aggregation and handsets above RMB 1,500 for the mass market for higher tier handsets that was greater than RMB 3,000, China Mobile recently mandated Band 40 and Band 41 downlink carrier aggregations. Phones with these features are expected to be available as early as the middle of this calendar year. Supporting our long-term outlook, we see a broad slate of new applications emerging in cellular IoT, which can support billions of incremental units. Qorvo recently announced the co-development of the industry\u2019s smallest low power system-in-package module with Nordic Semiconductor for global LTE-M and narrowband IoT applications. This opportunity includes the PA, switch, controller dye as well as model design and manufacturing, including our proprietary integrated RF shielding.","Finally, we now expect the first 5G smartphones will launch as early as the first half of calendar 2019. 5G will enable new used cases by expanding data throughput, reducing latency to near zero and enabling massive machine-to-machine connectivity. 5G will require more complex and more valuable RF solutions than 4G, continuing the ongoing expansion of the RF TAM. Qorvo is uniquely positioned to accelerate the transition to 5G. We offer the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio of RF products and we intend or reintroduced the industry\u2019s first 5G RF front-end nearly a year ago. We are helping to find 5G standards as a delegate to a 3G PC and we are collaborating closely with the leading wireless infrastructure manufacturers, network operators, chipset providers and smartphone manufacturers on their 5G programs. We are extremely pleased with what the mobile products team has done to deliver the industry\u2019s most valuable mid\/high RF placement. We validated our ability to capture the industry\u2019s most attractive RF placements and we have line of sight through expanding content on marquee smartphones.","Turning now to IDP, we are enjoying broad-based growth supported by the Internet of Things, the evolution of the wireless ecosystem, the deployment of GaN, the emergence of 5G and other secular macro trends. These are long-term trends capable of supporting continued above market growth. In fact, our design wins this quarter were up over 40% compared to the same quarter last year. In the connected car, IDP is supplying the front-end module for Qualcomm\u2019s cellular vehicle to everything reference design delivering superior performance to support low latency transmission in the 5.9 gigahertz intelligent transportation system band. We also secured a major win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier for a LTE network access device.","For the Smart Home ecosystem are forming around voice assistance and products that support multiple protocols are becoming the norm in the marketplace. Qorvo is the only company to support Thread, ZigBee 3.0, ZigBee RF4CE and ZigBee Green Power in a single radio. We are advancing this trend by meeting our multi-stock, multi-protocol system-in-package with the HUMAX Chorus Voice Assistant. In defense, from both domestic and international markets, electronic warfare and missile defense have become top of mind in the industry. IDP participates heavily in both applications and we are at the forefront of the technology shift to GaN-based phased array system architectures. Our GaN products and the Spatium high-power amplifier family continue to ramp. The focus on high-value sockets and technologies has resulted in greater than 50% year-over-year growth in our defense business.","In infrastructure, we are also helping the lead migration to GaN to improve the performance of LTE-based stations and small cells. As LTE moves to higher frequencies above 2.5 gigahertz, the incumbent technology of silicon LDMOS is unable to achieve the level of performance required. GaN is becoming the technology of choice for transmit amplifiers at all major base station OEMs. In Wi-Fi, CPE, the proliferation of distributed Wi-Fi networks coupled with the needs for more bandwidth is driving rapid growth in both consumer and enterprise solutions. And IDP is a primary beneficiary winning on both performance and integration.","Our broad portfolio of power amplifiers, front-end modules, switches, LNAs and filters continue to win and 802.11ac sockets and positions us well for the 802.11ax wave coming this year. Overall, IDP has delivered 9 out of 10 sequential growth quarters since we repositioned our portfolio to target defense, base station, automotive, smart home, IoT, Wi-Fi and optical markets. Our outlook for IDP is one of continued growth with the annualized revenue run-rate quickly moving towards $1 billion. In both mobile and IDP, our technology mode and rich product offerings enable us to target the most attractive opportunities as measured by the technologies required, competitive environment, value creation and other critical metrics.","We are delivering best-in-class products that help customers achieve higher levels of performance and we are targeting opportunities where we have a distinct advantage with both technology and scale. Calendar 2017 was an excellent year for IDP. In mobile, we made significant advances in the business in terms of technology, cost and portfolio management. As we look into calendar 2018, IDP is positioned for continued growth and margin expansion and mobile is set to support the industry\u2019s most valuable RF solutions.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. Qorvo\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $845 million exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $5 million. Mobile revenue of $642 million was driven by product launches at our largest customer. IDP revenue of $203 million reflects continued strength in defense, including advanced radars and other electronic warfare products and in connectivity including Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in IDP.","Non-GAAP gross margin in the December quarter was 48%, 50 basis points higher than our guidance, a sequential increase of 60 basis points and a year-over-year increase of 370 basis points. We expect continued progress on gross margins as we optimize our product portfolio and drive additional operational improvements. Operating expenses were $151 million or 17.9% of sales, down $7 million sequentially on ongoing productivity efforts and development program spend timing. We are ahead of schedule with OpEx reductions, but by no means are we letting up on our focus on getting more efficient. We have additional productivity initiatives underway to sharpen R&D spend and lower SG&A.","Operating income for the quarter, was $254 million or 30.1% of sales, up 200 basis points sequentially and 480 basis points versus last year. Last year, we committed to achieving quarter in fiscal year \u201818 with an operating margin exceeding 30% and we delivered on that commitment in the December quarter. This is a particularly noteworthy accomplishment when you consider that mobile volumes and fab utilization have fallen short of our expectations this fiscal year.","We are pleased that our broad-based efforts are yielding results and intend to continue our disciplined approach to controlling costs and improving margins. On net income, I will start with our GAAP results. In the December quarter, a GAAP loss of $33 million was impacted by tax expense resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, we incurred a $96 million net tax expense, which was largely the result of the immediate taxation of cumulative foreign earnings and which was partially offset by revaluing net deferred tax liabilities on a lower U.S. tax rate. I encourage you to review our forthcoming 10-Q filing for the additional disclosure on taxes.","Non-GAAP net income in the December quarter was $220 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.69 or $0.09 over the midpoint of our guidance. December cash flow from operations increased to $270 million helping to drive record free cash flow of $225 million. Capital expenditures decreased sequentially to near $45 million and we expect CapEx to end the full fiscal year below 10% of sales, down from 18% of sales last year. We are committed to a model of higher margins, lower capital intensity and greater free cash flow and we are demonstrating clear progress towards those objectives. Cash at quarter end was $841 million. And with recent tax legislation we can more freely deploy cash for investments in growth and repurchasing shares. In the December quarter we repurchased $80 million of stock.","Turning to our outlook, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $645 million and $665 million, gross margin to be flat to up 50 basis points sequentially and diluted EPS of $1.05 at the midpoint of our guidance. We expect a quarter of over 20% year-over-year growth in IDP and project IDP to be over 30% of quarter\u2019s revenue in the March quarter. For mobile, this guidance reflects our current view on near-term demand for our customers\u2019 flagship models. In the March quarter, we expect gross margins to increase sequentially by up to 50 basis points due primarily to reduce volumes of low band PADs and an increase mix of our higher margin IDP business. Operating expenses are forecast to increase slightly to approximately $153 million on development program spend and seasonal factors including payroll taxes.","Free cash flow is expected to be around $200 million. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rates to remain below 8.5%. Based on our outlook and our current interpretation on recent U.S. tax law changes, we project our fiscal year \u201819 non-GAAP tax rate to be 10% or lower. Our efforts to leverage our technology position and improve the operating performance of our business are paying off and we expect to sustain this progress. In fiscal year \u201819 we expect robust IDP growth to continue supported by trends in defense IoT and GaN. As Bob mentioned we are hitting key milestones to realign the mobile product portfolio from lower to higher margin products and securing design wins in the industry\u2019s most attractive segments.","We expect to see significant benefits from these efforts starting in the second half of this year \u2013 calendar year. As our product mix and overall fab utilization improve, we expect gross margins to continue to expand. We project significant improvements in utilization on our BAW fab in Richardson, our gas fabs and our China assembly and test factories. This will be partially offset by lower utilization rates in our SAW fabs as we migrate resources to bolster recent successes and future opportunities in BAW and more selectively compete for SAW-based opportunities. With a more focused product portfolio, restructuring efforts taking full effect and productivity remaining a priority, we also expect OpEx efficiency to improve further. We are on track to achieve the operating margin target we laid out at Investor Day last May of 33% by fiscal year \u201820. With more profitable growth in mobile and robust growth in IDP, expanding operating margins and lower levels of CapEx we are targeting free cash flow of $800 million in fiscal year \u201819.","So wrapping up in the third quarter, we posted another quarter above guidance and delivered strong operating leverage. While our near-term revenue outlook has been impacted by weaker demand signals from our largest customer end from China, we see gross margins improving up to 50 basis points and strong free cash flow in the March quarter. In fiscal year 2019, we expect our premium mobile products and continued strength in defense, IoT and GaN to support revenue growth, margin expansion and greater free cash flow in fiscal year \u201819.","With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Krysten Sciacca with Nomura\/Instinet.","Krysten Sciacca","Congratulations on the quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I just want to clarify one point in particular. So far for the super-PAD did you say that you are sampling at an additional marquee customer?","Bob Bruggeworth","As far as mid\/high band PAD as with one of the bullets in the press release as well, we did begin sampling another Tier 1 customer a well.","Krysten Sciacca","Okay, thank you. And then further ramp at your largest customer in the second half of calendar \u201818 do you expect those content gains to be let\u2019s say more or less than what you saw in this past ramp?","Eric Creviston","This is Eric. I will take that. We are currently projecting we will have the largest actual generation-over-generation content increase we have seen driven by many product categories and then we see tuning continuing to increase, envelope tracking as well as BAW-based product.","Krysten Sciacca","Great, thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Krysten.","Operator","And next we will hear from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson","This design win is a terrific result after a lot of effort. I guess the question is how should we really think about seasonality, I know it\u2019s difficult to provide out-quarter revenue guidance, but how should we think about seasonality beyond the March quarter with the second half in mind? Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes, Bill, at this point, we are not going to give guidance beyond the March quarter. I don\u2019t think we can make any changes yet about seasonality, because we haven\u2019t gotten customer demand signals yet and we are actually in our plan process at this moment. So we will provide more detail around both fiscal year \u201819 and about seasonality during the May call.","Bill Peterson","Okay. Let me try different angle, I guess, you mentioned that you expect the China Telecom\/Unicom lowering the price points as you should increase carrier aggregation, you talked about the middle of the year. I guess how should we think about tax rates of this and if we consider ETP tuning at ISMs in China, how should we think about your content growth opportunities in China I guess specifically this year?","Eric Creviston","Yes, this is Eric. I will take that as well. We look at the attach rate of the Band 1\/3 cloud plexer to enable carrier aggregation going from about 15% \u2013 maybe 15% to 20% as we exited CY17 up to about 50% attach rate based on the guidance of the carriers for any handset over RMB 1,500 to require the capability. So, that\u2019s such a pretty significant step up and gets us back to where we were frankly in 2016 with the attach of that component. And as we look forward as you mentioned, ET is moving into that tier where we are seeing a lot of design work with our customers for our Phase 6 solution. We are the first to market with that solution and ramping into production now. Phase 6 does several things for our customers. It increases the integration level, which speeds their time to market. It also reduces the size by at least 40% and in most cases about 50% of their current design and it increases the output power at the same time enabling Power Class 2. So, we do all of that in fewer placements by integrating the vast majority or in some cases all of the filter content into our two-placement solution that does all that for the front-end. So, we see that integration factor and the Phase 6 opportunity for us is being a very key content for us throughout this year.","Bill Peterson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","From Raymond James, Chris Caso.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. I guess the first question with regard to gross margins and the impact of utilization, given what you are expecting in China as well as the high\/mid PAD where do you think you get the utilization exiting this year of the BAW facilities and what impact does that have in the gross margin?","Mark Murphy","Are you talking this calendar year Chris or are you talking fiscal year?","Chris Caso","For the calendar year?","Mark Murphy","Yes. So we are not going to give specific guidance on gross margin not far out. I will make a few comments on gross margin. This will certainly help the Richardson fab in particular. But I will get to that in a moment. But our December quarter we were up again 50 basis points. So excluding the hurricane effects in the September quarter and we would be five out of our last five gross margin guidance. And if you look at our guides the five previous before five ago, we didn\u2019t do so well. So we have certainly \u2013 we have certainly become more predictable and that\u2019s the positive allowing us to get more productivity, better visibility and so forth. We have also had obviously steady progression on gross margin from what was the low in the second quarter of \u201817 of 42.8% to our current guide which is 48% to 48.5%. So we are really back at levels that we were back in fiscal year \u201816. So again undoubtedly we are getting better forecasting and we are clearly getting better on improving the business since we are up 500 basis points from trough to the midpoint of the current guide. All this has been an environment of weak volume, it\u2019s been with the low margin low band PAD and has been candidly in a company that was still working its way through a transition. So if we look where we have been and we think about the progress that we have made, we have great confidence about the gross margin as we look out. Fabs are running exceptionally well. We have got capacity available that we are going to fill. The fabs are competitive and ready for business. The technology investments we have made are allowing us to move into the markets that are most attractive and we are securing wins now. And then you have got a management team that\u2019s absolutely focused on gross margin and free cash flow and exhibiting the right behaviors. So the market of course Chris is going to dictate at the end short-term utilization of the fabs. But we do expect to at least in a quarter touch 50% in fiscal year \u201819, that\u2019s certainly what we are working through as we are building our plan now. And I am confident that we will certainly be above 49% for the year average. And that contemplates Richardson, our largest fab moving up over 80% utilization in the next 6 months as well as increased utilization in gas as I mentioned in my comments and over 80% utilization in our back end operations. The one headwind is what I mentioned during my prepared remarks about our SAW utilization going down. On average fab utilization should be a positive effect going into \u201819.","Chris Caso","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up question was actually going to be on SAW and if perhaps you could clarify some of those comments, I mean it sounds like that with the success in BAW there would be a less emphasis in SAW and that\u2019s understandable given the margin structure there, but as we get into the second half of the calendar year, should we expect SAW to actually be down year-on-year where would be some shift from SAW to BAW because of some of these in design engagements or is that just sort of less emphasis from a design win perspective going forward?","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes. Our current projection would indicate SAW will be down year-over-year in the second half. We are investing in a lot of key technologies in SAW which will help enable many different products that are coming, but with majority of those products that we are going to focus going forward on products that combined BAW with SAW to really make unique product offerings and leverage that asset further.","Chris Caso","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","From Longbow Research, Mike Burton.","Mike Burton","Hey, guys. Thanks and congrats on the design wins. First, I guess maybe for Eric, could you talk about the China market and maybe inventory levels at the end of 2017, you guys had been a relative gainer as you have got back on track at Huawei. What percent of sales were the China OEMs and how do you expect that to trend in Q1, obviously down, but we saw MediaTek this morning guiding for shipments down about 30%. I am wondering if you kind of subscribe to that sort of that level?","Eric Creviston","Yes. So, we are doing our best to maintain tight control of the channel inventories. And so we are following the volumes as they come. You see that in our guidance essentially. To answer your question specifically, in the December quarter, the China guys were roughly 20% of our revenue and that\u2019s of course lower than historically. And looking into March, we are consistent with our guide, we are following the directions and taking our judgment to their current plans and trying to make sure that first and foremost we keep the channel tight, so that whenever the end-market recovers we will see that demand immediately.","Mike Burton","Okay. And then maybe a two-parter for Mark, just the low band PAD trajectory obviously you have talked about it being down in Q1 and you\u2019ve spoken in the past about being able to migrate to \u2013 you are going to migrate to a new low-band PAD with in-source filters. When is the timing of that migration and can you help us size kind of the margin impact for that? And then also the second part is just the shape of CapEx and OpEx going forward, I am just curious if that\u2019s \u2013 if you can help us understand that relative to the high-band PAD win and also the potential for a new customer next year? Thanks.","Mark Murphy","Yes, on low-band PAD, I think all I will say in that is it we have continued to make improvements of the product. There have been some changes in the filter, slight filters required by the customer and that\u2019s helped a bit, but mostly it\u2019s just improved manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in that product over time. Yes, it\u2019s still a net drag on the business, so as it sort of tails off in the portfolio, yes, there is a positive mix effect associated with that and that helps us into margin going forward. As far as the outlook on CapEx, we are making great strides in becoming less capital intensive. We are doing everything we can to leverage the foundry network where we can and then where we have unique device requirements that require our own production. We are being very thoughtful about what we add and of course driving all the productivity programs you have heard before. And that\u2019s helped us achieve this lower CapEx profile as we see going forward. This year will be below 10% of sales CapEx. Next year, we think will probably be below 8% of sales on CapEx. And one example is we are going to be able to increase our BAW capacity 70% from current capacity to fiscal year \u201820 at only about $80 million of spend. So, a lot of positive things there on CapEx, which of course when you combine it with the growth we expect and the margin expansion we see a very strong free cash flow story. Again, we are in the midst of the planning process, Mike, so I am not going to give specific dollar guidance on OpEx, but what I will say is Bob and part of his productivity drive is really working the organization become more efficient on OpEx. And we have seen great progress this year as evidenced by this quarter actually, where we were at 17.9% of sales and really at a $600 million run-rate number. Now of course, you are not forecasting that, But what I will say that in \u2013 we are striving to build a plan that\u2019s certainly below 20% of sales on OpEx for not fiscal year \u201819.","Mike Burton","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Next we will hear from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line may be muted, please see.","Quinn Bolton","I am sorry can you hear me?","Operator","Yes.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thanks. Hi guys congratulations on the next December results, wanted to ask a question on your comments about SAW utilization dropping in the second half of calendar \u201818, a read into that that your low band patch share is declining, I mean is there a socket change going on the low band patch site that\u2019s behind that lower SAW utilization? And then I get a follow-up. Thanks.","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes. Quinn thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s best to say that our utilization is going down. Yes there is some percentage in share shifts in the low band PAD. I think what is important is that as Eric has already mentioned and I commented in my script that we are shifting our resources to what we believe is a more attractive profitable, but in the same time we still see plenty of opportunities to utilize the technologies that we developed in SAW where we can leverage both BAW and SAW. So I think that\u2019s the best way to answer that.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thanks Bob. And then just a question on Samsung, they tend to have a stronger March quarter obviously, you guys are guiding March down reflecting your largest customer and what you are seeing in China, just wondering if you could give us any sense as you look to the next marquee platform at your large screen customer, what do you see in terms of your content in that ramp as we look in the March?","Eric Creviston","Yes, this is Eric, I will address that and actually I will talk maybe Huawei at the same time. Throughout last year we had talked about we had gotten a little out of step with Samsung and as well as with Huawei. We began to turn the corner with Huawei in their fall flagship launch. I think that\u2019s clearly demonstrated now. We are also committing to increasing our content from each platform forward with Huawei. So we will have greater content in their spring lunch and even greater in next fall beyond that. So, we have begun the turn with Huawei, but we have also been clear that we don\u2019t expect that to be the case with Samsung in this launch. So the spring cycle for Samsung we are not expecting any growth in content, not expecting much help there. However, second half of this year both in the last year and in their second half flagship launch we do expect to turn the corner and start to see meaningful change in share and particularly large opportunities for Samsung. And in their spring next year launch we did mention we have sampled a second custom mid-high band PAD to know the marquee customers as an example. And I think James would love to talk about Samsung as well.","James Klein","Yes. I want to talk a little bit, Samsung is becoming a very strong customer for IDP and we mentioned in the press release how we have had a great design win with their remote controls, that\u2019s really with our of the ZigBee, so great win for that organization. And on top of that we are also starting do very well with their infrastructure business. So you are seeing us supply into things like their demonstrations that are going to go into the Olympics next month and also into other 5G trials.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on we have from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Mark, looking if I could touch on real quick, how should we be thinking about the margin improvement when it comes to your low band PAD over one of the old one, are you talking hundreds or thousands of bps or is there even a new one on the horizon in terms of production or has most of that being coming from peeling off of the old one. And then Eric you mentioned you called out ET a couple of times as an area of growth this year, is that just more OEMs adopting ET or spreading it to 4 months, are you starting to see or expecting to see some demand for more ET up from carrier aggregation in production this year? And if I could maybe James, 802.11ax appears to have some fits and starts in the handset side of the business on your side are you seeing this coming in size of next year or so, was it just beginning of where do you stand on the ax ramp? Thanks guys.","Mark Murphy","James and I will let James go first.","James Klein","Yes. We will go first on ax, so we are seeing that ramp I believe this year. We already have the products that are going out now. Standard is not released, but the products that are in development to support that standard are in development now. The pullout of the products that we released last year, were in support of start of the evolution towards that. So, we are doing very well in AC today and we think we are positioned very well for the 8x ramp is going to happen during this calendar year.","Eric Creviston","Yes. Regarding envelope tracking, the market there continues to be very exciting. It\u2019s enabling many things not just lower current consumption, but also higher output power in many markets as we talked about as you can imagine content increasing due to performance improvements, also the dual uplink when we get to that point will require additional envelope tracking content. So, we are seeing content increases with the OEMs and baseband partners we are working with now, but in addition to that, we are engaging quite meaningfully with the new baseband partners, which will add potential revenues this calendar year.","Mark Murphy","Yes, Ed, it\u2019s Mark. On the low band PAD between versions we have now there is between 5 and 10 points margin difference, but as we have said even the improved one is still well below the mobile average margin. And these low band PADs are going to become a less important part of the portfolio going forward. I think we are going to be as Eric said we have a very capable SAW design team outstanding technology. We have proven our ability to compete in the most difficult low band PAD placements and ramp at the highest volumes with the most difficult customers. So, it\u2019s not a case of not being able to do it, it\u2019s a case of where do we want to spend our time and it\u2019s really about for us with this confirmation of our technology on BAW ball as it relates to mid\/high band really focusing resources there. And I think it\u2019s important to note that our revenue mix over time is pretty dramatic and its helping us drive our margins as we look out. So, in this year, it will be less than 25% of mobile\u2019s portfolio will be BAW related revenue. Next year, fiscal year \u201819, we view that being over 30%, in fiscal year \u201820 it\u2019s over 40% and in fiscal year \u201821 it\u2019s nearly half the mobile business is around BAW related opportunities, some of which will require the SAW filter content as well. So, I think that\u2019s the story today as aggressive portfolio management.","Edward Snyder","Just a quick follow-up, I am a little confused, Mark, because the SAW comes out of Florida and that\u2019s not a BAW fab which you saw there. You started a SAW fab in North Carolina and all your BAW comes out of Richardson and then you got Farmers Branch as a backup. So, I know we will be talking about it\u2019s kind of an either\/or, so are you saying you are putting BAW capacity into Florida and what does that mean for Farmers Branch, because you haven\u2019t really started production there?","Mark Murphy","No, Ed. Just to be clear and try to make it clear in the comments, we will have our utilization and our SAW capacity will go down and it will be a headwind in fiscal year \u201819. That is what we are currently planning and we are \u2013 we will plan to fill the capacity that we have over time with more selective SAW opportunities.","Bob Bruggeworth","But to be clear, our BAW production will be in Richardson as well as Farmers Branch in the future.","Operator","And from Piper Jaffray, we will hear from Harsh Kumar.","Harsh Kumar","Yes, hey, guys. Great job on free cash flow on meeting your gross margin goals. Quick question, Bob, if I go back to the December quarter, could you give us a sense of magnitude of \u2013 sorry the March guide, can you give us a sense of magnitude between your largest customer and the ramp and all the public stuff there. That\u2019s been talked about in China, what were the factors? And then second question as my follow-up was the super PAD or the mid\/high PAD that you are talking about, is this additional TRAM, because there is some confusion about whether it\u2019s brand new content or it replaces some of the things, maybe you could just explain or shed some color on it and if you can maybe ASP if possible?","Bob Bruggeworth","Harsh, I want to make sure I understood your first question in our March guide, December results yet. Yes, I think it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s our largest customer along with China. There has been a lot of things in the press as you have already reported out there. I think we wanted to make sure as you understood how much it impacted us since many of our customers have reported, I think it\u2019s best we not get into a lot of details, but it\u2019s primarily our largest customer in China is why we are guiding down in March. IDP is flat to up slightly in the single-digits, but IDP is continuing to do well just like last quarter. Eric, you want to take the TAM question?","Eric Creviston","Yes. I\u2019ll try Harsh, not exactly sure how to answer the question, it\u2019s not brand new TAM for the market, it\u2019s a particular function within advanced smart phones that has grown pretty dramatically in terms of capability and content generation over generation and we believe it will continue. We mentioned calling it the integration hub. It\u2019s got essentially all of the main path mid and high-band functions within it and we see over time how it can grow and actually take over other mid and high-band functions, for example, in the diversity path. So, it\u2019s a great deal high-value, very high performance sort of heartbeat of the modem.","Harsh Kumar","Got it, thanks. Thank you.","Operator","From Bank of America, Vivek Arya.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question. What is the sustainability level of maintaining the socket in future years, because some of this content was with the different suppliers, now it\u2019s flipping over to you guys, what were the factors behind the win and then importantly what is the visibility in maintaining this content as you go out in time?","Bob Bruggeworth","Vivek, let me first say, it\u2019s nice that we are able to demonstrate the capabilities. Second, as you well know, not all funds are created equally and utilized the same architectures. So, I want to take a little bit issue with you on that. What I can say is yes, we are working on future generations and more importantly we are also working on these opportunities at other customers. So, I do believe we are at the beginning of the growth here. I think as we said all along when it was just a single BAW filter or few BAW filters in a module, we were able to compete when things got to higher order multiplexing, yes, we were behind and we talked over the last several quarters about how we have to first improve the resonator improvement performance, then work on how we can design multiplexers and then how we can put multiple multiplexers in a module along with PAs and switches what have you. I think what\u2019s important is we now have demonstrated that capability. We are in the game and it\u2019s our belief that we are going to be able to continue for multiple generations and more importantly of multiple customers.","Vivek Arya","Got it. Very helpful, Bob. And as my follow-up if you look back at the low band PAD example, there were some initial growing pain from manufacturing and a gross margin perspective. Obviously, this is a very different product, but I am just curious to know, what\u2019s your level of confidence in yield and margins as I imagine this is a significantly more complex product than low-band PAD?","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes, fair point. I mean, it is a very complex product. However, the process itself has been very well rung out as you can imagine. We did have a very high volume ramp of the high-intensity BAW content product a couple of years ago that went incredibly smoothly and very, very well. So far, our 8-inch wafers in BAW are yielding at least as good as the 6-inch ones were. The entire manufacturing line seems to be running very well. We are already running quite high volume samples of the product to prove out manufacturing variances with credit quality issues and so forth. So, we are doing everything we can to assure smooth ramp. There is no recent belief it won\u2019t go very well.","Vivek Arya","Got it, thanks and congratulations on these sockets.","Bob Bruggeworth","Thank you.","Eric Creviston","Thanks, Vivek.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Just following up on the comments of Huawei in the fall in terms of regaining some momentum, any thoughts as you kind of transitioned into the spring in terms of do you see carry through there or how are you thinking about Huawei for 2018?","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes. I mentioned earlier that we turned the corner on the fall 2017 flagship. We have clear visibility into increasing content on the spring flagship launch. And we are very excited about the engagement so far for the next fall flagship launch, but we believe we have the capability of significant share gains there as well.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, thanks. And then just a follow-up on the super PAD just given the confidence in terms of the ramp in the second half, is there anyway for you to gauge in terms of relative spread of that business for you versus what\u2019s available or any of the context in terms of how you viewed the opportunity into the back half?","Eric Creviston","It\u2019s a great opportunity. It\u2019s not many people are able to pull off this way of sophistication and this level of performance and be able to manufacture in high volume and high yields. I think we are seeing a lot of customer for this type of product. Now that we have demonstrated the performance ability and going forward, I think just to add to what Bob said earlier, we see a lot of reasons and ways for us to differentiate the capability as power levels go up. We have a lot of power handling capability in our filter technology and so we are well aligned I think with the future architectures.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then I am sorry if I could just slip one more in, in terms of how you will get the percentage of customers, so for the December quarter what\u2019s your largest custom in any of the 10%?","Bob Bruggeworth","There is one 10% customer, Craig.","Operator","And the next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the win. You guys talked about design wins and IDP being up 40% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you maybe provide some color there if you could point to one or two or three key contributors there from an end market or end product perspective that will be helpful? Then I have a follow-up.","Bob Bruggeworth","Okay, thanks. So as you said really strong design win again this quarter, 40% year-over-year and really the same story is our revenue growth led by defense and IoT, strong design wins combined with the funnel really gives us pretty bullish outlook for the business for future growth. Couple of specific examples, are things that we talked about in the press release you saw our design win with Samsung on TVs and so that\u2019s a nice future growth prospect for our low-power wireless business. And then we have also had a string of nice design wins inside the Wi-Fi business as well.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thank you. And then the second one is for Mark, clearly, you guys are doing a great job in improving free cash flow here and going forward, how should we think about capital allocation over the next couple of years in terms of how you guys prioritize investments versus capital return and perhaps M&A? Thank you.","Mark Murphy","Yes, you are right. As evidenced in the December quarter, the guide in March and then the outlook for \u201818 is the free cash flow generation has been very strong and we expect it to continue. We have been clear that we intend to maintain a 1.5x debt to EBITDA ratio. So, we are currently fine there. We are actually under that. So, no need to pay down debt possibly take-out the 23 notes in this calendar year for some lower cost financing, but other than that, we would like to sustain those levels of leverage. So with that and with the greater flexibility on cash, with the new tax law, we have got both significant balance sheet flexibility and capacity. We have been clear that our first priority is to invest in the business, which we have been doing. And we believe we are going to be a lot less capital intensive going forward. So, that frees up even more of its operating cash flow to be fall down into free cash flow and then we will look at M&A activity. And I am really excited about what James has done with the IDP business, lot of growth factors in that business, so certainly keen on bolt-ons that are where we are focused and so always looking at opportunities in James\u2019 business to bulk up and diversify core of overall. And then to the extent, our leverage is okay and there is no immediate acquisition, then we will return cash to shareholders.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Operator","From Citigroup, Atif Malik.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question. If I look at the American smartphone maker, the number of models or SKUs, they are putting out are doubling this year from our 4 models versus 2 last year. So when I look at your content being up over last year, this year how should we think about the unit impact that they are more models and from the volume diversification and maybe you can help out just providing the top line growth expectations for this year and I have a follow-up?","Bob Bruggeworth","I am really sorry, but any future predictions that our largest customer architectures number of phones etcetera. I am sorry we are going to stay away from that. I am sorry we can\u2019t help you with that, maybe you can ask them tomorrow.","Atif Malik","Sure. Just RF top line growth the market growth 10% to 15%, are you expecting your top line to outperform?","Mark Murphy","Yes. We are still looking at the long-term RF market as 10% to 15% opportunity in mobile due to all the drivers that we have spoken about many times, really driven by the demand for mobile data. So we are thinking this calendar year obviously off to bit of a slow start and I think closer to the low end of that in terms of total market. And in terms of our own growth we are committed to growing at or ahead of our market while expanding gross margin and really focusing on cash flow as we go.","Atif Malik","Great and then follow-up.","Mark Murphy","I am going to jump in for IDP, so we will have another 20% growth year as we close out FY \u201818 with strength in IoT and defense. Again, we are going to stay focused on our high growth markets. We model those underlying markets to grow at an average of 10% to 15% as well. And I expect it will grow at or greater than those growth rates.","Atif Malik","Great. And then the follow-up, I mean Qualcomm has announced a memorandum of understanding with a major Chinese smartphone manufacturers Oppo and Vivo on the RF front and can you just talk about the impact of this on your China opportunity? Thank you.","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes. We don\u2019t see any obvious impact certainly nothing immediate and obviously Qualcomm is already a supplier into that market with various filters and ET and so forth. So like we understand the motivation for the announcement, we don\u2019t think it necessarily has any implications on us.","Operator","And next we will hear from Blayne Curtis of Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to ask you on this mid\/high band PAD, just if you can just walk us through when this got determined and then just try to get your visibility give a very specific free cash flow number, just if you can think about any sensitivities to that, obviously and other generations mix is mattered in such, kind of just any indications of what your visibility is and what the put factors could be in terms of what that and when could be?","Bob Bruggeworth","Yes. I don\u2019t think we can really give any more detail around the mid\/high band PAD other than just say we are progressing forward. It\u2019s on track. The team has done just a fantastic job developing an incredibly competitive product and we can\u2019t really get into anymore detail.","Blayne Curtis","And then just I wanted to go back to gross margin and BAW utilization, it\u2019s a nice result to see gross margin up a little with the top line coming down, are you starting to build filters ahead of this win for the second half?","Bob Bruggeworth","No Blayne, we are not. We will be soon not now.","Blayne Curtis","Okay.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Bob Bruggeworth","I want to thank everyone for attending tonight\u2019s call.

Q2 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much, Robbie. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings statement published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website at qorvo.com, under Investors.","In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question and a follow-up. Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings call. Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided August 2, reflecting broad-based demand.","Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 43%. Within the quarter, we experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields during a steep product ramp to a large customer. To protect our long-term customer relationships, we did everything we could to assure supply of high quality material to the customer while working through the internal yield issues, and this significantly impacted our gross margin.","Operating expenses were $172.9 million, in line with our goal of 20% of sales. On the bottom line, earnings were $1.29 per share, an increase of 19% versus our prior quarter. Mark will walk you through additional details in a moment and provide a bridge to our margin expectations. In the meantime, I'll update you on some other major initiatives currently underway.","During the September quarter, we brought up and released our TC-SAW process in Greensboro, ahead of schedule, giving us the ability to support additional customer demand this quarter. We are increasing the mix of 6-inch TC-SAW in Florida while moving all gas capacity to Oregon, transitioning all GaN products to Richardson. We're also ramping our new assembly and test facility into Dezhou, China.","In Richardson, the organization has done an outstanding job, releasing our most advanced next generation BAW process, which delivers a significant improvement over our prior generation in key performance metrics. We've also brought up and are now designing products on our new 8-inch BAW line in Richardson. We are enjoying broad-based demand for BAW filter solutions and we expect the ramp of new customer programs to improve our utilization rates in calendar 2017.","Notably, we continue to enjoy strong demand for our BAW-based multiplexer solutions and we have delivered module prototypes containing our BAW-based hexaplexers.","Looking at quarterly performance by segment, Mobile Products grew approximately 22% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to a record $706 million. Mobile Products supported the launch of highly popular, premium tier smartphones. And in the performance tier smartphones, we enjoyed strong demand for our RF Flex solutions. In Wi-Fi for handsets, Qorvo's RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi delivered customers a unique, highly integrated solution combining our high performance BAW filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules.","In China, Mobile Products is benefiting as smartphone manufacturers migrate from three-mode to full-mode devices. By the end of this year, we expect more than half of all 4G smartphones manufactured for the China market will be full-mode. Our largest customers in China are looking for ways to introduce fewer models with higher levels of RF content to provide broader coverage of additional geographies as they move towards more of an export market.","Huawei stands out as an excellent example. They are adding more RF content to their smartphones as they build their global brand. Huawei was one of two 10% customers for Qorvo in our fiscal second quarter and they are our largest customer in China.","Finally, the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and the upcoming deployment of 5G favor our unique combination of competitive strengths. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, envelope trackers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system level expertise to supply a complete portfolio of highly integrated solutions.","Looking at IDP, revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $158 million as our focus on higher growth segments continue to bear fruit. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP, in particular the revenue growth, the initiatives to target faster growing market segments, and the rate and pace of new product introductions.","IDP has enjoyed a series of very strong quarters and is closing in on its margin model of 60% gross margin and 30% operating margin. IDP is a recognized global leader with a product and technology leadership strategy that leverages internally developed, best-in-class technologies to provide our customers with differentiated performance solutions.","IDP is highly diversified and competes in a $3.8 billion serviceable market that's forecast by industry analysts to grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, nearly doubling to $7 billion by 2020.","In September, IDP released 49 new products including power amplifiers for small cell, dual and quad linear drivers for optical applications, LNAs, and filters for automotive and integrated front-end modules for Wi-Fi.","The continued aggressive pace of product releases is creating a broad-based pipeline of differentiated solutions with long production tails across our portfolio of markets. IDP's strong performance last quarter was across all major market segments, highlighted by growth in wireless infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense & Aerospace, as well as the IoT.","We've seen a continued recovery in the base station market and we enjoy broad-based market share across all OEMs. This helps buffer IDP from the ups and downs experienced by any one customer. Our view on the overall base station market is cautiously optimistic. We are continuing our focus on the markets' higher growth segments with an emphasis on the transition of base station power amplifiers to GaN technology and the implementation of massive MIMO.","In connectivity, IDP enjoyed growth in both Wi-Fi and low power wireless. With the acquisition of GreenPeak, Qorvo is a recognized leader at ultra-low power short range RF communications. We are expanding our low power product portfolio to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and the Internet of Things, and our target markets are growing faster than 40%.","In Wi-Fi, our growth was supported by continued wins in both the retail and set-top-box market segments. In transport, growth was driven by strength in our cable TV products to support the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, our traditional long-haul optical driver business and ramping data center interconnect products.","Qorvo's transport business is at the forefront of the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for data, and we continue to see an expanding set of opportunities.","In Defense, our growth was driven by international and domestic GaN on silicon carbide sales and a major ASIC program ramping. Design wins for our GaN on silicon carbide devices have been exceptionally strong in the market segments that are growing at over 25% per year.","In summary, the Qorvo team did an excellent job delivering 22% year-over-year growth and achieving our goal of operating expenses at 20% of sales. At the same time, we made progress advancing core technologies and developing highly integrated Qorvo solutions for large customer opportunities in 2017 and 2018.","It's clear, we have work to do on our gross margin and we're taking steps to address it. We continue to drive toward our operating model including above revenue growth and operating income above 30%.","Now, before turning the call over to Mark, let's view our achievements and our comments today through the prism of Qorvo's long-term strategy. Qorvo's growth strategy is based on three core principles. First, leverage our differentiated technologies and product leadership to achieve operational excellence, capture value, and deliver superior financial results.","Second, drive the integration of our two predecessor companies to achieve as Qorvo what neither could achieve alone.","Third, prioritize the use of cash on investments that grow our business, return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and supplement growth in IDP through M&A.","Our long-term view of the RF industry envisions more modes, more bands, more complexity and more RF, all driven by the ever-increasing demand for data and the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand.","In Mobile Products, only Qorvo can deliver a complete suite of multi-mode, multi-band solutions, combining premium BAW and temp-comp SAW filters, SAW filters, broadband power amplifiers, high probe count switches, high performance LNAs, envelope trackers and antenna control solutions. And Qorvo is the only industry participant positioning itself to supply internally developed, internally manufactured, and internally assembled system level solutions serving all major cellular frequencies.","We see growing demand for low, mid, and high frequency RF solution sales in the performance tier, as new cellular bands limit board space and pressure our customers' product development cycles. In the premium tier, we anticipate demand from multiple customers for highly compact, single placement solutions combining coverage of mid and high frequencies. To be clear, this will require more TC-SAW and BAW, a distinct advantage for Qorvo.","At IDP, our investments in internally developed best-in-class technologies, our sharpened focus on higher margin, higher growth markets and our introduction of hundreds of new products annually are combining to support excellent growth opportunities. These opportunities are underpinned by large secular trends extending into the foreseeable future. They include high speed connectivity, the Internet of Things, the connected car, data centers, and the proliferation of phased array technology. In wireless infrastructure, cable TV and defense applications, we expect our GaN technology to be increasingly disruptive.","So, from a high level, Qorvo has assembled the technology, products, people and resources to deliver best-in-class, highly integrated systems level solutions. We are investing in highly differentiated internally sourced technologies, best-in-class products, adding manufacturing capacity to keep pace with customer demand, and we are leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to drive above-market growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF content growth, the ramp of a key customer product, and strong Asia customer demand.","Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue increased 5% sequentially, and 22% year-over-year to $158 million on higher wireless infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense & Aerospace and IoT. We believe Qorvo is well positioned to continue to outpace the market growth due to our strong technology position, comprehensive product portfolio, and broad supply capabilities.","Gross margin was near 43% and most negatively impacted by manufacturing yield issues on our highest volume part in the quarter. Manufacturing yield issues on this part, a low-band PAD module, were related to soft filters from a single fab.","The impact was contained within Qorvo and yields have stabilized in the fab, which will help support even stronger customer demand for that module in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we do expect margins to improve on more stable production, however, higher mix of the low-band PAD will partially offset the improvement.","Operating expenses were at our target 20% of sales or $173 million. During the quarter, we had higher expenses to support ongoing development programs, higher sales commissions, and the full quarter effects of our GreenPeak acquisition.","Operating income for the quarter was approximately $197 million, with margins negatively impacted by the gross margin effects discussed. Non-GAAP net income was $170 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.29.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash increased to $469 million. Cash flow from operations was $250 million on income growth and efficient working capital management, particularly inventories.","Capital expenditures of $120 million are largely addressing growing premium filter demand through SAW investments in North Carolina and BAW investments in Texas. We yielded $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased $91 million of shares and today, we announced the approval of a new $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to commence buying under this program when our window opens as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.","Now, let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the December quarter: quarterly revenue between $800 million and $840 million; sequential gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 200 basis points; diluted EPS between $1.15 and $1.35; tax rate of approximately 8%.","Our December quarter guidance reflects continued strong demand with projected year-over-year sales growth over 30%. We currently expect gross margins to improve from the second quarter and through the second half of the fiscal year 2017, as our mix of low-band PAD peaks in the third quarter and our operations stabilize.","We expect OpEx to remain near 20% of sales in the third quarter and trend down in dollars through the rest of the fiscal year on lower commissions and an increase in productivity initiatives. CapEx will remain elevated through the rest of the fiscal year, as we invest in premium filter capacity to support forecasted customer demand.","As I close out my first quarter at Qorvo, I'd like to share my initial observations on the company and provide a longer-term outlook on the business. I believe Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to address rapidly growing RF demand and the design and production challenges posed by growing RF module complexity.","Qorvo has the key technologies, best-in-class design resources, advanced production capabilities and high quality employees to succeed. While the company has all the pieces to deliver extraordinary shareholder value, we have to improve our execution to reach this potential.","The integration has gone well in many ways, validated our vision for the combined company and yielded a common culture and synergies. But there is more that can be done on both the integration and general productivity. For example, this past quarter was the first full quarter in which most of the company was on a common ERP system.","Going forward, we expect that improved visibility, increased financial discipline and rigor, and a broad-based commitment to operational excellence will help drive additional synergies and improve our financial performance.","I'm enthusiastic about Qorvo's future and pleased to be able to contribute to efforts to improve the operating discipline and efficiency of the company. Within six quarters we expect to be at our targeted operating performance. We currently expect double-digit sales growth to continue through fiscal 2018 and forecast over 30% operating margins by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.","The Mobile Products segment is projected to benefit from continued content growth and demand for more complex modules using our premium filters. Our Infrastructure and Defense Products segment has been repositioned to serve higher growth markets including Wi-Fi, automotive, IoT, and wireless infrastructure. Looking forward through Fiscal Year 2018 we expect IDP's growth to be in line with Mobile Products.","For the rest of this fiscal year we expect our margins will improve as operations stabilize and low-band PAD mix declines. We expect to exit fiscal year 2017 above 46% gross margins and we believe that additional yield improvements, factory loading, sourcing and other productivity initiatives will help drive margin expansion in fiscal year 2018.","Factory yield improvements from process maturity and larger wafer production in SAW and BAW are expected to add approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in fiscal year 2018. Higher volumes are projected to add over 150 basis points of margin based on higher utilization of our BAW, SAW, and gas lines as well as ramping our new Dezhou assembly and test facility. Next year, considering projected volumes and the impacts of consolidation efforts and measured capacity additions, we expect our global operations to be running near capacity.","Finally, we projected ongoing supply chain consolidation and procurement initiatives along with additional efforts to wring out merger savings should drive another 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. Together, by the end of fiscal year 2018, we expect these efforts and a more favorable mix of higher margin products should result in greater than 50% gross margins. In fiscal year 2018, our OpEx is expected to grow at no more than half the rate of sales which will drive OpEx to under 20% of sales.","The operating model Bob mentioned is intact. It's a focus and imperative for our business team, and a goal we expect to achieve. We plan to exit fiscal year 2018 at over 50% gross margins, OpEx below 20% of sales and operating margins over 30%. Achieving this performance will generate substantial free cash flow, which we plan to use for acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much and I do appreciate the color, the longer term trajectory that you're providing. But just near term, I just wanted to focus on the gross margin. You have a gross profit \u2013 if I look at what you've guided to versus what you reported, it seems like a negative impact from higher revenues. Am I reading that correct that this is a negative margin business that you're winning incrementally? And then I had a follow-up.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, Ambrish it's \u2013 this is Mark. So, it's a mix issue. So, if you look at what we reported in second quarter, we reported roughly 43% gross margin. We pick up more than 200 basis points related to the yield issues that we had on our largest runner.","We pick up another, less than 100 basis points, but more inventory and yield related issues on smaller products. Now we lose 100 basis points related to higher volumes of a lower margin product mix, especially the one part. And that's increasing to about 1.5 times the percent of our business mix that it was in the second quarter.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And so my quick follow-up then is related to your guide. I'm not sure if I caught it correct, that improvement that you're seeing in the current quarter, is that \u2013 and the margin, is that from the high volume customer being down sequentially or is there a structural improvement in your gross margin?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","It's a structural improvement.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So that customer will still be up Q-over-Q, right?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Strong business.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I will cede the floor. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Vinay calling in for Craig. I wanted to go back on gross margins, right. You're calling for 150 bps of sequential improvement and continued improvement going forward, right. Like, just want to figure out what line of visibility do you have there, and in terms of the various actions you will take because I understand the mix perspective, but what confidence do you have that the yield issue that you faced last quarter will be behind you as we go forward?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Mark again.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Sure.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","So we have very good visibility. So the walk I did initially walks to 200 basis points sequential improvement, combination of a better yield in the third quarter, fewer associated inventory write-offs, and then we lose some ground related to the higher volume associated with the lower margin part, so just a mix issue.","So that's a 200 basis point sequential improvement. We gave a range of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to deal with the fact that, listen, we're doing record volumes and we want to make sure that we meet our commitments and we have good line of sight to what the midpoint would be, 150 basis points.","As far as the longer term view, we've done a great deal of work to walk back up to margins that we used to be and how are we going to get there? And as we've pointed out in several calls including today, we have a large number of initiatives under way which begin to bear fruit \u2013 well, they've benefited us recently, but they continue to bear fruit through 2018 as our facilities are more mature, as they're fully loaded and our product mix turns over to higher value parts. So we feel confident in the business model and our gross margin objective in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Got it. That's helpful. For a follow-up, wanted to talk about China smartphones as a group, right. Like you talked about the long-term confidence in that region with more phones being full mode, that's helping you guys with the long term. But can you just talk about some of the trends that you saw in September? Did that group grow in September, and what are your expectations for China smartphones in December?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Eric. I'll take that.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Sure.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","We did have yet another fantastic quarter of growth with our China-based customer set. Of course Huawei was a 10% customer for the company, but beyond Huawei, as well with Oppo and Vivo and many others in China, we did benefit from the trend of higher dollar content in the RF. We are expecting exiting the year that over half the phones consumed in China will now be full mode phones. We're also seeing many of our customers looking to export and reducing their SKU count, which of course those two things together drive up our content further as we look into next year.","So for the December quarter, specifically to your question, we're remaining cautious on China and being careful for any inventory pockets that might be out there. We see some customer-specific issues, but our products are used across all of our sets. So we expect to work through that in December and then back to growth next year.","Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.","Got it, very helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks a lot. A couple of questions here. Eric, have you identified the problem with the TC-SAW filter and has it been corrected? I understand you can't correct it real-time because you're in production with your largest customer. But if they were to say to you, hey, we'll take a break, we can recall this part, would your yields on that part snap back to more traditional levels?","And then maybe, if you could walk us through the bigger picture, Bob. You guys were at over 50% gross margins a couple times in the last 18 months or so, and it seems have lost the recipe, besides the TC-SAW part and low-band PAD and all that, I mean it was coming on, lowering \u2013 it was dropping before then. What are the problems that you face since that time that are causing you such angst in the margin profile outside of the yield issues, and what is it going to take to get back on track? Thanks.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Okay, Ed. I'll start with the issues. So we did identify the fact that our yield was lower than expected. To go a little deeper than that, it's specific to the die-level yield within the SAW and TC-SAW manufacturing process. I should be clear it's not related to a design issue. In fact it's not even related to the filter resonators themselves. It's really contained within the die singulation process and wafer level packaging.","The fact is we had a very steep ramp, the volume was heavily loaded towards the back of the quarter. Our die-level screens that we have in place in the factory did not catch the issue and so we found it once we had assembled the modules completely and were well into production. Our top priority of course was protecting our customers' lines. We made sure that they had good material; it resulted in a great many modules that needed to be scrapped at the finished good level.","However, by now we have produced, as you can imagine, tens of millions of the part. We understand the problem very well. We now have new die-level screens which are targeting the issue and working effectively. So, I think it's behind us.","To your point, we can't make changes in the actual manufacturing process now that we're in production, we do have some ability to make incremental improvements from here which we're going to do. But products that we release from this point forward will have improved manufacturing process and not be subject to this yield at all.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And Ed to your second question, getting back to the 50% gross margin, longer-term, Mark clearly walked you through all that. But if you kind of look at what's been going on in our factories, we have our BAW factory full and then we have our SAW factory full, and then we have our BAW factory full, and then we have our SAW factory full. So, we talked last quarter about our BAW factory was way under-loaded from optimum and that is \u2013 a large part as you know, Ed, it's a very good margin product family and quite honestly we missed that. And we also talked last quarter that some of our initial multiplexers weren't yielding real well and that's still in that mix but we're committed to get back to the 50-plus percent. IDP continues to do extremely well. The balance of the Mobile portfolio outside of this one product family does extremely well and we've got one area we got to go to work on.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","So, I mean, it looks like the revenue profile from all of our checks and what you said and everybody else says looks excellent for all the RF semi companies in terms of the business that you're chasing now. I know you guys are busy to get out to Skyworks, so is Avago. But I guess the big question, Bob, is the loading on the BAW factory dropped. You have been expanding it even recently in anticipation of better utilization and content wins next year. How can you be sure that you aren't making the same mistake this time that was made when you expanded capacity and didn't get the business last time?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","But, well, clearly, Ian, we've got a lot more learning as the companies come together and I think if you look at our top line and what we've done already, just the second half, in driving the growth, our product execution has significantly improved. We're making great progress. I think also you're starting to see the market for BAW based products to expand much greater than just one customer so the risk that we look at whenever we make this investment is actually going down over time because we have a larger customer base to sell BAW based products.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, can you maybe share with us your preliminary expectations for content growth going into 2017 at your U.S., Korean and Chinese customers? Should we take history as a guide for next year and assume content growth in the teens or are there inflections you need to 2017 that could lead to a potential acceleration?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So for the Mobile side, I'll say that we see a continuation really on a relatively consistent slope if you will, more in the 10% to15% range in terms of just the overall TAM growth and that is completely driven by content growth. We are not counting on unit growth at all. And so it's a continuation of the thing that we've been seeing this year, no real discontinuities.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Let me talk \u2013 I'm going to jump in and talk a little bit about IDP growth. There's exciting things really going on in several of our key markets over the past year or so. We've positioned the business to take care of some of those trends. Trends like connected car, connected home, the proliferation of phased arrays or Massive MIMO, and the development of 5G.","So as an example GaN has been a great growth story for us. Our capabilities have allowed us to capture key markets. Things like DOCSIS 3.1 for cable TV and base stations where they're moving the broader bandwidths and higher frequencies.","Also, another area for us is IoT, particularly the connected home. Our system-on-a-chip capability brings some real advantages to our customers. We offer benefits in multi-protocol, power consumption and range and in the next few years this will be a $1.5 billion market for us.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then as my follow-up, I had a question on M&A. You've talked about M&A in the past and specifically your focus on the IDP side of the business. Just wanted to confirm if M&A is still a focus for you guys, and if you can remind us what conditions you would look for in an asset or a business as you filter through potential deals, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Toshi, and a couple things. One is, Mark said in his comments as we generate cash M&A is absolutely one of the areas that we look to put that to work. Last quarter we talked about the acquisition we made with GreenPeak for the low-power wireless and that fit a lot of the criteria that we use when we look at an acquisition: number one, high growth; number two, good margin profile; number three, a nice market to help diversify our business in the fast-growing market of the IoT.","So we are willing to have M&A activities on smaller companies that are tuck-ins that we believe we can grow and scale given our own ability to grow and scale. Obviously, another area that we look at are technologies that we might want to tuck-in in either the Mobile business or IDP that we can then leverage.","So, but getting far abreast of the RF field currently is not in our interest. We think we're in great markets that are growing, the semiconductor industry in general was slowing for as far as we can see three to five years out, this will be one of the fastest if not the fastest segments of growth for the semiconductor industry. We have to continue to improve our execution and our productivity as Mark pointed out, but we think we're in a great place.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. I just want to clarify something you said earlier. Your largest customer will be up in December, and if that's the case I'm just curious if you could provide us some color on what is affecting the December guidance that we just had slightly $40-something million down, curious, any color on that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Harsh, last quarter we explained to the group that we were \u2013 I know some were surprised at our guidance and we said we were still taking a conservative stance in particular on China, and we saw tremendous upside from China during the quarter, which is why we exceeded our revenue guidance, so we're taking in general for our Asia customers a conservative view and we're expecting them to be down significantly quarter-over-quarter. We are expecting IDP to be flat to up slightly but the majority of that drop is with our Asian customers.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Have you seen that in the orders or is that just your conservative viewpoint? And then as my follow-up, I think your CFO gave the peak of the yield issue as I think the December quarter from what I understand. Now I know your largest customer revenues will come down in March seasonally. How should we think of that interplay between margins and revenues falling off as we go forward from December quarter?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks Harsh. Mark will take the gross margin. As far as your question on orders, typically in Asia, we see strength in the beginning of the quarter and then it drops off as we head towards Chinese New Year. So we're taking conservative view. We'll see. These customers are not very good at giving great forecasts and usually within lead time. So we're not \"fully booked\" for the quarter, but I think we did the right thing in assuming that business was going to be down.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","That's fair.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, and Harsh, it's Mark. So you'll see the reverse of the effect on the mix that you see in the third quarter. You'll see the reverse of that in the fourth quarter, so again, the improved yields that we see in the third quarter are partially offset by this mix drag on the higher volume of that low-band PAD, as that low-band PAD decreases in the fourth quarter, we'll see 100 basis point to 200 basis point margin lift from that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my questions, and thanks for the detail on the margin expectations. Bob just mentioned the multiplexer yield issues. Did I hear you correct that those yields are now up or satisfactory and is that part above or below corporate now and should it be going forward when it is at satisfactory yields?","2930 : This is Eric. I'll take that, Mike. So, yeah, multiplexer yields are back up where they should be. Margins on that product are roughly at our average right now. We've got newer products coming out up for new multiplexers early next year on our new BAW process with significantly better performance. We would expect those to be accretive to our standard margin.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Okay, great. And then definitely early here, but as we look forward to the March quarter, can you remind us just kind of some of the seasonality for Qorvo now, I mean especially after, with GreenPeak and some of the changes in the model. How should we be thinking about on initial basis seasonality for Qorvo, and any color that you might want to add to that, Bob? Thanks","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you. From an IDP perspective typically, roughly flattish going into that March quarter, a little too soon for us to call, but usually it's typically around flat. But as you notice when you look at what's transpired over the last few years, Q1 for the Mobile business is usually down pretty significantly and it's been trending much closer to 15% primarily as our largest customer ramps down significantly and it all depends on the timing of one of our other Asian customer's ramps, but I think it could be 15% in Mobile definitely.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, and thanks for taking the questions and thanks for providing the gross margin walk. Actually, first one for James. Can you level, set us on the size of the GaN business now in terms of let's say an annual run rate, I mean where this could go in let's say the balance of the year, in fiscal 2018?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Let me give you a couple of data points, let's first talk about base station. We see in the next three or four years probably 50% of the slots being GaN based so you guys can and look at what that market size is but that's a very large opportunity for us.","We continue to put investment dollars in there, focus for us is really performance and trying to drive cost out. As you know, we're on GaN on silicon carbide and we believe that's the performance play that will win the slots there and then our focus now has really been on driving cost out.","We're first in the industry to get to six inch and we're also doing a tremendous amount of work on very low cost packaging for that marketplace, so about 50% in base station. And then on the Defense side we see that market somewhere being around $350 million or so in the next few years as well. We're very well positioned on Defense side, number one in the market.","Both of those segments are growing above right around 25%. Defense is perhaps a bit faster but both very, very healthy. Now on top of that also is our cable business, maybe not the most rapidly growing but we have great market share and GaN really is the semiconductor of choice especially for these DOCSIS 3.1 products that we've got out on the market now.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for the color and then switching back to Mobile. I guess, now that the new flagship's out from your largest customer, obviously the tear downs are just indicating larger content in maybe one model type and then effectively not in the other. Can you just remind us what your sort of blended RF content is, this generation compared to say last year's generation?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I'm not sure we're going to be able to give that to you right now. I apologize for that. What we can say is \u2013 we continue to grow there, continue to grow revenue dollars per handset each year, so we're in pretty good shape from that perspective.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I had two. First of all you're talking about a 50% margin target longer term. I think I was looking back at my notes, so I think we used to talk about margins possibly pushing 55%. So I guess the first question is sort of what happened to that 500 basis points? Was there some permanent loss from these issues you've been having?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. As far as the gross margin targets, when we presented one time back November a year ago we talked about driving our margins between 50% and 55%. I think what Mark and I have both said today is we're still comfortable with getting better than 50% gross margin, so that's still in the realm of possibilities.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess I wanted to ask on the trajectory to get back there. You had talked about it taking like six quarters, but is it really \u2013 is it a SKU-based issue so that when you move this low-band PAD SKU off, when you cycle that through, that's when the margins are going to really come back, so it's probably a bit more back-end loaded as you kind of look out the next six quarters?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Okay. First, I want to make sure we understand, we talked a little bit about this I think last quarter when we talked about that program. Our expectations are it's a multi-year program so it does continue to live on, as you will, greater than 12 months.","Many of the things that Mark talked about are, if you will, also a little bit out in time so when you couple those two things, yeah, it starts to really pick up on the out quarters. Plus, as we also talked about loading of our factories, next year is when we expect that we're going to be very well loaded in our SAW facilities along with our BAW facilities and we actually haven't enjoyed that.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Tim, I think it's important to note that the path to 50%-plus does require that we have more BAW-based content. It's better. It's higher-value business, we're solving more difficult problems so the price point's better, and again, our lowest utilized fab at the moment is our BAW fab in Texas. So once we load that we're going to get tremendous benefits on the absorption and then we also get the benefits on mix.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, Mark. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi Bob. Hi, Mark. Wanted to follow-up on the gross margin; if I could go back to last quarter you guys sort of guided down gross margin I thought mostly because you had to use outsourced SAW filters and some of the high volume runners. This quarter you're talking about having some yield issues on the SAW process that you've talked about. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, are you still buying a lot of SAW filters externally and just not getting good margin on the pass-through, or have you been able to in-source that production and as you tried to ramp the in-sourced production you ran into this yield issue? And so we've had sort of a changing impact on that gross margin?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Quinn, we are still buying a tremendous amount of filters. Last quarter we talked an awful lot about filter independence, and as far as \u2013 we're still continuing to add to our design resources. Mark talked a little bit about the OpEx increase. We're adding designers and continue \u2013 because we see a lot of opportunities to reduce our costs through that.","The part that we're talking about, yes, it does use outsourced filters, but it also had some of our internal filters in there, and that's the yield issue that Eric talked through. And I think we commented last call, but I'll make it clear again. This is a product that we're not able to change the process, nor the product design for its multi-year life. So we're going to have this for a while. What we do believe is that the low-band PAD market is a good market for us. We will have the right cost structure, and we'll remain competitive.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Just a follow-up on that, Bob. Obviously, you've got a near-term yield issue that you've identified and you fixed. When you fix that yield issue, does that go away and the overhang really is just the fact that you still use a fair amount of outsourced SAW filters, or can you not improve the yields in that particular PAD for the life of that product?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, Quinn, this is Eric. I guess the detail on that is, we have certainly addressed the issue at the module yield level which is the big dollars, of course, of fallout. We're going to continue to run this product for its lifetime with sub-par line yields in the factory, if you will.","Now, of course, the volumes will tail much lower next year and so forth as the new handset ramps to replace the current one, as we have new products that are brought up, they expect to \u2013 we expect those to yield as they should. So, yield highly and improve the margin going forward.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. And then, just a quick one, in the past quarters you've given us a percent of revs from your largest customer, just wondering if you can provide that again this quarter?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I'm sorry, Quinn. Could you repeat it? It was a little bit garbled. I thought it was something about our largest customer?","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","In past quarters you've given us the percent of revenue from that largest customer and I don't think I caught it. I apologize if I missed, but I don't think you gave that percent of revenue from your largest customer this quarter.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","All right. We'll give you that in just a second.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, it's roughly 40% of Mobile.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, it's a little over 30% for the company then.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot guys. I was just curious, and I believe you guys commented that you would expect to see double-digit revenue growth going forward and I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And would that be sort of each quarter or on an average over some period of time you get double-digit revenue growth?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I guess, we didn't really break it out. I think what we're very comfortable in is we can grow the business next fiscal year double-digits.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then sort of following up on a previous question, not necessarily for a particular customer but overall it seemed like you'd been getting roughly 20% dollar content increase from one generation of phone to the next. So sort of generically speaking across the platforms you're winning, does it seem reasonable as we look forward in the coming year, that you'd expect to see sort of that 20% or a little better, or a little worse? Any thoughts on that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. For the Mobile side, I think that is a possibility. We're seeing a trend towards full solutions and really this is across all tiers, both in our RF Flex portfolio as well as RF Fusion. We have customers now asking us to do a complete reference design, everything from the transceiver to the antenna essentially and of course Qorvo is unique in having that capability of having all those products and the system architecture and even power management in-house. So we do see great opportunities to actually see some phenomenal content growth across especially if you look at our kind of Asia customer base the Tier 2 customers in Asia which are driving now a great deal of the units in the industry. So I think as you average that out we can continue to see those kind of content increases.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","And this is James. That content story really holds for multiple markets. I mean, things, if you look in the Wi-Fi spaces we move to 8x8 MIMO, we see big content growth in the base station market as Massive MIMO comes along. That's also a significant driver for us in content. So that is really holding true for us in several of the markets that we serve. Auto is another example. We're moving from traditional SDARs to now content with LTE and even more in the future. We expect probably 350 million connected cars in the next few years.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Just to follow-up on the \u2013 Quinn, the question you asked. So, top customer 35% of total Qorvo revenues. Two customers that are over 10% share \u2013 or 10% of our mix, the total there is 46%, the combined top two and then the top 10 customers are 63%.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Curtis \u2013 or I'm sorry, Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and sorry to go back on the margin \u2013 but just trying to understand what \u2013 last call you talked about all of these issues in terms of yield particularly on low-band PADs. So I'm just trying to figure out, I mean, I'm assuming you knew that ramp was coming so I guess what went against you, were the yield issues greater than you expected and just trying to understand the timeline there.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Blayne, this is Eric. Yeah. The yield issue that we're reporting and talking about today is actually entirely different than what we were talking about on the last call. The last call we were ramping just beginning volume and seeing sort of garden variety normal ramp issues working on \u2013 kind of tuning out of the filters themselves and getting them in spec and so forth. And then as we said late in the quarter once we got into volume we began to find parts that were out of spec essentially that were not caught in the die-level screens.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I got you. And then I'm just curious as you said that you had picked your quadplexer yields and I'm just kind of curious as you look forward to hexaplexers and closing the gap in terms of the lead there, when do you expect to have those shipping in volume next year?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, the question is when do we expect to be shipping hexaplexers in volume?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, so the first part of your question on the quadplexer yields, just confirming again that we have got those straightened out, that's shipping on our baseline process. The new advanced BAW process which we just released will have the quadplexers shipping first half of next year and currently expect hexaplexers to ship second half of next year also on that advanced BAW process.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I just want to ask you one follow-up question on \u2013 one of your Japanese competitors has been talking about improved SAW. Just kind of curious, your perspective BAW versus improving TC-SAW. Do you think, particularly as you move to these carrier aggregation combinations, do you see any combination where a TC could insert itself?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","I think we see a lot of opportunity for modules that have both technologies in them and of course we're agnostic pretty much to which one wins, but there are some conditions in which some bands are getting tougher that were traditionally SAW or TC-SAW that we see BAW moving into, but I think the opportunity of putting both technologies into a module is unique for us and that will help address some parts of the market.","Operator","And we do have time for a final question from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thanks for fitting me in. You got a lot of questions on execution, but my question is, as you work with your top customer, how do you think they feel about the Qorvo supplier engagement? Do you think they're getting fulfilled properly as they ramp their flagship, what are your thoughts on the future opportunities, they talked about shortages? Thanks.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, great question. And I think the relationship is very much intact. We worked very closely together as you can imagine and the Qorvo team obviously we never liked to have these sorts of issues, but I'd tell you the entire manufacturing team really buckled down and focused and did some incredible work to make sure we're able to recover from the material that was taken out of the line and still keep up with demand. So I think overall again, it's not the situation you want to have, but you can really learn a lot about each other and actually gain some trust through these sorts of situations.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's all I had.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you, Ian.","Operator","And I'll now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you for joining us today. Qorvo is at the center of a growing global framework interconnecting people, places and things, and we are uniquely positioned as complexity drives higher levels of integration, narrowing the playing field, and supporting superior financial results in the future.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Douglas DeLieto. Please go ahead, sir.","Doug DeLieto","Thanks very much, Travis. Hi, everybody, and welcome to the Qorvo March 2015 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as our most recent SEC filings for a complete description. You should also read and consider the risk factors associated with each of the businesses of RFMD and TriQuint in each company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risks may affect the operations and the financial results of the combined company.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or unusual items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results.

[Operator Instructions] Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Steve Buhaly, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to welcome everyone to Qorvo's Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Just 4 months into the merger of RFMD and TriQuint, Qorvo is accomplishing what our 2 organizations could not have achieved individually. In mobile devices, infrastructure and defense applications, Qorvo is uniquely positioned to connect people, networks and things, both wirelessly and over global wired networks. Our financial results for March and our June quarterly guidance clearly demonstrate the integration is progressing exceptionally well and the Qorvo team continues to find new ways to build upon our shared strengths.","Our markets are robust and our new product launches and customer design activity point to significant revenue growth throughout calendar year 2015. In addition, we are confident in our ability to deliver a run rate exceeding $75 million in synergies exiting this calendar year, and we see a clear path to a run rate of greater than $150 million in synergies exiting calendar year 2016.","Qorvo is leveraging our expanded portfolio of best-in-class products and technologies across growth markets and we're helping our customers to design, manufacture and launch their products more quickly and more efficiently. We're also capturing incremental growth opportunities across diversified applications that favor our process technology expertise, engineering and manufacturing scale, advanced packaging capabilities and other unique competitive strengths.","It's worth noting that Qorvo offers the most complete product portfolio, targeting the highest growth segments of our market, including filters, switches and tuners. Qorvo is recognized globally in each of these categories as a performance leader and there's no company better suited than Qorvo to capture revenue in either discrete or integrated implementations. Whether you're talking about the Internet of Things, the connected car, wearables, tablets, smartphones, smart homes, radar, avionics systems or communications infrastructure, we've got more tools and a deeper set of skills, and we're capitalizing on our unique set of competitive strengths to deliver highly differentiated, high-value solutions to industry leaders and transformative growth markets. This positions Qorvo to outpace the rate of growth of our underlying markets and deliver superior financial results.","Looking at the March quarter. Revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $634 million when comparing to RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. Revenue growth was led by mobile products, which grew 61% year-over-year. Qorvo's gross margin was 50.4%, operating margin was 26.8% and earnings per share were $1.11. Revenue gross margin and EPS were all well ahead of our original guidance.","Supporting this strong performance, the demand for mobile data continues to explode. Qorvo is a leading beneficiary of the robust growth in data traffic and we enjoy strong participation in the highest volume, highest value devices across the mobile infrastructure and defense markets. In particular, I'd like to highlight some of our more exciting strategic achievements during the quarter intended to diversify and grow our revenue.","Qorvo secured a design win with a major base station OEM with a 3.5 gigahertz MMPA who began field trials to support major operators in China, Europe, Japan and North America. Qorvo launched a broad family of multimode PAs and duplexer modules covering major cellular bands for the small cell base station market. We were selected as the primary supplier of 802.11ac 5 gigahertz PA for a next generation .11ac wave 2 chipset. We enjoyed increased design traction on leading mobile Wi-Fi reference design, including Wi-Fi front-end solutions, integrating active components and filters into a single placement.","We launched production of our high-performance GPS LNA filter modules for a leading fitness wearable device manufacturer. We secured our first received diversity module design win in support of a flagship Android smartphone scheduled to launch in the second half of calendar year 2015. And finally, we received production orders for our RF flex solution, supporting a next generation octa-core 4G chipset, with shipments commencing in the current quarter. I'm quite proud of the Qorvo team and their ability to achieve these many accomplishments, while also executing on our internal initiatives targeting growth, diversification and margin expansion. Simply stated, it's our goal to drive revenue, diversify our revenue and earn more money off that revenue.","To that end, we're making steady progress towards our goal of bringing up our second facility in China to in-source the assembly and test of legacy TriQuint products, and we expect to begin shipments in the December quarter. We're also leveraging our combined strengths to open new avenues of growth, many of which are coming in the form of highly integrated RF devices. Qorvo's Wi-Fi front-end solutions integrating active components and filters, and our received diversity modules are both excellent examples.","In the case of our received diversity modules, we've combined 2 of the fastest-growing functions in RF, premium BAW filters and high-performance, high throw count [ph] switches and highly integrated compact single placements. This makes them unique in our industry and are intersecting customer demand at the right time, as smartphone manufacturers increasingly migrate from SAW to BAW to solve the interference challenges of higher band count and carrier aggregation. From a very high level, we believe we're just beginning to demonstrate the value of bringing our 2 companies together, and we expect to build on that as we realize the full run rate of our cost synergies and introduce new products and technologies we could not have achieved individually.","In summary, our March quarterly performance, coupled with our June quarterly guidance and our expectations for a very strong calendar second half point to an exceptional first year for Qorvo. We're building momentum and we believe we can continue to build upon our financial performance in calendar year 2016. Qorvo is well-positioned to win more than our share of the industry's highest growth opportunities by leveraging our diversified product portfolio, systems-level expertise, R&D and manufacturing scale and internal assembly and test capabilities. We expect to continue to improve our financial performance as we invest in building a wider technology moat, supporting better-than-industry growth, greater diversification, a richer mix of new products and an expanding gross margin.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for further color on Qorvo's financial performance. Steve?","Steven J. Buhaly","Thanks, Bob. In the March quarter, Qorvo delivered a robust 46% year-on-year growth in revenue, $634 million when compared to RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. Growth was led by mobile, up 61% to $493 million. IDP reported revenue of $140 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Qorvo had 2 10% customers. The larger, at approximately 37% of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Gross margin was a record 50.4%, up sequentially from 49% for RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. The improvement in Qorvo's gross margin was primarily attributable to favorable product mix, improved yields and synergies.","Operating expenses were $150 million for the March quarter. Synergy-driven reductions in G&A were offset by increased spending in R&D, for masks and filters designers. Operating income was $169.6 million versus $25.3 million in the year-ago period for RFMD and TriQuint combined. Net income for the March quarter was $167.2 million or $1.11 per diluted share on 150.5 million shares outstanding. This compares favorably to the original guidance of $0.80 to $0.90. Higher revenue and strong execution accounted for about $0.15 of the improvement from the midpoint of guidance while lower taxes contributed $0.09 and share count related to the timing of the merger contributed the remaining $0.02.","Total cash and investments was $544.6 million and cash flow from operations totaled [ph] $138 million. Capital expenditures were $120 million, primarily to address continued growth in customer demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 760,000 shares at a total cost of $50 million.","Now let's turn to our business outlook. In Qorvo, we've created a new leader in RF that can outpace the growth rate of our underlying markets. Total addressable market for mobile RF is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% to 15% over the next few years, driven primarily by unit growth of 4G phones and the associated dramatic increase in RF content and complexity.","In calendar 2015, we expect the growth profile for the industry to mirror prior years, with March the only quarter down sequentially and revenue weighted growing heavily towards the second half over the calendar year.","For the product portfolio serving the faster growing parts of our addressable market, we're excited about the growth prospects and feel we can exceed the industry's growth rate.","At our Analyst Day last November, we increased our operating model goals to 50% margin and 30% operating margin. Achieving nearly 27% operating income in a seasonally weak quarter is a great start for Qorvo. Add in the substantial synergies yet to come and we feel we can hit these goals while making significant investments in the process technologies and great products that sustain and enhance our competitive advantage. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the June 2015 quarter: quarterly revenue in the range of $660 million to $670 million; gross margin approximately consistent with the prior quarter; a tax rate in the range of 10% to 15%; and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.10 on about 154 million shares.","We're confident we can outpace our markets this year and our guidance for June implies a robust 5% sequential revenue growth. Solid operating leverage is expected to drive operating income up about 10% sequentially. During FY '16, we believe our tax rate will increase from a minimal level of the past to a more sustainable tax rate as recent profitability has consumed much of our remaining net operating losses. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and such differences may be material. Finally, we currently expect to report June quarter results on July 29.","With that, we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question, Bob, how should we think about seasonality in the back half? If you could give us some color around visibility, around content or design wins. I know in the past, when I look at the pro forma models, the combined companies have grown at least about 20% in the back half calendar year versus the first half. Is that still a reasonable expectation for this year?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Vivek. Thanks for your kind words and your question. As far as seasonality goes, number one, we have very good visibility into the major launches of marquee phones from multiple customs -- customers throughout the back half of the year. As far as what the industry is going to perform and how many phones actually get sold and all that, tough for us to handle at this time. But I think a high-level premise of the seasonality that you typically saw between the 2 companies, not much of that has changed yet. We are just really releasing, as I talked about in my opening comments, some of the newer products that we believe we can layer on top of what we typically had done to change that profile. But as a starting point, Vivek, that's a great model that you threw out there. The real thing is what's the industry going to do and it's way too early to comment on that, but thank you.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as my follow up, maybe one on gross margins, almost 300 points better than we expected. I'm curious, why such a big delta? And now that you have achieved your long-term gross margin target in the weakest seasonal quarter, what's next, is it time to rethink the target model?","Steven J. Buhaly","Yes. So first, it's tempting to take you up on that rethinking the target model, and we wouldn't be thinking lower. We'd be thinking higher. But just to be clear -- but that model is for full year. We like a little bit more time to execute against that and really deliver that on a full year basis. But your point's well taken. With respect to the margin in the quarter, I think one thing that helped that you might not have thought of is, this is the seasonally low period for mobile. And as you know, our IDP revenue has a higher inherent margin. And so the weighted average benefits from that in the March quarter. Also, a thing that was better than we expected was manufacturing yields, really stepped up in the quarter. A real tip of the hat to all our manufacturing team and the engineers who contributed as well. We saw some really good performance there. And then of course, synergies are starting to contribute to the model. And it's always a little bit of a question how quick they'll come in. But we did make some good progress in the quarter and I know you know this. But synergies tend to be cumulative as we go through the quarters and I think we're off to a pretty good start there.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, one last quick one, if I may. What is the right mix. If I look long-term off your Mobile versus the Non-mobile business and what role Bob do you think M&A could play in that? Because you have a very solid balance sheet. You are generating a good amount of cash. How do you put it to better use through diversification and non-mobile markets?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Vivek. As far as looking at the 2 businesses today, I mean, you guys can do the math and I won't embarrass myself by telling you the percentages. But it's quite clear that the mobile business is a little bit bigger than the IDP business and growing a little bit faster. So obviously, if we're active in M&A opportunities and looking at targets, they would tend to be more in the IDP-type of business [indiscernible] build that up. There are still areas of opportunities within the mobile business as well to acquire technologies or smaller companies that we can enable new products and things like that. So I would say we will and we are looking at opportunities in both businesses. But I think over time, if you listen to our talk about continuing to diversify our products, our markets and our technologies, that's going to tend to lean a lot more towards James' IDP business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Looking at the June quarter guide, the mobile environment has definitely some areas of strength on the high-end with Apple and some weaker reports on the lower mid-tier. Would you describe the strength you're seeing in the June quarter as broad-based or is it more concentrated in China per se versus the top tier?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Yes, thanks for the comments, Mike. At a very high level, I mean, what we are seeing is what's everybody knows, the RF market place is still extremely strong. It's really the macro shift to 4G. And I think most people know that a lot of that is being done in China through multiple customers. I mean, diversification across their end products and customers. So that's what's really starting to drive that growth.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then following up on Vivek's question, I know you're not going to raise your margin target yet for us. But I'm just wondering if we could -- what we should be thinking about for a contribution margin another seasonal strong second half. And that also, on OpEx side, Steve, I think you guys have spoken about a lot of the synergies really starting to hit in the second half. Any puts or takes we should be thinking about as we -- as we go on to the second half of this calendar year?","Steven J. Buhaly","Yes, sure. On gross margin side, I think you should model a fall-through of 55%. I think we can execute to that. And with respect to operating expenses, we will see some synergies. We also may make investments. Those are really contingent on the level of business we're able to earn. And I think you'll see us continuing to drive towards our business model of 50, 20, 30.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steven Smigie","One thing you mentioned a few times is obviously the -- that LTE will be a big driver of success for you. Can you talk about what your mix is of LTE or 4G versus 3G at this point?","Steven Eric Creviston","This is Eric. Speaking for mobile. We have, now, well over 95% of our revenues in 3G, 4G. We don't break out between them because we have a lot of components which are used in both. But it's clearly LTE that's driving due to not only the proliferation of LTE throughout China but also just the overall content growth in literally all the markets that are running LTE today.","Steven Smigie","Okay, great. And you had mentioned a number of good Wi-Fi and other wins. Can you talk a little bit about how big Wi-Fi opportunity is for you? Or what is the percentage of revenue and how big do you think that opportunity can be going forward?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I think what I will do, Steve, is since we've got Wi-Fi split between Eric and James, I'll let them talk about what's driving their business from a Wi-Fi perspective. Because we did talk about pretty exciting products for both groups in our prepared comments as well as in the press release -- James, you want to talk a little bit about Wi-Fi?","James L. Klein","This is James. Thanks for the question. I mean, we're seeing 2 dynamics that are really helping us grow in the Wi-Fi market on my side of the world. The shift to 11ac has certainly been very beneficial for us and we're also seeing the carriers drive to more offload on Wi-Fi in high-density areas. So both of those dynamics are really helping us grow. Of course, we're excited about new set of product that we've got released and being on some key reference designs in 5 gigahertz or higher power areas. So it looks good so far.","Steven Eric Creviston","And then on the mobile side, it is one of our largest growth drivers this year in terms of just the overall opportunity. It's about $1 billion opportunity out there in mobile Wi-Fi for us. And we're doing really, really well with some differentiated technology on the filter side. And the part that we announced as one of the strategic highlights is something very similar to RF Fusion and what we do in the cellular modem, but this is in the Wi-Fi front end for mobile in which we combine all the power amplifiers, switches and those differentiated filter components into a very compact, single-placement, high-performance solution, and we're seeing participation now across the major reference designs and we're confident that's going to lead to revenue in the second of fiscal year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Steve, could you please remind us where we are on the BAW filter expansion and how much that had an impact on the quarter gross margins? You saw a really good margin but you named several things including synergies. I'm just trying to go figure on where you are and what the official line is on that. I know you said double BAW capacity between, say, December of last year to June 1, and then at NWC [ph], there was some talk about tripling it. Just want to get an idea of where you are, what kind of impact that had on the big picture. And then for Eric, in mobile, are you still shooting -- overall, are you still shooting to maintain a more even exposure to some of the bigger handset OEMs? I think we had talked at one point of like 5 20, 20% for Sam's, 20% Apple, 20% leading Chinese OEM, 20% white label. Is that still your goal and are you structuring the new company in order to achieve that by deemphasizing some guys and focusing more on others? And then James, real quick, TriQuint has a real strong offering in 5 gigahertz, Wi-Fi amp, some couple of years ago. But they seem to deemphasize that late last year. Is that where you're seeing your advantage in 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi? Or is this -- this new HBT 5 process that's helping out?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Ed. I appreciate you getting everybody involved. Steve, if you want to take the first one that had to do with that BAW filters expansion, and where we are on that ramp.","Steven J. Buhaly","Thank you. Glad you remember that, Bob. In terms of BAW filter capacity, we are continuing to execute the aggressive ramp in capacity that we've been talking about for some time. We expect this phase to wrap up close to the end of this quarter in preparation for a seasonally stronger revenue period and higher demand period that we will see in the second half of the year. And we feel very good, it's going very well. As you know, it's fairly fungible. We're adding equipment as we go and increasing capacity somewhat linearly. So it's not like a Big Bang event. And it's going very well and we're very pleased with it. And I think we'll be well-positioned to serve the growth in demand that we expect to continue to see.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Does it have a big impact on margins this quarter, Steve?","Steven J. Buhaly","Not really, no. A little bit, but not materially. We don't depreciate the equipment until it's put into service. And the bulk of equipment actually placed into service will be in the current quarter.","Steven Eric Creviston","Right. So I'll talk about target exposure to customers, if I understood the question, right? As a -- just a high-level strategy, I suppose, we want to be broadly exposed to the market, which means we want the share of our revenue that each customer contributes to be roughly equal to the share of their opportunity. So we're not looking to overweight or underweight on any particular segment or customer. But probably, far more important than that, is we're operating to a very disciplined financial model. We're constantly seeking ways to grow the topline while improving profitability and that happens at the product level, not at the customer level. A lot of our products which are highly profitable cut across most of our customers, frankly. So we're looking for those opportunities. That's what we're prioritizing in our investments where do we get the highest profitability and the highest growth. And how do we continue to hit the financial model.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","James, you want to talk about a little bit of Wi-Fi and 5 gigahertz?","James L. Klein","Yes, and I think it's important to notice, to think about this a little different. I'm going to really focus you on the CPE side. So we're going to talk about Gateway and enterprise predominantly. Our focus has been in this 5 gigahertz area. So we've recently released what we think are the industry-leading set of components and those PAs. And we continue to develop those products. So I -- not really focused on the back, on the past and us getting out, I think we are very, very focused on that market and we've got some great products.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And does this have anything to do with HBT 5?","James L. Klein","Well, as always, we continue to develop new next-generation technologies and focusing on investing and make sure that we've got the best processes in the industry. So that next generation of HBT will certainly play a role in this part of the market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens Inc.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A lot of semi-companies are missing numbers, so really good to see you guys doing so well. I want to go back to the gross margin. To Vivek's point earlier, it was almost 300 basis points higher. I want to kind of understand what if there was any role that the cost cuts played yet and what roles? And so continuation of that question is, what are some of the major things that are planned? I think you've sort of officially just upped your expectation for cost cuts to a little over $75 million. I want to understand what are some of the major projects that are underway, maybe the top 2 that -- if you want to highlight them.","Steven J. Buhaly","Yes, sure. I would be happy to. I think sooner rather than later, earlier on, we should see savings in the supply chain. In particular, we do see some management efficiencies, if you will. And those are fairly -- we were able to get to those fairly quickly. I think a very significant initiative that will be partially in place this year, mostly in place in the second calendar year will be the migration of TriQuint's mobile parts into a new Chinese factory for assembly and test. We think that will be significant driver of improved margins and savings for us. So those are a couple of the bigger hitters.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, what about the margin question? The 50% or so margins that -- and then again, I'm not complaining because those are great numbers. But just want to understand, if cost cuts yet have played a function already or it's all on the [indiscernible]?","Steven J. Buhaly","Yes. Some of the supply chain savings came in to effect, pretty shortly after the merger was effective, right? [indiscernible] helped us out a little bit, gave us some extra time to prepare. We did take advantage of that. And we were able to implement some of those savings almost immediately after the close. And so we did see benefit there and, as mentioned earlier, some business unit mix benefits with mobile being seasonally weak in the quarter. Some mix benefits within that, with the strength in filters and switches. Higher growing parts of the business. And finally, yields really got better. The team just did a really good job on driving waste out of the manufacturing process with better yield.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Yes. And Harsh, that may not sound like it but that was a lot of sharing back and forth between the 2 organizations on how to improve yields.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. And as a follow up, if I can ask you, I think China was -- the data from China seems to be a little bit off in January and February. Your competitor mentioned that things picked up substantially in the March timeframe. Could you just comment on maybe what you guys are seeing at a ground level in the Chinese market, maybe relative to expectations and guidance for June and then even beyond?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Yes. I think, Harsh, the quarter pretty much played out as we expected, except near the end of March, things did start to pick up. We're continuing to see that. And that's what playing into our guidance. But I'll let Eric give a little more color, if you want.","Steven Eric Creviston","I think that's pretty much it. We said in January, we expected to be kind of slow until we got through the lunar New Year and then it would pop up but with the late lunar New Year, we weren't sure how much exposure we'd see in March. But it did turn up at the very end of March to start picking up. We've seen that continue into this quarter and the year is still looking to be very much on track. There's a lot of excitement about growth there and the 4G rollout, as you know, the net adds have been running averaging about 20 million a month for 4G in China. So right now, the market's pretty robust. There's going to be a need for a lot more 4G handsets. And we've got a tremendous opportunity for content growth there.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Harsh, Harsh, I do want to point out that there was also some talk lately from a couple of people about a slight slowdown or a pause or a break or whatever you want to say in the infrastructure market. We actually had a very strong first quarter -- or excuse me, March quarter in the infrastructure market. And for the first quarter, we think that's going to be down, down some quarter-over-quarter. So we are seeing a little bit of a slowdown on the infrastructure side.","Steven J. Buhaly","And I know we're in the community that believes it's an inventory issue. We think the underlying demand drivers are well intact. And it's a matter of timing and what we do expect a little bit of a burn-off period here in the June quarter. And we've incorporated that into our guidance.","Steven Eric Creviston","And to reiterate that, that's in the infrastructure side.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Infrastructure side of the business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on Harsh's question there about China. If look at the -- one of your big name partners [indiscernible] looks like they have a fairly soft first half but are talking about $450 million smartphone chipsets which implies a very strong second half, I think up over 50%, half on half. Just wondering, as you look past June, are you seeing sort of a similar strength in second half versus first half or do you think your growth is going to be a little bit more linear through the year? And then as a second follow-on question for Steve, Steve, you talked about that tax rate stepping up to a range of 10% to 15%. But then you made a comment about a higher tax rate long-term as you've now used up most of the NOLs. Is that higher rate 10% to 15%? Or do you think it could step up beyond 10% to 15%, say, 1 year or 2 out in the future?","Steven J. Buhaly","Why don't I take the tax one first. So what's going on in '16, we have 2 kind of contravening items. First, we're in the process of implementing a tax structure and RFMD, and it's similar to what TriQuint just had in place in the past where we had Singapore as our international headquarters and recognized the international revenue in that jurisdiction. And we won't have that in place until probably August 1. So there's a little bit of a higher than normal impact there. On the other hand, we still have some remaining NOLs. So those are offsetting each other to some degree. I think the rate beyond FY '16 is still an open question. Our [indiscernible] tax is entering and I have some work left to do. A lot of it depends on where revenue gets recognized, different jurisdictions, where we sell out, what the mix of products is. But I think that we'll-- it's hard to say. It's possible it could creep up just a little bit. But there's plenty of work left for us to do to get a better answer for you. So this year though, we feel like the cash rate will -- or non-GAAP rate will be in the 10% to 15% range.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for the additional color Steve.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Eric, you want to take it?","Steven Eric Creviston","So I guess regarding the China question. We can't say a whole lot more than we already have. I mean MediaTek's pointing towards a good back half. We agree. As Bob said at the beginning, it's too early to call the back half. But some of the things to look for are continued 4G net adds. Also, I think the export market is going to be pretty important to our China customers this year. And of course, MediaTek's open to help drive some of that. We're very well-represented. We mentioned the strategic highlights, both new 4G smartphones for -- these are leading flagship smartphones that are launching now which will be in full production throughout the year. And which we've got multiple dollars of content and then in addition to that, our first RF flex. We just announced this in Barcelona. We've got production orders already. We're ramping shipments right now as we speak. And so we'll have a full half year the second half of the calendar year to be shipping that RF flex solution. So yes, a lot of things to be excited in there in that market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Cody Acree with Ascendiant Capital.","Cody Grant Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Eric, maybe on a road map basis, now that you've got the assets, the 2 companies put together, how is that impacting your longer-term roadmap for products and -- I think about from a maybe an RF Fusion or a module-integration strategy, how long does it take before we start to see some of those products on the market?","Steven Eric Creviston","Yes. Thanks for the question. I can tell you, it's a very target-rich environment, right now. We literally have all the pieces we need now that we put the company together. As you can imagine, the things that we're selling right now are still basically the roadmap of the previous companies, the legacy companies. The diversity received modular, I mentioned in the strategic highlights, probably one of the first examples of a new product category that we're able to address as Qorvo which wasn't that attractive. Again, we're executing on this financial model. You looked at that model as separate companies, didn't really fit so much. But there's a couple of reasons why that's exciting to Qorvo. One is that it combines the best-in-class switching with also, now, filters and LNAs as well. And we think this is a great opportunity, it's about $1 billion segment today that should double over the next 3 years and we're essentially not playing it all until we have this launch this fall, obviously a design win we announced. So that's one example of a new product area where we think we can really differentiate by bringing BAW technology into that segment which is all SAW today. And there's a lot of other examples. RF flex infusion, as you know, we're really helping to drive the integration levels higher in the industry. We're working out multiple generations now with not only our key customers but probably more importantly, all of the major platform providers. And the trend is crystal clear, it's about integration, it's about enabling real proliferation of high-performance compact [indiscernible] systems and it's the core technologies we bring in switches and filtering, power management system architecture, that's what enabling it. So target-rich environment, we got a lot of opportunities, we're focusing on where we think we can grow and be the most profitable.","Cody Grant Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then maybe Eric, just following up on both tracking and carrier aggregation, can you just talk about maybe where we are and adoption of both of those technologies and are those helping you to gain share? Just how is that impacting growth?","Steven Eric Creviston","Yes. So inflow tracking, as we've talked about, I think in Barcelona, is still kind of relegated to the very top tier. We are hearing more discussions with wider range of platform providers that'll be taking it down in the mid-tier. But that's going to take some time. It's really kind of a next year activity. So inflow tracking is important. But I wouldn't say it's a driver right now, unless it's separate in the very top tier. The carrier aggregation is quite a bit more prominent. That is everywhere right now. There's over 50 -- over 50 different combinations of carrier aggregation scenarios that we're now working to help enable with different band combinations and different carriers and so forth. And the thing that's common about all of them is it drives requirements for switching and filtering. So we're very, very actively engaged with carrier aggregation work right now. I'm sure you're aware, even uplink carrier aggregation is coming next year as well for China Mobile. So that's a definite driver in the design activity in what we're specifying our products in terms of capability.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe for Bob or Eric. I'm just curious, as you look in the Junior Mobile business, you just talked about what's driving the growth. You typically -- your largest customer, you talked about 37% March. That's maybe a stronger decline than others have seen. So you saw that last year where you're then somewhere modest June. If you can just talk about some of the moving pieces, you mentioned China up. Any additional color there would be appreciated.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Sorry, Blayne, could you clarify the number you said. We didn't understand. I think you said 37% decline?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Your largest customer is 37% in March, which was about a 30% decline. So maybe you saw a little bit timing-wise, a little more seasonality in March. It just kind of, as you look into June, what are the moving pieces to get to growth?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I think you were trying to compare us to others and again, I think we've got an extremely diversified product stream to that large customer. And some go right to the supplier that builds the phones. Some go to the sub-suppliers. So there's timing differences all the time. And our ramps up and down with any customer, it doesn't matter. Many of them use different subs and things like that. So Blayne, I wouldn't read much too much into that, at least on that quarter. So what was the question after that? Sorry, I thought you were relating it to the June quarter.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That wasn't really the main part of the question. I was actually just asking, you are seeing some nice growth outside of that customer into June. I was just looking for what are the big moving pieces there.","Steven Eric Creviston","It's certainly in the Mobile business, it's China. It's what we've been talking about. It's the new platform launches. We're represented more on some of the reference designs where we previously represented a little less and overall content growth, unit growth in China.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then first, Steve, on the OpEx line, you talked about some nice synergies in terms of gross margin. From an absolute dollar amount, I guess, it seems like OpEx is down a few million into June. What's the right level to look at? I know you don't want to raise your long-term model here. But even with some growth in the second half, you'd be above that. When you look at the trajectory of just your absolute OpEx dollars, do you think it would grow off this space or you think you can still bring it down?","Steven J. Buhaly","It's again dependent on the book of business we have. We're fundamentally going to drive for a full year 20% operating expense. And if revenue is not as good as we think we'll cut more. If it's better, we'll invest more. So I don't think you should look at a lot of growth. We'll be managing it carefully. But it will be dictated by the level of revenue that we're able to achieve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","A couple of questions. Eric, could you see content gains based on the technology from both companies in the second half of this year? Or there was a 3 way -- there was a couple of 3 way in the A side last year. So given the timing of phone ramps, would those be brought to bear anytime in the calendar year here? And then on your DRX modules, they all have LNAs in them or you're also going to do passive devices like we've seen in the past where you just filters and switches on a module? And then, Bob, in the bigger picture, I'm sure you saw a lot of the action on the stock in the last couple of quarters, but especially the last quarter. There've been a lot of, though, concerns about declines in China, et cetera. Holistically, where do you think the bearish case on Qorvo is the most incorrect? I mean, a lot of you are still wondering about China, 2G, 3G, slowing down there. They're worried about maximizing content at some of the major OEMs. So if you just speak to where you think most people might have missed it on the downside of that, I'd appreciate it.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I think Ed I'll take that first, Eric can take a little bit of time to answer Ed's 2 other questions. I think, Ed, people are struggling with understanding that the RF market is growing, just high-level macro. I mean, if base bands go down, everybody thinks we're going to go down. But what they miss is, their base bands might be going down but they're shifting to 4G which needs more RF. So at a high level, it's still an extremely healthy market. I think the second area is, we sell a lot of parts quite honestly. Some of these filters are small as a grain of rice. And they're hard to find. When you look at some of our little switches and they're not identified, and you kind of go through this and people do teardowns and some of these phones we look at after they do their teardowns because we know we're in them, we don't look for it. And in fact, in many of these places, they're strengths of ours. We'll find 30% to 40% was not even identified in the teardown. So I think again, people have to first get their head around the complexity of what's in a 4G phone of not only integrated components. Even in highly integrated phones, there's a lot of discrete still out there. And we enjoy a lot of that business, Ed. So again, RF is a great place to be right now and we're enjoying it and we have the right products.","Steven J. Buhaly","And I would throw in there, and it's a similar comment. I think our success in China has been underestimated. I think that, that's a diverse set of customers. It isn't quite as prone to the major event teardown, kind of press event. But going back to the pre-merger, both companies have had real success there. The units of 4G are growing like wildfire. And I just don't think the market fully understood both the volume increases and our success rate at that diverse set of customers.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","To that point, Steve, what is -- I mean RF Micro in the previous closure before the merger, we're kind of flattish in China and you grow through really well in, 4G and partly, because you had a big exposure to 3G and 2G nodes were declining. How -- where does that shake out this quarter? Do you still have a significant revenue in 2G, 3G or is it de minimis? And is China still flattish for you in this period? Or -- have you turned the corner and that 4G is just starting to show up as a big driver there even in that segment?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Well, I think, Eric, now he has 3 questions for you to answer.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","I pointed that to Steve so I'd give Eric a break.","Steven Eric Creviston","Thanks for the try. So yes, I mean 2G is certainly de minimis in our business and the 3G entry for the most part is as well. Again, it's hard to break out. Because a lot of that 3G stuff is in the 4G handsets as well and a lot of our components are used in both modes. So it is a little hard to break it out. But to your point, there's no question right now that the 2G, 3G headwinds are lighter than they were the past couple of quarters for us. And we're getting -- starting to see more of the full content growth from 4G. So if I could move back to the first couple of questions. The content gain, second half, yes. So the product development cycle, as you know, are generally about 9 to 18 months and then with design-ins and ramp-ups, you're not looking at major impacts from new content gains from the merger this fiscal year. It's really next fiscal year when you're going to begin to see a full portfolio of Qorvo products. The diversity received module, which you mentioned specifically, is 1 example where we are, I think, able to capture some of the content gains from the Qorvo merger during this fiscal year. And to answer your specific question, about LNAs, as far as I know, at least I believe, everyone that we're developing will have LNA capability in it. And the reason for that is, we're really attacking the premium diversity received module market. So we're not going after the kind of just diversity received modules that have been the phones in the past. We're going after the ones that are in the high band count, high carrier aggregation requirements, types of applications where, one, you need really good filters and really good switches; and then also, two, you do need LNA, you need some active components in there. That makes it a very attractive segment for us.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","But doesn't that then suggest that competition for those parts, all the traditional competition, which is a lot of the Japanese firms are doing in the past is starting, is declining because they don't have a very strong, active offering. Or is it that bunch of people plus you and Skyworks and some new ones. Is it more competitive or less competitive? And are you seeing the Japanese increasingly aggressive in the amplifier side of it now?","Steven Eric Creviston","No. Like I said, it's a target-rich environment. We're picking the ones where we think we have the most differentiation. So yes, we're going after segments where we think we have something really unique by definition. That means the competition shouldn't be as strong at it. And again, it's really just finding the intersection of where we have those differentiated strengths where there's also a problem our customer really, really needs to solve. And that's exactly the case in these diversity received modules.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And final question for James. So you saw with one of your major competitors a very big increase in their non-mobile business, but specifically around Wi-Fi. Especially now that we're going to 2 by 2, 3 by 3 and I think even Broadcom's got a 6 by 6 design out there, as a reference now. Are you seeing as much of an uptick? Is it an area that you're starting to focus, as to mention, Wi-Fi here. And again, in the CPE side, seems to be what's driving a lot of the growth these days. So 2 questions, one, are you seeing a similar trend in your end demand? And two, how do you feel your position on the reference design? Because a lot of it is reference design at both, say, Broadcom and Atheros or any of the other vendors that you could talk to. Thanks.","James L. Klein","So I would say, Ed, again, thanks for the question, we're on the verge of that. We've got some of our first key reference design wins in that area and were starting to ramp up production on those products now. So I think as we do get to the back half, we'll start to see substantial growth in that area. Certainly, that's where we're focused. We're really focused on supporting those reference designs and make sure that we have discriminating technology. So I think we'll start to see more and more ramp up in the back half, and it is a big focus area for us.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","So and final question. The -- I guess it's probably to Eric. So you -- correct me if I'm wrong, but you've enjoyed a tighter relationship with Qualcomm probably in the last 6 months or so, evolving relationship than you have in a long time prior to that. Is that starting to bear fruit in the reference designs? Do you see more traction in their general products? Or is it almost specifically focused on, I thought you would've use RF 360, how is the Qualcomm relationship evolving?","Steven Eric Creviston","Yes, you're right. We've actually managed to have a good relationship with them. They still depend on us as well as other RF suppliers for the vast majority of their RF content on their reference designs and the products that they ship. So I think it really does scale with the overall opportunity. And it's not just Qualcomm specific but with each of the reference design houses. We have an increasing amount of attention these days and therefore, content that's coming along with it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a quick question on the filter side. Are you starting to see a blur in the lines between the TC-SAW and the BAW filters these days? And which of the 2 [indiscernible] the biggest incremental opportunity for you on a near-term basis?","Steven Eric Creviston","This is Eric. I don't think there's really a blur in the line necessarily. I mean, there are more and more frequency bands coming on. And even with the existing bands, there are changes that are coming from the operators. We still work very closely with the carriers and helping to sort of influence the requirements for the filters. And there are some that are very well-addressed by temp-comp SAW, and some that are addressed by BAW and temp-comp BAW even. And we see in general, the ones that are going to be addressed by BAW are growing more rapidly. And those are the areas that we're primarily focused on.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, so you're not seeing the TC-SAWs and migrate over into where BAW filters historically have been strongest?","Steven Eric Creviston","No. In fact, we see several cases where BAW is taking what is more traditional SAW content. TC-SAW applies to a few bands areas specifically and very, very well. We don't see that changing. The overall trend is kind of between SAW and BAW. And the diversity received modules we've talked about several times today are an example of were able to take what's SAW before and replace that with BAW and actually add value to the customer.","Steven J. Buhaly","Hey, Tom, it's Steve Buhaly here. Sometimes when you look out there, you see people talking about -- I've seen TC-SAWs encroaching and moving up to higher frequencies and all that stuff. Typically, the source of those are people who only have access to TC-SAW filter technology. And Qorvo, as you know, produces both those. We're a neutral party and will deliver the technology that serves the customer [indiscernible] best.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","We thank you for joining us today for Qorvo's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Qorvo's a primary beneficiary of the exploding demand for mobile data and the increasing RF content in connected devices. We're outpacing our markets and expect to deliver strong operating leverage as we implement our integration plan and capture merger synergies.

[Operator Instructions]","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; and Dean Priddy, Chief Financial Officer. I'm also joined by Eric Creviston and Norm Hilgendorf, who lead our Cellular Products Group and Multi-Market Products Group, respectively, as well as other members of RFMD's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone. In the September quarter, RFMD continued to benefit from the increasing global demand for mobile data. Revenue grew approximately 17% year-over-year to $362 million. Gross profit was $174 million. Operating income was $100 million, and earnings per share were $0.30. Each of these were company records, reflecting sharp focus and crisp execution by the RFMD team and supported by favorable market dynamics.","Across the mobile data landscape, consumers are demanding more bandwidth to support their data-hungry applications. Carriers are requiring greater throughput from their available spectrum, and device manufacturers are seeking greater functionality within the same footprint, with a bias towards broader network coverage in global and superregional flagship devices. In each instance, RFMD solutions are a key enabling technology.","Dating back to the transition from analog to digital cellular standards, every increase in the efficient delivery of mobile data has depended on some combination of increased RF content, increased RF functionality or increased RF performance. We've seen download speeds rocket from kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second. And over the next several years, our industry is targeting 1 gigabyte per second. These increases have come through either new modulation schemes or increasing bandwidth.","New modulation schemes embed more data in the available spectrum to deliver substantial increases in throughput. However, the higher data density requires enhanced RF performance. Also, innovation cycles require years, and the implementation of every next-generation technology introduces new complexity and new challenges for the device manufacturers, base station manufacturers and network operators.","Between these generational cycles, from analog to 2G, from 3G to 4G and from 4G to 5G, additional bandwidth can be added to boost throughput. But this brings new challenges for device manufacturers, base station manufacturers and network operators, creating new opportunities for suppliers of RF solutions. In each case, RFMD helped solve these challenges, reducing system complexity, shrinking product footprint, extending battery life and enabling more efficient delivery of mobile data.","RFMD is a leading supplier of both multimode and discrete power amplifiers, and RFMD is helping to deploy innovative new technologies like carrier aggregation and transmit MIMO, which combine independent channels of bandwidth to achieve higher data rates and help operators to monetize their spectrum investments. RFMD is also pioneering the development of new RF power management schemes like envelope tracking, which tracks and adjusts the voltage delivered to the PA in realtime to optimize efficiency and extend battery life.","Of note, we're very early in the deployment of these enabling technologies. Nearly half of the world's handsets today are still 2G and contain less than $1 of RF content. That's increasing to several dollars over a multiyear period as handsets move from 2G to 3G and from 3G to 4G.","As I said earlier, mobile data is enabled in 2 ways. The shift to next-generation air standards delivers greater modulation, while the introduction of new bands and new technologies like carrier aggregation increases bandwidth. In both cases, RFMD is a primary enabler, and our growth opportunities are expanding significantly as our content per handset goes from dimes to dollars.","Whether you look at smartphones, consumer premise equipment or network infrastructure, customers are seeking the advantages of scale and broad system-level expertise as well as comprehensive product and technology portfolios to optimize system performance and improve our efficiency. These dynamics are expanding our growth opportunities across markets, customers and products, enabling RFMD to capture increasing content in a broad set of products and further diversify our revenue base.","In the markets served by our Multi-Market Products Group, we enjoyed broad-based sequential growth and diversification through product and technology leadership. We are supporting the deployment of wireless infrastructure in China and around the world, and we expect the upgrade of 4G networks to be a multiyear expansion.","WiFi continues its healthy expansion in devices and equipment, and we are still very early in the adoption of 802.11ac. We are capturing incremental growth in automotive, home automation and other broadband connectivity applications comprising the Internet of Things. We are targeting multiple applications that leverage our advanced gallium nitride technology in networks, systems and devices.","So from a very high level, RFMD is both a primary enabler and a primary beneficiary of the exploding demand for mobile data. As the industry moves to cloud-based platforms and we target download speeds of 1 gigabyte per second, these RF connections are growing in importance, and the RF TAM is expanding accordingly.","RFMD is supplying our industry's leaders the products they need to differentiate their devices, and we are enjoying very favorable design activity. Our revenue drivers are large, multiyear opportunities, and we see sustainable, long-term, diversified growth across markets, customers and product categories. Looking into 2015 and beyond, we expect revenue growth greater than the industry and EPS growth well ahead of our revenue growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dean.","William A. Priddy","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was strong for RFMD with revenue, gross profit, operating income and earnings per share, all quarterly records. Revenue for the September quarter was up approximately 14% sequentially to $362 million. CPG revenue was $298 million, and MPG revenue was $64 million. The revenue strength was broad based and well diversified, and RFMD had 2 10% customers. RFMD is definitely benefiting from the opportunities brought by the exploding demand for mobile data.","Gross margin for the September quarter increased to 48%. That's up 90 basis points sequentially and almost 12 points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $73.8 million with G&A of $10.9 million, sales and marketing of $16.5 million and R&D of $46.4 million. Operating income for the September quarter was $100.1 million, representing approximately 28% of sales. Non-GAAP taxes were approximately $10.1 million, and net income for the quarter was $90 million or $0.30 per diluted share based on 296.5 million shares.","Moving to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled approximately $241.3 million. Cash flow from operations was $58.7 million, and free cash flow was $39.4 million. DSOs were 54.7 days, and RFMD's inventory balance of $159.2 million resulted in turns of 4.9. Net PP&E was $207.1 million, and capital expenditures during the quarter were $19.3 million with depreciation of $12.2 million and intangible amortization of $6.8 million.","Before moving to the guidance section, I'd like to make a few comments on the continued sustainability of our financial performance. Our revenue is being driven by the massive multiyear proliferation of mobile data. I feel really good about our near- and long-term growth opportunities. Our organization is excelling in driving product costs lower. Our efforts have driven improved profitability across all product segments. This intense focus on product costs will not change, and internally, the focus is only getting stronger. The entire RFMD team has come together with a goal to be the best, and the company has never been better positioned for revenue growth greater than the industry and EPS growth well ahead of our revenue growth.","Now for the non-GAAP financial outlook and business commentary. In the December 2014 quarter, RFMD expects quarterly revenue of approximately $385 million. RFMD expects gross margin to be approximately flat sequentially. RFMD expects operating expenses to be approximately flat. RFMD expects a tax rate of approximately 10% to 15%, and RFMD expects diluted EPS of approximately $0.33.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Bob for comments on our proposed combination with TriQuint.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Dean. Before we open the call up for your questions, I'll recap some of the progress we've made leading up to our proposed merger. On September 5, RFMD and TriQuint both held shareholder meetings, during which the shareholders of both companies voted overwhelmingly in favor of our proposed merger. We're very pleased with these results as they endorse our vision to create a new leader in RF.","More recently, we announced our new company name will be Qorvo, and we will begin using the ticker symbol QRVO immediately upon closing. The name Qorvo is meant to convey our combined company's ability to deliver the core technology necessary to launch our customers' next-generation designs even faster. It also represents our commitment to keeping our customers at the center of all we do.","Since announcing our proposed merger earlier this year, we have established cross-functional teams from across both organizations, and they are working seamlessly to ensure we hit the ground running. We are prepared for day 1, and we are preparing for day 100 and beyond.","With each day of planning, preparation and alignment, we are building a clearer vision of where we're going and how we will achieve our goals. We have identified multiple projects supporting our expectations for revenue, cost and expense synergies. We have staffed each project, and we have mapped the actions necessary to achieve success. We are also identifying new opportunities for growth and new avenues for diversification, giving us additional confidence in our ability to achieve our value-creation goals and deliver on our operating model.","At our customers' request, we've executed 3-way NDAs with multiple leading smartphone manufacturers. We are working together to drive higher levels of functional integration to help our customers accelerate products to market as early as next year. I am extremely proud of the progress we have made to date, which is all the more noteworthy when you consider the role RFMD and TriQuint have played to support the successful ramp of multiple new flagship devices. Regarding deal timing, we continue to anticipate the merger will close by calendar year end, and both of our organizations are fully prepared for a very successful day 1.","And with that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bob, there's been some concern about excess 3G handsets in China. I was hoping if you could, number one, give us some breakdown of what your 3G versus 4G exposure is within CPG. And Part B of that is if you could give us some color around how you see the supply and demand dynamic in China. I understand that you're more focused on content growth, but how you're seeing sort of the unit demand and supply situation there?","Steven Creviston","This is Eric. Vivek, I'll take that. First off, your question about the split of 3G versus 4G within CPG overall, that's actually pretty hard to calculate because many of our components are used for both applications in switches and power amplifiers in particular. So we don't really try to split up between 3G and 4G. Overall, 3G\/4G though is now about 90% of CPG revenues. And as you can imagine, 4G is certainly the quickest growing, so it's mixing more and more towards 4G all the time. And then within China specifically, we don't see any particular issues in terms of inventory builds. We do continue to see a strong mix shift towards 4G in that market as well. In fact, overall, we are kind of flat to down slightly in China in the last quarter but we did grow in 4G in China fairly nicely. So we're seeing the same kind of shift there and no particular concerns about inventory builds. But overall, it's a great opportunity. We think we're still in very early innings there, watching a huge subscriber base transition from 2G up to 4G over the coming years.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Very helpful, Eric. And then one question on gross margin. The trajectory has been very strong. Just near term, I'm curious why you're guiding to sequentially flat gross margin even though you expect to grow sales, I believe, around 6% or so sequentially. And then more importantly, what are the longer-term drivers from here given that you have already achieved a lot of the goals that you had set for yourself after the combination with TriQuint?","William A. Priddy","Well, we've achieved a lot of the internal goals -- I mean the goals that we had communicated externally. Internally, we continue to work hard to continue to make improvements in gross margin. I think the December quarter could be a bit of impact of mix to margins. I don't think it necessarily means that margins have peaked by any stretch. And in fact, I can put scenarios together where we could see margin improvement in the December quarter and beyond. But for now, we're saying 48% is a good number for the quarter.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And one last thing, just along those same lines. Is it fair to assume that the $150 million in cost savings that you had mentioned before is still sort of incremental to the pro forma performance we have seen so far from RFMD and TriQuint?","William A. Priddy","Yes. We have not realized any synergies yet between the TriQuint and RFMD merger, so we're very, very comfortable with the $150 million number and specifically identified all those synergies. So I would continue to put a very strong check mark in that box.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Eric, I just wanted to follow-up on that last question on your guidance for next quarter. You're not seeing an inventory build in China, but I'm wondering what your expectation is for your growth in Q4. If it's obviously, probably centered around one particular customer with another one that does a little bit of an inventory digestion. But I wonder what your expectation is for the Chinese market and some of the other OEMs.","Steven Creviston","Yes. Thanks, Mike. As you said, it's certainly -- the growth we're seeing in the December quarter is certainly led by flagship launches, new products in the very highest tier that are driving a lot of RF content. We're expecting kind of more of the same in China, again relatively flat, up in 4G but down in the others. We're not counting on growth in China to hit our guidance in December.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then realizing it's a little early to talk about the March quarter, but given your increasing exposure to one of your top customers, I'm curious how to think about seasonality in March and going forward.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Mike, this is Bob. I'll go ahead and take a shot at that. Again, a little premature to be calling the March quarter. We've got Chinese New Year a little bit later than normal and what all is going to transpire. But from a planning perspective, typically running 10% to 15% is probably not out of the norm. It all depends on how diversified the business is. Some of the marquee phones, how long they continue to be successfully received in the marketplace. I think what's also of note is that we're -- from a gross margin perspective, back to the earlier questions, we're feeling pretty good about our gross margins being able to hold up even in a down seasonal 10% to 15% in the March quarter. So when we look at it all well and all, we'll have to see how it plays out, but typically 10% to 15%.","Operator","We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First of all, congratulations, tremendous execution over the last 2 years or so, guys. Bob, I had a quick sort of question on Qorvo. The joint company will have almost all parts of the RF functions and features under one roof. Do you anticipate having that capability will dramatically increase your ability to cross-sell other parts and also give you a tremendous ability to gain share relative to the other players?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks, Harsh. Appreciate the comments. As far as Qorvo is concerned, as you pointed out, we will have the various technologies that we believe are needed in the RF front end or the handset in particular. I guess is where the question was geared towards. And we are finding opportunities where there's pieces of business that neither of the companies would go after. But when we bring the things together, again, customers are asking to sign 3-way NDAs so that we can work on product roadmaps to help them launch their products even faster in the market. So clearly, there's opportunities for us to gain share. But I think what's also most important to understand is the -- what's really driving the growth for our industry is, what I talked about, the increasing bandwidth, adding the bands and that complexity and the major shift from 2G to 3G and 3G to 4G. That's clearly what's going to drive most of the growth. But yes, there's opportunity for us to gain some share as we come together and get our product and technology roadmaps aligned.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. As my follow-up if I can ask you, what is left for legally or otherwise, what is left for the combination to take place?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","We have received the, obviously, the shareholder vote. From a U.S. regulations, we're in good shape there. We are only waiting on the China's Ministry of Commerce approval. And it's the last step in our regulatory approvals.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Dean, you saw a fairly steep increase in R&D this past quarter. I think in the past you said you were comfortable with your OpEx level and you could grow the top line without having increased it, unless of course you ran into some big design wins that would require it. Is that what we're seeing here? Is that increase tactical or strategic? And then, Bob, in the press release, you mentioned the 3-way NDAs with TriQuint and smartphone OEMs. I imagine those were executed midyear or so. Was that early enough to impact your share in content in 2015 smartphones, given the design cycles of different OEMs? Or should we expect more of a kick, if there is one, in 2016? And does that apply to all the 3-way NDAs or only to some of those? And then, Eric, you mentioned the ET shipments, which is very interesting that they're actually -- are those production, preproduction or Qual? And is this PowerSmart as in both the ET PMIC and the AMP? Or is it just the PMIC and are we going to rebrand PowerSmart to be something else? And how many basebands -- how many major basebands are you paired with there?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","All right, Ed, appreciate your question. I'll go ahead and let Eric start with it in reverse and go through the product side first. Then I'll address your 3-way NDAs, and then Dean will finish up with our expenses.","William A. Priddy","R&D. Yes.","Steven Creviston","So the question on envelope tracking shipments, those are full production. So we shipped millions of units into, again, 2 baseband -- 2 different baseband solutions into flagship phones with one customer last quarter. And this was not PowerSmart, this is new envelope tracking, power management IC. And in all cases, we also had multimode power amplifiers attached to those converters as well. So it was a nice dollar content, kind of the heartbeat of those new platforms.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","And as far as the 3-way NDAs, Ed, with multiple customers, they are for platforms in '15 and '16. And unfortunately, I can't go into too much detail with them. They are NDAs. So Dean?","William A. Priddy","Yes, Ed, the R&D expenses ticked up primarily in mass sets. And to answer your question, yes, there's -- we locked down some pretty key design wins this quarter. So feeling good about spending that money and getting the results.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about sustainability that you guys both commented on. As we look at dollar content gains, I think we saw, as you go from 2G to 3G, a doubling of the dollar content, and yet the economics of the industry didn't seem to work out that well. We're seeing at least another doubling of content here. Why is it more sustainable this time around versus the past cycle?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Sorry, Steve. I'd like you to explain a little bit more your point about the economics from 2G to 3G. I understand...","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, obviously, I mean, you've been able to get much better margins now versus in the past. So what's changed about that? And why is it more sustainable on the newer platforms versus what you had in the past, you had lower margins?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I'll let Dean talk a little bit about that, Steve. But I think if you look at maybe from an industry perspective, you're right, but we have had competitors that have enjoyed very good margins throughout this whole transition. I think what we've talked about over the last 18 months is our focus on driving cost out of our manufacturing processes and our cost of goods sold, and that's what really has started to change. That happens to coincide with the shift from 3G to 4G. But what really drove it is our work to reduce our cost.","William A. Priddy","Steve, we also have a flexible sourcing model now that we started. We have adjusted our manufacturing footprint, and Bob talked about the relentless pursuit of product cost reductions. And in -- the business units are focused now heavily on product portfolio management and design for cost initiatives. So I'd say, we're just simply using best practices to bring the best products and technologies to the market with a relentless focus on achieving the lowest possible cost structure and -- we took out $150 million of cost over the past 18 months. So that's not coming back. And so that's going to be sustainable margin performance going forward.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","The only point I'd add, Steve, and Dean's opening comments were about this. The margin in all of our products have improved, but whether that's 2G PAs, 3G or 4G components. So we have worked, as Dean pointed out, on our costs.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then people asked questions, which I think -- around China, which I think were focused specifically just on that market. But my question here is more on the Chinese handset OEMs versus just China per se. And I was curious if you could talk about how their growth looks here into the end of the year? Because obviously some of those guys don't sell just into China market. And how it might look into next year also?","Steven Creviston","This is Eric. I'll take a stab at it. I think it is interesting when you look at the dynamics in that market. In particular, the OEM structure over the course of this year, you are beginning to see more concentration around fewer, although still quite a few. So we've got 6 to 8 customers basically that make up about 2\/3 of our business there now, where historically, of course, we would have 50 to 100 probably. And so that, I think, gives you a little more visibility. They can -- they have more scale. They can afford the R&D and so forth. And I think these are the ones that are really capitalizing on the 4G transition. And again, when you look at the subscriber base there, you have 1 billion subscribers, and very few are on 4G today, 50 million maybe. And so if you look at the net adds that are being posted every month, you see the 4G net adds just continue to grow significantly month over month over month. And yet we're still at very low penetration rate. So I think you've got a handful, 6 to 10 maybe can -- very big players in China, who are going to be even more significant year-over-year for the next 3 to 5 years on that trend.","Operator","We'll go next to JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","I just wanted to go back to one of the fundamental questions about the strength that you saw in December and in -- that you're seeing in December and you saw in September. First, can you give us a sense of how much unit growth of a ramp is contributing -- contributed in September and is contributing in December versus content gains in driving those revenue numbers?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","So your question is from the handset perspective, the number of units or is it content gains? I'll let Norm talk a little bit about MPG but -- which also grew very nicely quarter-over-quarter. For what we saw in September and what we're seeing in December, it's primarily the content gains. The number of handsets have roughly been flat.","Norman A. Hilgendorf","And generally for the year, that's kind of our model. We're modeling handset units roughly flat. And then TAM growth of 10% to 15% on that based on content so...","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Sorry. I was quite -- trying to clarify the ramp that we're seeing in the flagship product this quarter relative to last quarter. And how much of that driving the revenues is coming from the unit ramp versus the content ramp?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I don't think we've modeled that out, JoAnne. I mean, clearly, if it's a new flagship that's beginning its ramp and continuing to ramp. I don't know how to answer your question from that standpoint. So what we're seeing is there are other phones that are ramping down. These are ramping up, and we're seeing handsets roughly flat. So it's dollar content from our perspective.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Fair enough. And then I did want to get to the MPG segment. Nice growth there. Can you elaborate on what's driving that? And where you see that going over the next quarter? And how much of that is coming from base station versus other activities?","Norman A. Hilgendorf","Sure. Thanks, JoAnne, this is Norm. We had really nice upticks in each of our major markets last quarter. WiFi was up more than 20% year-over-year. Wireless infrastructure stayed strong on the back of LTE buildouts in China. Cable TV had a nice pickup last quarter as well. So in each of our major areas, we had some nice increases. We also had some nice pickups in smaller categories, such as our GaN category with some radar products and foundry. And SmartEnergy was also up nicely. So really across the board, we had a very nice performance in all of our key markets. Looking forward to the next quarter, we do see some typical seasonality when I look at what -- how MPG has performed over the last -- the 3 prior fiscal years. We've had quarterly -- quarter declines in the December quarter anywhere from 6% to 10% kind of average decline, and we're expecting that as well in the coming quarter. Wireless infrastructure we expect to stay strong. We don't foresee any declines there, and we foresee pickups there, increases in calendar 2015, as we have a number of exciting new products that we just rolled out that are ramping in the March quarter for wireless infrastructure. So for the coming quarter, I do see, especially if you look at our -- some of our broad-based product areas such as our standard catalog products, the current economic concerns that people have around the world I think are affecting us in -- and some of our market categories for the December quarter. So we will see some impact on that in December.","Operator","We'll go next to Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Back to this 3-way NDAs and the potential for some product next year. What milestones do you need now to get a better sense of the revenue synergies you can get with the TriQuint combination? And have you thought about the format that you could potentially share that with investors?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","As far as being able to share with investors, we typically don't try to telegraph our competition where we're working and where we're focused, so I want to be careful about that. I think as we get into the Analyst Day on the 18th, I think you'll hear Eric and James both talk about how we're bringing together the product and technology portfolios in the product segments that we're chasing. But I don't think you're going to hear us be that specific in calling our shots and drawing attention so that our competition can go react to that. So I want to be very careful in that, but...","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I guess at this point, I mean, you are more confident in seeing some revenue synergies with the combination? That's something you didn't call for it.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","That's correct. I think, again, as we spend more time understanding where each other was heading and product segments that we didn't go after that now when we look at bringing together the 2 companies, clearly our large customers today have really recognized the value in bringing together the 2 companies. And that's why we're signing 3-way NDAs with them. So it's really the big guys driving a lot of that, but we do have other product areas that we're chasing. So Eric, do you want to give maybe a little more color.","Steven Creviston","Yes. I guess, I would say that what it's really about is how to drive the industry faster. That's what these NDAs are about. The industry is trying to figure out how to cram more and more data throughput into these mobile devices, into smaller area and at lower power consumption. And they see the opportunity that Qorvo will have with all of the technologies in-house to maybe advance that faster than the industry was planning before. So rather than thinking about it as discrete products and discrete product segments, I think, think of it much more about how we can work with customers to drive the industry faster.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And then my follow-up is the implications of Intel having a stake in Spreadtrum. Any implications on the reference design activity with Spreadtrum? I know cooperation is mostly on the apps processor side, but perhaps Spreadtrum might need some help on the baseband side. Any implications there?","Steven Creviston","I wouldn't say there's a dramatic impact. I would say we've got great relationships with both Intel and Spreadtrum. And if this helps either or both be healthier and grow faster, it's good for us.","Operator","We'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Krysten Sciacca - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","This is Krysten Sciacca in for Quinn Bolton. Are you seeing any activity in India for an LTE base station buildout in calendar 2015?","Norman A. Hilgendorf","This is Norm. I would have to say that for -- from what we're seeing right now, we do not see a lot of activity, a lot of energy going into that today. There is certainly some activity. I've seen a lot more on the China LTE buildouts. And -- but everybody is expecting that India will be hot on the heels of China in building out LTE infrastructure because there's a large subscriber base there that's going to want the same benefits of 4G.","Krysten Sciacca - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to China, if that segment was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter but the 4G business grew sequentially, what attributed to the weakness in that geographic segment?","Steven Creviston","Yes. We're continuing to see the roll-off of 2G essentially. And some of that is converting to 3G, but most of it's converting directly to 4G.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on Bob's earlier answer mentioning gross margins holding up despite the revenue decline. Dean, you continue to impress us there. Where do you expect gross margins to go longer term for RFMD stand-alone? You mentioned publicly the possibility of 50%. Is that a longer-term target, say, 2 years? Or can you talk to us about kind of a path to get there from here?","William A. Priddy","Yes. Mike, I think I might have mentioned a 50% margin targeted at your conference and we have very clear -- RFMD has very clear line of sight to 50% gross margin. And it's not beyond the less than 1-year planning horizon.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for Eric, on RF Fusion, you mentioned in the press release some new customer engagements there. Can you recap where we are on the product cycle? How many OEM wins and the shipment level trajectory?","Steven Creviston","Yes, sure. It's along the lines of what we've been talking about today of driving the industry forward faster and the opportunities of bringing higher levels of integration with Fusion, where we integrate multiple power amplifiers, switches and all the filtering into single placement. So we're seeing really 2 categories for that now. We're engaged in multiple OEMs in both of these categories. One is where we really are doing kind of an all-in-one, where you have a relatively modest number of frequency bands and you want to put those all into one placement, sort of a mid-tier approach applies very well in China, for example. And so we're engaged with several OEMs to bring handsets to market using kind of all-in-one front-end solutions based on Fusion. The other category is where we're using Fusion for very high-end applications where there's many, many bands coming in the future. And generally, those are being put into groups where we'll have multiple Fusions, so multiple fully integrated modules for different bands. And there, as well, we've got several large OEMs we're working with to architect those solutions. They do take a little longer to bring to market. Obviously, these are very complex solutions. You have to really plan very well at the feature set that you're going to enable, which carrier aggregation modes, for example, and so forth. And so it does take a little longer to bring these to market, and we see the application for it. We see a lot of excitement for it, but it's going to take some time to kind of grow into it. We still believe production shipments in the March quarter are likely.","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Maybe one more question here on the model. So it looks like -- you mentioned earlier you did about $150 million of cost cutting over the last 18 months and another $150 million of synergies to come after the acquisition is complete. I'm curious, how much of that had to do with excess capacity? And wondering if now with this really robust market some of that capacity is necessary once again?","William A. Priddy","Yes. When I look at the synergy opportunity, the 2 biggest items will be the fact that when the 2 companies merge, since RFMD currently outsources all of its filters, we'll be insourcing, if you will. There's a tremendous benefit there of margin stacking. And likewise, on the assembly side, RFMD currently does most of its assembly in-house, where TriQuint currently outsources most of its assembly. We'll be bringing that all in-house. So those 2 are really, really big items. And obviously, we'll be looking at the manufacturing footprint though. And I think it's too early to make any calls there. I mean, we're looking at a growth-oriented environment for the next several years. So it's way too early to be talking about changing the manufacturing footprint. But we will cut the rug to fit the room. So those are some of the big things, at least on the COGS side. And we've got several other things on the expense side as well. Like I said, all specifically identified and...","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So for some of the cost cutting you've done internally over the past 18 months, the capacity related ones you don't feel are necessary at this point? Or the improving market hasn't required you to maybe build some back up?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","I think what's interesting, maybe if we just step way back, if you look at over this transition where we've added capacity is in assembly and test, as Dean pointed out in our China operations. And what we took out was GaAs capacity, and we replaced it with silicon that we buy on the outside, whether that's SOI, silicon germanium, or CMOS. As you know, we use silicon technologies that have really been replacing the GaAs. So from a GaAs fab perspective and utilization, we really haven't seen much uptick over the last few quarters. So our margin improvement has come from where we started the conversation earlier was truly driving cost out of our manufacturing.","Operator","And we'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","A couple questions here for Dean, if I could. The flat gross margin guide's on a higher mix of CPG revenue in December. Does that suggest your amplifier revenue will increase in CPG over SOI? Because I thought that the margin profile of SOI was closer to MPG so that a big increase in the mix toward CPG on switches and antenna tuners wouldn't hurt that much. And if I could get the split between CPG and MPG on the quarter because it sounds like they both -- they grew well? And then I have a follow-up for Eric.","William A. Priddy","Yes. I mentioned in the opening remarks that MPG was $64 million and CPG was the remainder of the $362 million. And Norm did mention that he expected MPG would be down some in the December quarter. So I mentioned that mix was the primary driver for the relatively flat margin. And it is possible that we'll also have some product sales that have a little more outsource content, which actually from a going-forward standpoint that may actually be a synergy going forward. So it's more of a near-term event.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Okay. And then, Eric, you mentioned that China was flat. Was that a unit or a revenue content -- comment? And could you remind us ASPs for your ET solution, where those fall? And then I have a question on antenna finish.","Steven Creviston","So China was actually flat to down slightly, I said in September quarter. And that was $1 revenue comment. And I'm sorry, I can't comment on the pricing of the ET converter. There's very few of them in the market now, so very few solutions that are proven and shipping, and so the pricing is not that well established yet.","Operator","And our last question comes from Cody Acree of Ascendiant Capital.","Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Last night, TriQuint made a quick mention of some supply constraints in RF SOI, just wondering if you're seeing anything similar.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","This is Bob. I'm going to take that. I think the whole industry has seen some constraints in SOI. And I think we commented on this a little bit last quarter that the supply chain side of our team has done an outstanding job of keeping up with it on the sales and working with customers. The industry is tight. I think it's typical of when we ramp up for a strong December, and then brace for the decline in March that we typically see of 10% to 15%. The industry continues to add capacity of SOI. RFMD continues to grow the amount of production that we get out of that capacity, so I feel good about that. But I'd say, it was more of an industry perspective.","Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And with the shifts with IBM planning to make a change to GlobalFoundries, are you expecting any impact on that supply base?","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Obviously, it'll be time until that transaction closes. From our discussions with both parties, we feel very good about our position with them. We embrace the transaction. We think it's great for the industry, great for -- RFMD was one of their largest customers out of the facilities that we operate for SOI, in particular. All-in-all, we see it as a very positive sign for the industry and the continued expansion of SOI.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth","Thanks for joining us this evening. RFMD is a primary beneficiary of the exploding demand for mobile data, and our growth opportunities are expanding significantly as our content and customers' devices goes from dimes to dollars. We are confident in delivering revenue growth ahead of our underlying markets, gross margin at the top of our industry, robust operating leverage and EPS growth that's well ahead of our revenue growth.

Q3 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, VP of IR. Please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much. Hello everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website at qorvo.com under Investors. In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up.","Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group, as well as other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Hello and welcome everyone. I'm happy to report Qorvo's fiscal 2017 quarterly financial results. Revenue for the quarter was approximately $825 million. That's a significant increase of 33% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our integrated solutions and highly differentiated discrete components.","We hit our gross margin target increasing 150 basis points sequentially. OpEx was 19% of sales, better than our long-term model. And EPS was $1.35, a company record and at the high end of our provided range.","The December quarter featured multiple business achievements for Qorvo. We supported the launch of the world's marquee smartphones and leading China-based OEMs, and delivered record quarterly revenue in IDP, driven by WiFi, defense, infrastructure, Internet of Things, and other growth markets. We did this while qualifying cutting-edge technologies for top customer programs, introducing over 100 new products and achieving key milestones on operational initiatives.","I'm extremely proud of what the team delivered to position Qorvo for anticipated double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2018. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved breakthrough performance in our BAW filter resonator performance, and now we are competing on the most complex BAW-based product opportunities.","Our BAW 5 process achieves a 40% increase in Q factor for improved insertion loss and a 20% increase in coupling factor to provide wider bandwidths. We now expect sales of BAW-based products will increase from less than a third of Mobile revenue in fiscal 2018 to approaching 40% in fiscal year 2019. These products will include discrete BAW placements as well as highly integrated front-end integrating BAW and, in some cases, BAW and SAW.","Looking more closely at Mobile, our new BAW 5 process delivers exceptional performance improvements, which our team began working on more than a year ago. The results are clear. Our resonators are now on par or better than anything available from anyone in the industry today. We validated this to our internal benchmarking as well as through key customer feedback.","We released a number of solutions utilizing our BAW 5 process in December, including multiplexers and RF Fusion for cellular and WiFi. We commenced sampling and received our first BAW 5 production orders for a key handset design win for our RF Fusion for Mobile WiFi.","Qorvo's RF Fusion for Mobile WiFi solutions combined our industry-leading BAW coexistence filters with our WiFi PAs, switches and LNAs. We believe RF Fusion for WiFi will be disruptive to today's costly SiP architectures and smartphones, as carriers introduce License Assisted Access or LAA. Qorvo is a leader in coexist filters and LAA requires additional coexist filtering in 5 gigahertz band.","We're also forecasting strong growth for RF Fusion for cellular across all frequencies. During the quarter, we secured multiple design wins for complete RF front-end systems combining low, mid and high-band RF Fusion placements in support of smartphones and connected devices. These solution sales command up to $10 of Qorvo content and we expect them to represent an increasing percentage of Mobile revenue, given customer design activity and the breadth of our product portfolio.","We've also secured a mid-band RF Fusion win in support of a flagship smartphone ramping this year. For the high band, our solutions operate up to the ultra high-band 42 (06:03). That is a clear competitive strength that's supported by our recently launched GaAs HBT5 process, which we believe delivers the industry's best performance.","Finally, it's worth highlighting our move into diversity receive modules. With the proliferation of carrier aggregation, the diversity receive market is growing rapidly. Historically, this market has been served by SAW and more recently temp-comp SAW. However, customer designs are calling for enhanced performance and smaller system-level solutions and this favors the breadth of our filter portfolio, as well as our technology leadership in high pro count switches.","Customer requirements are increasingly favoring performance, integration, and system-level optimization and we see no company better positioned to satisfy the market. Frankly, our challenge isn't can we compete, it's where do we compete. We build a business that best serves where the industry is headed. We've got the right products. We're investing in innovation to expand our technology moat and we're enhancing productivity through a culture of lean and continuous improvement.","We've moved GaN products from Greensboro to Richardson to consolidate GaN fabrication in Richardson. We migrated new GaAs-based designs from Greensboro to Hillsboro and we brought up our newest GaAs process, HBT5.","We are well on our way in our transition from 6 to 8-inch BAW and from 4 to 6-inch temp-comp SAW and we have begun work on significantly reducing filter die sizes in both SAW and BAW. Finally, we're continuing to add state-of-the-art assembly and test capacity in our facility in DeZhou, China.","Turning to Infrastructure and Defense, Qorvo continued to connect and protect in the December quarter across high growth markets, including IoT smart home, automotive, GaN for Defense, GaN for base stations, optical transport and WiFi. We're enjoying broad-based growth since we repositioned our portfolio focus into higher-growth segments where differentiated products create value for our customers.","We're benefiting from our broad market exposure, scale advantages and extensive portfolio of internally developed technologies, which we use to drive differentiation versus our competition. IDP continues to establish winning positions in high-growth segments with differentiated product offerings in radar, electronic warfare, base station and WiFi. Customers are increasingly looking for higher levels of integration and IDP continues to pace the industry with product releases that address the needs across the market.","In base stations, we're focused on high-growth opportunities like the implementation of massive MIMO and the transition to GaN technology. This includes Qorvo's GaN high-powered PAs for ultra high band 42 (09:09) and 3.5 gigahertz, which we're shipping in production today.","In 5G, we announced last week that Qorvo was the first RF solution supplier to join China Mobile's 5G Innovation Center. Qorvo is unique in our combined leadership in mobile devices and infrastructure applications and this positions us to accelerate the creation and delivery of market-leading 5G solutions.","We are also a full voting member of the 3GPP standards body advising on 5G RF solutions. We supported dozens of 5G field trials with global infrastructure providers and we expect to be a critical link in the seamless connection of billions of things to deep cloud-based computing power and advanced analytics.","As next-generation 5G networks are deployed, we see expanding opportunities for growth. Autonomous vehicles will generate and receive massive quantities of data. Every home appliance will be a candidate for connectivity and individuals will live increasingly connected. Qorvo is strategically positioned to be both an enabler and a beneficiary of the explosive growth in data by delivering the broadest range of 5G connectivity solutions.","In WiFi, as I indicated earlier, we released our next-generation of integrated front-ends. Key to our success on the enterprise and retail side, we launched a broad family of new 802.11ac FEMs enabling smaller, more efficient routers, gateways and other network devices.","For the smart home and IoT, we introduced the industry's first multi-protocol SoC to integrate ZigBee 3.0, Thread and Bluetooth Low Energy protocols in a single chip for sensors and actuators throughout the home.","We also announced the partnership with ubisys to deliver the first IoTivity platform on a multi-chip radio. Through this partnership, Qorvo will help simplify wireless communications across various devices by integrating a ZigBee 3.0 and Green Power-based smart home network within the IoTivity framework.","During the quarter, IDP enjoyed broad-based design win activity, highlighted by a complete RF solution win with content above $5 at a leading WiFi router OEM. Multiple GaN wins for radar, electronic warfare and wireless infrastructure and the adoption of BAW filters in automotive applications.","Looking forward, as 5G field trials and Pre-5G deployment gains traction, the move to phased-array architectures and emphasis on broader bandwidth and higher frequency will favor Qorvo's comprehensive family of GaN PAs. Across all of IDP's diversified markets, we are releasing new products at an aggressive pace and we're building a broad-based pipeline of highly differentiated solutions with long production tails.","IDP is a double-digit growth business that's highly diversified and is closing in quickly on our target model of 30% operating margin. It's among the largest in its peer group and is consistently generating superior financial results. Essentially, it's a diversified analog company operating within Qorvo.","In March, the impact of a few customer delays on revenue can't dampen our enthusiasm for fiscal year 2018. Qorvo has won significant share on these flagship programs and we expect to benefit as the programs roll out. Current expectations are for these builds to begin in March and hit significant volume in the June quarter.","In fiscal year 2018, we expect double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by continued broad-based growth in IDP and increasing demand for our Mobile Products, including multiplexers, diversity receive modules, WiFi, RF Fusion and RF Flex. We're also forecasting year-over-year content gains in marquee smartphones, driven by low-band PADs, envelope trackers and tuners.","In closing, I'm extremely proud of what the team delivered in the December quarter to position us for anticipated double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2018.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo delivered a strong December quarter of exceptional growth, higher gross margin consistent with our guidance, lower-than-expected OpEx, and EPS at the top of our range. Qorvo's third quarter non-GAAP revenue of $825 million increased 33% or $206 million year-over-year on strong handset RF content and broader market growth. We had two 10% customers in the quarter, the largest at approximately 37% of revenue and the other, Huawei, at approximately 11%.","Mobile Products revenue increased 34% year-over-year on content growth, a low-band PAD ramp and strong Asia customer demand. IDP revenue increased 29% year-over-year to a record $169 million on growth in wireless infrastructure, WiFi, defense, IoT and other markets. Qorvo's robust growth in the quarter and year-to-date reflects our strong technology position, broad market product portfolio and growing supply capabilities. We expect our technology and product pipeline to continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2018.","Gross margin in the December quarter was 44.3%, a sequential increase of 150 basis points and reflecting improved manufacturing yields. We expect gross margin to further improve in the March quarter on seasonal mix effects and ongoing productivity and quality efforts. Operating expenses were better than expected in the quarter at $157 million on lower development expenses and personnel costs. We achieved better-than-model OpEx at 19% of sales and expect cost reduction activities now underway to sustain model or better performance in fiscal year 2018.","Operating income for the quarter was approximately $209 million or 25.3% of sales, a 250 basis point sequential improvement on higher gross margin and lower OpEx. Non-GAAP net income was $177 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.35, at the top-end of our guidance range and up 31% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $220 million on income growth and lower working capital. Inventory turns remained near historic highs with days of inventory at 79. DSOs improved to 46 days. Capital expenditures were $137 million in the quarter, principally addressing the need to support projected premium filter demand, particularly BAW.","As Bob mentioned, we expect BAW-based products to increase from less than a third of Qorvo's Mobile business in fiscal year 2018 to approaching 40% in fiscal year 2019, as performance requirements and the need for integrated modules increase. Free cash flow was $84 million and cash at quarter-end increased to $496 million. We returned $67 million to shareholders under our recently announced $500 million repurchase program. We intend to continue buying as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.","Now, let's turn to our outlook. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue of between $610 million and $650 million, gross margin of approximately 46%, tax rate of 8% and diluted EPS between $0.70 and $0.90. This guidance primarily reflects a greater than historical sequential decline in the March quarter, as two of our leading customers in China and a Tier 1 customer in Korea delayed flagship smartphone launches. The increase in gross margin is consistent with earlier guidance. OpEx is forecasted to be up less than 5% sequentially on development program timing and seasonal payroll effects.","We expect CapEx for fiscal year 2017 to total around $500 million, down from earlier estimates. Looking out to the June quarter, we currently are forecasting normal seasonal sequential growth. As we move past June through fiscal year 2018, we expect revenue to strengthen as new programs launch and plan to end the year with double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. We expect this double-digit growth, along with increased BAW-based product mix, higher utilization rates, and ongoing productivity and quality improvements, will help us achieve 50% gross margin exiting fiscal year 2018.","We expect OpEx efficiency to continue to improve and project OpEx to be below 20% of sales for the year. Hitting our operating model of 30% operating margin remains our objective during fiscal year 2018. Our non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be below \u2013 remain below 10%. CapEx spend will remain elevated in fiscal 2018, but is expected to be down from previous estimates to around $400 million. With double-digit revenue growth, expanding gross margins, improving OpEx efficiency and lower CapEx, we expect free cash flow to double from fiscal year 2017 to 2018.","In summary, we delivered on our financial commitments during the December quarter. We also made progress on positioning the company for growth and margin expansion. We validated our core BAW technology and design capabilities for the market's most complex integrated modules. With our premium filters, PAs, ETP mix, switches and other device capabilities, and our packaging technologies, we're positioned to address the widest range of advanced mobile applications. With our PAs and BAW filters, we expect our iFEM products to allow us to grow above market in WiFi.","Our position in GaN is providing us opportunities in a number of other high growth IDP markets. We believe we are well positioned to address where the markets are headed. Operationally, we continue to make progress on yield improvements, wafer size conversions, capacity rationalizations, sourcing initiatives and other productivity efforts to drive margin expansion. We are focused on achieving strong revenue growth, improving operating leverage and driving free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go first to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, this is Kulin Patel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned a delay with three of your major customers for flagships. Are we expecting them to ramp in the June quarter and is it fair to assume that June should be up strongly, potentially up double-digit year-over-year?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, as far as the \u2013 my opening comments, what I talked about was the flagship phones will begin to ramp in March, but they're really going to be in high volume in the June quarter. So, you have to see if the amount that we're going to be up in the June quarter, but again, we do expect those phones to launch late in the March quarter, but really hit high volume in the June quarter.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And my follow-up, you mentioned BAW will be one third of Mobile in fiscal 2018. How much is it in the fiscal 2017?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Eric. BAW content in the Mobile Products Group was just under 30% of revs in FY 2017.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. Mark, I was wondering if \u2013 you had given a bridge for gross margins that spanned out several quarters into the future. You talked a little bit about it in the commentary. I was wondering if those rough guidelines are still intact for basically June and September and beyond to get back to 50%.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, they are, Harsh. And we gain confidence, of course, that we hit our target in the third quarter. What happened we thought would happen. We were up about 250 basis points related to the yield improvements and better quality performance, and then we lost a bit on mix. So, we were up net 150 basis points. As to our projection to the fourth quarter, we're going to pick up about 100 basis points associated with better mix, principally lower low-band PAD volumes, and then we think we're going to get about another 50 basis points on cost-related activities. So, again, up just north of 150 basis points to 46%. And then on a \u2013 looking out, Harsh, to the June, September, December, March quarters, in the June quarter, we're thinking probably in the \u2013 between 46.5%, 47%; closer to 48% mid-fiscal year; and then again our target is to be around 50% exiting the year.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then, as a follow-up, Bob, if I can ask you, just going back to the previous question because I think that's the big issue today with the stock, why \u2013 if these phones will ramp in June in full volume, roughly when would you start to ship these products to these customers timing wise? What is the lead time here and why would you not see a large balloon-up, if you will, in the June timeframe?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. So, we'll begin shipping components into these during this quarter, just much later in the quarter than we had anticipated into March. And so, then the growth in June, we do expect overall and in our China business in particular to recover nicely in the June quarter.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, I think, Harsh, to add a little more color to that, what we're saying is I do expect significant growth in the June quarter. I also think we're being a little bit cautious on one of our larger customers. To reemphasize what Eric said, we're pretty bullish on our China customers and what's going on there. I think it's quite well-known our Korean customer and what's on their plate (26:12) out there, I think we're being a little bit conservative. But we do expect June to see significant growth quarter-over-quarter.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Very helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks guys for taking my question. And maybe just to follow-up there, maybe give us a range of what you would consider normal seasonality. If we go back last four years, I think you've been anywhere from up 4% to up 26% in the June quarter. So, maybe a little narrowing down, if you could.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Cody, I would say \u2013 and this is Mark. In the June quarter, we would say March to June up to 10%, between 7% to 10%.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And then, I guess also with your Korean customer, your larger competitor had made some comments that a ramp at that same customer would have a positive effect in the March quarter, offsetting some of their normal seasonality. I guess can you help us maybe square the comments with what you're seeing today?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure can, yeah. This is Eric. I think we all know that the delay of the new flagship is out there and the timing is a little uncertain there. I think we have a bit of a company-specific issue in that the North America SKU of the legacy model, which was intended to backfill that, was heavily based on Qorvo content. We have a lot of dollar content on that particular SKU, and the fact is the backfill has not been happening. So, that particular SKU of the legacy platform has been reduced considerably more than the other SKUs basically. So, we're disproportionately affected by that, while waiting for the new launch to take place.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I see. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I was wondering if you can tell us, as far as the total Chinese smartphone OEM market, what was that as a percentage of revenue in the most recent quarter? And going forward in this calendar year 2017, where do you think it can grow to?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Mark, do you want to handle at least what it was this quarter?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. For China, ex-Huawei, it's less than 40% in the quarter. And if you go on, I'll get more specific numbers.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. And for Mobile, of course, yeah, so it's in the 30% range for the December quarter results, and we see that being flat to down as a percentage slightly in the March outlook.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And then for the year, I think it's a little too soon to call, because now you're asking us to guesstimate how well some of the marquee phones are going to do. But if your question is, do we believe we can grow in China in this calendar year, the answer is absolutely.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then overall how's the inventory look in the China channel for mobile?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. We don't see any particular concern there, other than these models that the ramp has been delayed on. So, of course, there's inventory that's sitting there waiting to ramp these phones. But otherwise, it's nothing of concern.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you, Vince.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Vince.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the Korean customer, and wondering if you could talk about any potential content gains on that platform, as it ramps late March into the June quarter?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, I think if you're referring to generation-over-generation platform gains, we're kind of expecting stability there amongst all the RF suppliers for the most part. So, it will depend about SKU to SKU maybe, but overall we think it's pretty stable.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","So, your content \u2013 dollar content gen-to-gen is flat or your market share or share of content is stable relative to your competitors, but grows with the new generation? Just trying to clarify.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I was referring to share between the competitors (30:45).","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","So, you should grow with the overall content in that phone?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","That's right.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Correct.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. And then, the second question, just obviously you guys had used outsourced SAW filters in the low-band PAD this current generation. Wondering if you could give us any update on where you are in terms of ramping that SAW capacity. You mentioned the ramp of the 6-inch wafers in Florida. Are you going to get that production qualified and think you can source internally those SAW filters for low-band PADs here in calendar 2017?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Let me try and answer this the best way I can, Quinn. We're making very good progress on qualifying what we're bringing up in 6-inch in Greensboro. In fact, we talked about bringing up the (31:29) SAW there for customer shipments. So, we're making very good progress on that. We are starting to in-source filters that we had bought externally and they'll be in production most likely next year, 2018.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","In high volume. We'll have some volume in 2017, but the real margin improvement that we want to see is going to be 2018.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","And just, Vince (sic) [Quinn], to tie off on that one question for you, the Mobile business, China, ex-Huawei, is 30%. And as I mentioned, Huawei is an 11% customer. So, it's 41% in Mobile ex or...","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Including.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","...including Huawei.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Just following up on the China customer delay, any read-through there on that market? Is it taking a pause? Is there anything from an inventory kind of burn through before they launch new products?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","It's always a tricky time to talk about China when you're right in the middle of the Lunar New Year cycle. So, we'll know a lot more here in a couple more weeks when people come back and we see what the sell-through was. But in this particular case, we had two handset models, one with each of two of our largest customers. One had a critical component that had a supply shortage and delayed the ramp. The other one had a qualification issue. Both were non-RF-related and certainly not related to us. But they're just the kind of things that happen. They happen to be units that have a lot of RF content that we had the majority of and the sort of volumes that run into millions a month. So, it created a bit of a hole in the March quarter.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for the color there. And then as my follow-up, on the diversity receive side, you guys really haven't played there to-date. So, just kind of if you can give a little bit more context in terms of what's changing and your visibility into the type of business that you can do on that front.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. It's a very exciting product category for the industry, of course, and we have had some success there in a flagship phone last year. We basically have that choice of where to compete. We've got so many opportunities in BAW-based and even SAW-based power amplifier and integrated RF Fusion projects and we haven't really kind of dove in with both feet on the diversity receive module, but it is a $1.5 billion industry and growing at least as fast as the rest of the mobile TAM.","And the shift we are seeing is really a need for higher performance in that category as our customers put even higher band counts in their phone and more carrier aggregation. There is a need for higher performance diversity modules and I think that's where we've got an opportunity.","So, we're again going at it in a bit of a metered pace, because we do have a lot of opportunities to invest in, but picking and choosing the areas we think we can differentiate with performance and in particular bring our BAW filter technology into the diversity module and in some cases, we'll have diversity modules with a mix of SAW and BAW as well to optimize for various market opportunities. So, we're very excited about it and we'll begin to see traction in FY 2018. I think FY 2019 is when it will become more meaningful.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Caso with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes, thank you. Question is regarding the gross margin target and I guess you guys have talked about where you expect to be at varied points during the year. Could you talk about what steps you need to take in order to get there and I guess specifically, how dependent is that 50% target on revenue growth in getting some leverage on the higher revenue?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, fortunately not much has changed in our view. Last quarter, we gave it a walk and the initiatives that we were undertaking continue and will continue through the end of fiscal year 2018. So, what I said last quarter was about 100 basis points we get from wafer diameter and other manufacturing yield-related issues, about 150 basis points from utilization-related benefits and that has some to do with volume, obviously and the rationalizations we're doing in the plants. And then, about 150 basis points associate with supply chain and other productivity initiatives. And that's largely the same roadmap for the expansion now. It's a bit more balanced across the three now than it was, but largely the same, Chris.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","The other thing I'd point out, gross margins are guided to go up and revenues are down to support what Mark is talking about.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. As a follow-up, you talked in the past your BAW fabs have been underutilized, but BAW is increasing as a percentage of the total now. As you exit the year and you hit what I think you said was 40% target for BAW, what does that do to the utilization rates of the BAW fabs?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, the 40% is in fiscal year 2019, but we expect the BAW-related fab, which is Richardson 6-inch and 8-inch to be over 80% in fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2018. Currently, it's closer to 50%, 60% and so, we expect that to expand. And we're actually \u2013 yeah, there were some developments through the quarter to figure out how to optimize the capital spend and customer ramps and so forth and we're actually able to do a conversion to 8-inch faster than we expected. And as a result, the CapEx profile will be a bit less in the short term and the need for Farmers Branch will be pushed out a bit.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks a lot. First, Eric, you were talking about DRx box (38:29) and you have played there very sparingly and only used BAW. It sounds like you know \u2013 is it primarily still going to be a BAW game for you and you augment it with SAW as necessary and why the big change here? Is it upload carrier aggregation doing this or is it the lot of phones moving to more modules from discrete? You seem to be busier than all get out on the \u2013 all the other products, too. So, attacking this market seems like might be (38:52) asking more than to maybe have engineering capacity for.","And then you mentioned, Mark, you mentioned that you're running about 56% BAW, are you still adding capacity Farmers \u2013 to Richardson and do you expect it to layer on much more as you go through the year or do you think you're good for the year as it stands right now?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Hey, Eric, take the first part.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Ed. Again, we simply are seeing a drive towards \u2013 really it's the proliferation of a carrier aggregation modes into the open market in particular, where customers want to go to market fast with a lot of different versions. And we believe that we can help a lot with the loss in the front-end especially in the carrier agg mode with the BAW filters. Although, in some of those applications, not every single band has to have BAW and in some cases SAW might be better suited. So, we'll use that to complement, as you said, the BAW. And you're right, we have a lot of opportunities without even doing the diversity receive, but there's several places where I think with the BAW differentiation it just makes sense to do it to help the customers' performance.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And, Ed, your question on BAW capacity, we will continue to add capacity as planned. Mark commented that we throttled some of that back through some of the things that we've decided to do through the last quarter on how to get the capacity in place going to 8-inch faster, but again as we commented in the \u2013 or I commented in my opening comments about how much we expect our BAW-based revenue to grow in FY 2019, which is really calendar year 2018. We pretty much have to have that in place and qualify up on 8-inch this year. So, we're going to continue to build that out to support revenues in calendar 2018.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","To that end, Bob, nobody assigns design wins a year ahead of the actual production and you're talking out more than the year. So, is it safe to assume that a lot of your projections on BAW or everything that you're seeing with carrier aggregation and even the white-box in China is starting to move much more complicated front-ends? Driving demand for open market, BAW whether discrete or modules is that what's making you so optimistic about here or do you just see product roadmaps in some of your larger customers just pulling a lot more of this product in? You think with the new BAW 5, you're going to be more competitive?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's both, Ed. Really our largest customers, but in particular maybe the open market is where we see the fastest growing part of that segment. And we're just really thrilled with the performance of the BAW 5 and especially in the higher order multiplexing sort of applications, but also in WiFi.","We mentioned LAA coming in WiFi. We know that's a couple of years off, but people are already beginning to think hard about that and that's really going to drive significant increase in BAW content even for WiFi there in the 5 gig band. So, just an awful lot of opportunities. We've got great technology now in a lot of places to take it.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Your largest customer \u2013 your largest competitor in BAW has excess capacity, I would say significant relative what they've had in the past here. Are you seeing them in China, whether it is the China, Inc., the big boys there or white box or is it still pretty much your market in BAW? And just to touch again, DRx, are you going to offer any DRx products that don't use BAW?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, let's answer first one first. We don't see any significant change in the competitive dynamics in the BAW market with our largest competitor there. I think it's status quo and we've got the opportunity to take the enhanced technology out and go in several directions with it.","So then, the second question was about the DRx module. Again, the roadmap is not firm. I don't want to rule anything out. It is possible we could do some that don't have BAW in them, but given our resource constraint, as you said, it makes sense to focus on areas with the highest differentiation.","I would say, the other aspect here is that we are moving towards full system solutions at a lot of cases in which we've got the majority, if not all of the mainline content. And so, when we're in those positions, customers are happy to bolt on diversity receive in other items from us like WiFi. So, these opportunities are kind of disproportionately easier to capture maybe once we have the rest of the full solution. That's probably another dynamic change that you're seeing in terms of why we're getting more excited about DRx now.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Just maybe a comment, add a bit on this capacity on BAW. So as I mentioned, between 50%, 60% now, we expect to be around 80%, you know, by this time next year and next calendar year, March quarter of 2018. And a few things that the migration from 6-inch to 8-inch, as I mentioned we figured out some things to do there that we can increase capacity with \u2013 more efficiently. And it's allowed us to push out the Farmers Branch tool installs.","And then, there's just a wide range of customer opportunities on BAW that will diversify the revenue and allow us to better load what capacity we do have. Diversity receive, as Eric mentioned, increased use of BAW in WiFi. There is, of course, a large customer socket opportunities and then \u2013 which are more BAW intensive. And, of course, there is even faster-growing market for BAW in China, which we're very well positioned. So, feeling great about the technology and where it stands and the capacity plan associated with it.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","My apologies. Last question, I'll get back in the queue. So, this time next year, I'm sure we'll be talking about upload carrier aggregation a lot more given the impact this is going to have on the front end there. It would seem to be the case given the power requirements and the ET requirements, et cetera, on this that your hand would be strengthened as we move into that. I'm sure you're looking at those designs right now actually competing for these designs since they'll be in production next year. So, how does that look preliminarily here? Is it a narrower market for suppliers because of the power thing or does that still going to be off board and not really affect who you're seeing in competition for those slots?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I think it absolutely narrows the field and it's not just upload carrier aggregation. We're seeing move to higher frequency bands. We're getting out to an early lead in the ultra high band, band 42 space as well with the advanced Gallium Arsenide. We're seeing LNAs become more important across the board because of all of that complexity as well. So, we've got some technology there and our tuners, especially as we go to advanced antenna systems and potentially 4x4 MIMO and so forth, our tuner content continues to be a very key asset for us and very differentiated. All of these things come together and as customers look for suppliers to provide more and more of the entire RF front-end system and more of those differentiators, you have the better.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Bob, I just wanted to revisit this roughly $90 million or so delta between the midpoint of your outlook and what the consensus expectations were, especially because that's such a big contrast with one of your peers who raised their outlook for March.","Now, from what I heard on the call, there were three factors. One was not backfilling the U.S. SKU for your large Korean customer, second was China, third was delay in the new Korean phone. I know we're getting a bit granular, but is there a way to help us understand these three different factors, especially what can come back in June and where there is still some uncertainty? I just want to make sure I get it right as to what are these company-specific factors versus sort of market-specific factors.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Vivek, I'll give you a little more high level again and allow Eric to add some more color. And number one, when we look at things at a very high level trying to compare us to any one competitor given our current product mixes and different phones we go after and different marquee phone launches, if you really look at the last three or four quarters, none of us have really been in sync. So, let's just put that aside.","And then to what we were trying to get across through our press release along with our opening comments was what you said about our two customers in China, their phones are delayed. Eric outlined earlier why they're being delayed. It's not because of us, it's not because of RF. It is being delayed. And what I said was they would begin in the month of June in production and really hitting high volume in the June \u2013 sorry, in March they would begin production, in the June quarter we would see significant volume. And that's the two phones that are primarily driving us in China.","And as we talked about with our largest customer in Korea, we had very large dollar content. I think it's pretty well known in the North American SKU and, quite honestly, they haven't seen the sell-through in one of their phones that they expected. And we're seeing coming down off of that, coupled with the delay in their next marquee phone. So, when you put all that together, that is the bulk of the delta that you're looking for.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then on gross margins, the prior thinking was that it would perhaps take a product redesign to improve margins for some of the sockets you had at your largest customer, which would have been perhaps harder to do for this year's product. But I think, Mark, from what you're describing, it sounds like just supply chain efficiencies, manufacturing changes and perhaps some better mix of BAW can get you to your target model for gross margins. Did I not understand the prior issue? I'm just trying to understand, what has now changed to get you back to model this year in gross margins versus actually waiting for a product redesign effort?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, let me make sure I answer it this way. You're correct about making major changes to the filters themselves within the module. What we have been doing is working hard to improve the yields on the current filters that we have in there.","So, I want to make sure when you say getting to our gross margin target, what Mark talked about is in March, which is very consistent with what we said before. So, in our mind, no change. So, if we said something that implied that, I apologize for that. But we're making the progress that we set out. That's why we hit our gross margin goal that we set and guided to in December.","That's why we believe we're going to be up in March, as Mark outlined, with mix being down of the low-band PAD this particular quarter and, as he outlined, we're still on track for 50% in the March quarter. So, Mark, if you want to add some color to that, feel free.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","That covers it. We're continuing to make a number of improvements to the manufacturing process for low-band PAD filters and modules. It's going to remain, as it's in our product portfolio, one of the lower-margin products but a good product and a high technology product.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on IDP, 29% growth on a year-over-year basis is, obviously, very impressive. If you can kind of elaborate on some of the growth drivers there, and how sustainable that growth rate is going forward that would be great. And kind of related to IDP, when you talk about your gross margin bridge for the overall company, IDP doesn't really come in, at least you guys don't talk about it explicitly. But if IDP continues to outgrow Mobile, should that provide a tailwind for gross margins as well?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","You want to take the gross margin question first and then I'll go?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, part of my \u2013 Toshiya, a number of the operational improvements that I mentioned affect both businesses. So, part of that is in \u2013 benefits IDP, but you are correct that to the extent that IDP is able to outgrow Mobile, we would see a favorable mix effect on gross margin.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","So, this is James, let me talk about the growth. It was really broad based. We've positioned the business in six rapidly growing markets, that includes smart home, automotive, optical, defense GaN, base station GaN and WiFi, and we're really winning significant slots in all of those growth segments.","In this quarter, WiFi led the way. We talked a little bit about some of the design wins in WiFi. But defense, base station and automotive also had great quarters. I'm excited, going forward \u2013 you talked a little bit about going forward both in automotive and IoT. In automotive, we see up to $10 of content going forward. In IoT, our acquisition of GreenPeak has really been a game changer for us. It gave us access into the really high growth IoT market, and the new products that were released this year in CES, we really think, are going to create significant growth going forward.","GaN-based products also continue to do very well across all the markets that we address, defense, broadband and base stations. We'll increase our GaN revenue over 20% this year. And to be honest, next year I expect it to be significantly better than that. On a go-forward basis, I think you can model IDP growth to be in line with what we say in the company, 10% to 15%, and we'll just keep pushing forward.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, I had a question on OpEx. Clearly, you've done a great job managing OpEx at kind of current levels. Can you remind us some of the initiatives, what kind of initiatives you have in place today, and when you talk about sustainability in OpEx going forward, are you thinking in absolute terms or as a percentage of sales? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah, Toshiya, a number of initiatives. We're certainly spending a lot of time on development costs for new products. And are we working most efficiently with our customers? Is our design cycle as efficient as it could be? And a number of other efforts to make sure our R&D costs are as low as possible. That is the largest part of the cost stack in OpEx.","In sales and marketing and G&A, being very disciplined about labor costs and being efficient as we grow will certainly benefit given the growth rates of the company that will naturally decrease OpEx as a percent of sales. And we're working to keep it flattish on a dollar basis is the goal and just get that natural operating leverage going forward. So, my guidance for fiscal year 2018 is to be at or below model, which is 20% of sales and OpEx, and that would require that we, on a dollar basis, are keeping those costs contained.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in, and good job on the gross margin execution. Maybe just more of a near-term question on IDP, obviously, we'd assume most of the drop-off is in Mobile. In the March quarter, what kind of sequential or year-on-year growth should we be expecting for the IDP business?","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","We're expecting to be flat, or as we say, flattish.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","And again, that will represent again a fourth quarter in a row for us to be substantially up year-over-year. And so it's going to really wind up for us a great year where we'll grow up in those mid-20s, and I think our strategy is working. I couldn't be happier with the technologies we've got, the products we have, the team we have. And so, in general, I think we're going to wrap up a great year and be prepared for that kind of good growth again next year.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And it sounds like you're still confident in the overall 10% to 15% year-on-year growth. So, then I guess in terms of the overall picture with \u2013 to get to your double-digit growth for fiscal 2018, what's embedded in terms of your expectations for smartphone growth to be able to achieve the \u2013 I guess, in this case would be close to double-digit growth in the Mobile Products business?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","We're basically modeling smartphone growth itself to be up very little, kind of low to mid single digits and the overall handset units themselves actually flat to maybe even down a bit as feature phones really taper off. So, we're not embedding any drastic assumptions about units.","As you probably know, our TAM is really driven by the content story and growing a number of bands and a number of CA combinations. WiFi is also, we believe, growing even faster than the smartphone RF TAM currently, and we think we have got a great opportunity there. And also, I think really just the mid-tier, especially in the China-based handset market, those guys are really generating some pretty big volumes now and still growing rapidly and they're really adding a lot of RF content, especially as they look to export models. So, the whole story of the dollars per handset on average growing, that's really what's driving the TAM into the double digits year-over-year.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back over to Qorvo management for any closing or final remarks.","Robert A.

Please go ahead.","Douglas DeLieto - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks very much, Keith. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com, under Investors.","In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question and a follow-up. Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings call. Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand coming strong than expected well within lead times and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers called on us and the Qorvo delivered.","Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs. Also, lesser than impact, but in the mix, early yields on high volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high volume products. Operating margin was 24% and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies. The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers, and associated material costs for prototypes.","During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for two major initiatives underway: One, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independence. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year, as new customer programs ramp.","Qorvo today is number one or number two in the majority of our growth markets, and we are investing to extend our leadership. We're building a technology moat to maintain leadership, where we're number one. And where we're number two, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader. How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs, RF Flex modules with quadplexers, RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers, Wi-Fi FEMs with BAW filters and multi-chip modules to support massive MIMO.","An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters and BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo, and BAW filters are a primary driver of our long-term operating model. To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the up fit of our Richardson fab from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in a recently acquired fab in Farmers Branch, Texas. Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal, but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year.","Demand for our first quadplexers has been robust and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next-generation BAW process and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive. For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion, and in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers.","Second, we will achieve filter independence. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products and we are adding high performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time to market and deliver higher value solutions. Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules next year will integrate high performance and lower cost internally-sourced Qorvo filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry.","To ensure we achieve filter independence, we are increasing from 6-inch to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4-inch to 6-inch SAW in temp-comp SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we're converting our 6-inch gas capacity to temp-comp SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW, which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal process for SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence. We're also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our Oregon fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second packaged assembly and test facility, even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today. We expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and 2018.","Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment, Mobile Products revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance tier smartphones and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from three-mode to full-mode smartphones for domestic and export markets.","We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers, and for our second-generation RF Flex modules, which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially, as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion, for mobile Wi-Fi. Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device experience.","We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and 5G among others will favor our unique competitive strengths and we expect this to support strong longer-term dynamics and improving visibility into our growth drivers. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions.","In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We are very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance, the addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year.","IDP continues to reposition their product portfolio to support high growth markets, and today, they are highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion. In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN PAs during the quarter and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers.","On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. Two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment. In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5-gigahertz, and we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra low-power short-range RF communication and they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of Things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%.","In transport, we began the production ramp of a quad linear 400G optical driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build-out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data. In defense, our business is up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic, active electronically scanned array radar programs, and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products.","So, from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities, and system level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration.","In summary, Qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the June quarter progressed, and the entire Qorvo team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had three 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung.","Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low-band PAD business, exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs. Upon transition to more integrated modules with Qorvo-produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand. Operating expenses increased to $169 million, on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense, and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales, and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter. Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08.","Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and short term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million, primarily to address growing premium filter demand. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November.","We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters.","As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway including conversion to 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW on our Florida fab. Conversion of our North Carolina fab, to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas, an additional Mobile Products assembling and test capacity in China. We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions, and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above market growth and drive margin expansion.","Now, let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter. Quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million, gross margin of approximately 47%, diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45, a tax rate of approximately 10%. Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand, we expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on low-band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules.","With that, we'll open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. First of all, let me ask for clarification on the September guide. Should we think that most of your growth is coming again from Mobile, like almost all of it in the September guide?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Harsh, that's correct. Most of the growth we are seeing is in Mobile. There will be some growth in IDP, but I think, most of the growth is coming from Mobile.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. So, you are expecting IDP to grow as well a little bit?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, I wanted to ask about gross margins, we've already started to get questions on that quite a bit. So, I think the \"as people say in this business,\" the high watermark was somewhere around 50%, 51%, Bob. We're at 47% now and you've got a bunch of initiatives going and I think, you mentioned in your script that it will start the reverse and go up next year. Will you be going up from a base of 46%, 47%, where you are at or are you thinking you can possibly start to climb up from the 50%s and then move up from there?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Harsh, thanks for the question. I just want to clarify, we've got a lot of initiatives and we are working on them. We have a one product if you will problem today. That we've got to reverse and we'll continue to work hard to drive that and it all comes down to how much of that product we sell can influence the gross margin percentage as you can well imagine. So, it's got a lot of content that is not internally in our fabs, we don't see the benefits of it from a contribution margin, so that does play into it. When we have our Analyst Day, we'll outline and quantify a lot of those activities to help you model next year where we can get to on the gross margin.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. So, Bob, maybe just to follow up on that gross margin. I just want to clarify, the lower gross margins that you are seeing is just because you are outsourcing a certain component, so this is really a near-term company specific issue that can be corrected. This is not the sign of some industry-wide pricing dynamic, right. I just want to get that clarified explicitly.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Sure, Vivek. So, let me start with, IDP is doing very well. Their margins held in there, no problem there. The majority of Eric's business did very well. You're right, we have one product. I will be candid with you, it's also not yielding fantastic, but for the most part, you're correct, it is a product related, not an industry structure issue. I would agree with your assessment, Vivek.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, very good. And then, as my follow up, when I look at the September quarter outlook, I sort of fell out of my chair when I saw the upside versus some of the Street expectations. But I'm curious, is there a pull forward of demand just because we are reminded of last year when the industry went through a lot of turbulence. So, you're nearly $120 million above Street expectations. First, how much is GreenPeak out of that, and then do you think there is any pull forward of demand? And the last part of that is how to think about December quarter season now given that you're having such a strong September quarter?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Number one, GreenPeak's in that $6 million, $7 million a quarter, so that's not driving all the growth. Like we said, most of the growth is coming out of Eric's business. I don't think we're seeing the pull forward. We've talked a lot about that. We still have a lot of demand that we're running hard to keep up with given the guide we even gave. As far as December goes, let me put it another way, Vivek, I think the growth that we're seeing this quarter as well as into December will be how well marquee phones sell. I think our own view is China, we're tempering our outlook for the second half of the calendar year. So, as we look into December, depends on to your question, how much of the demand is pulled in that we might be able to capture because we're all out right now. We ran very hard in the June quarter. We're running pretty hard still staying through this quarter. So as we look at things today, we're not seeing a pull forward and as we look at our customer forecast and our own expectations for in particular China market, we could see December up.","Operator","Thank you. We're going next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Kulin Patel for Ambrish. My first question is on the increasing R&D spending particularly for filter designers, what drove the increase in OpEx for R&D given that you already have what seems like a mature BAW and SAW product?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Eric, do you want to take what drives filter designer and...","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah, we have talked many times about that portfolio shifting towards more filter based products and we do continue to see that trend and in fact if anything, accelerating through all tiers of the market now, customers asking us to integrate at a higher level and include more filters and Bob mentioned our drive towards filter independence and making sure that we have the ability to design and manufacture at least the lion's share, if not all of those filters internally, so that includes regular SAW as well as TC-SAW and BAW. And so, we will continue to need more R&D bandwidth to develop the processes, but then also to develop the products and integrate them into our portfolio.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. Thanks. And for my follow-up, how much growth do you see for China for your Mobile business in the quarter?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","In the June quarter, it was pretty strong and in the September quarter, we see it continuing. As of now, the market is quite healthy and we are returning back to our kind of normal share that we should have been at earlier in the year already. So, we're kind of seeing that compound effect probably and then added to the fact that the dollar content overall continues to grow as we see more and more five-mode and six-mode 4G phones being shipped into the market.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks guys for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. Maybe Mark, if you could, give a little bit of stratification on some of those initiatives, the gross margin drivers that you guys have layered initiatives in in the past and been able to make pretty significant and sometimes rapid progress especially when it came to yield. So I guess can you just maybe talk about the timing of some of those major buckets of initiatives?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think Cody, look, right now, we'll give more specifics at the November Investor Day, but we see a path to above 50% gross margin with both the trends in the business, specifically a move to more BAW mix in the future and then also all the initiatives underway which you heard about. We're in the early innings in the number of those initiatives. So within the next several quarters, those will be completed and we expect, as you know wafer conversions 4-inch to 6-inch and 6-inch to 8-inch provides a significant benefit on throughput and then we'll be over some of the yield issues that we're having.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And maybe the follow-up then on yields. Bob said that those just weren't trending where you had expected. I guess, what's the opportunity to improve those in the current spends and how quickly can those yields improve?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Hey, Cody, this is Eric. It's a little tough to answer that. They can improve tremendously. The rate depends upon exactly how we get from here to there. Part of the nature of these products is that they ramp into very high volumes very rapidly, and so sometimes by the time you realize there is a yield issue, you already have an awful lot of product in the pipeline. That's why we are here. So we can improve them over the course of several quarters is probably the best way to answer that.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong top line and bottom line. You've obviously got a growth coming from a bunch of products with Wi-Fi and as well as the multiplexers. But I'm just curious if you could break out for us or give us a sense how big those businesses are now, where do you believe they can grow to, and then the effect on gross margins and operating margins for both of those products. Obviously multiplexers you talked about having some yield issues, but just kind of overall at a steady run rate, what kind of gross margin profile do we expect?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Mike, on the multiplexers, the quadplexers in particular for China, I'd be embarrassed to actually quote the gross margins, and we expect those to be significantly above the corporate average. And Wi-Fi is in family with the corporate average. We do fairly well there in general. And then obviously ones where we build the RF Flex for the Wi-Fi, that does have a better than company average margin.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Okay. And then also \u2013 sorry if I missed this, but you talked about some more R&D spend. Just kind of thoughts of OpEx trending forward during this fiscal year.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. What you'll see Mike, you'll see OpEx in the second quarter on a dollar basis about in line with what you saw in the first quarter. But on a percent basis, will be down towards our long-term target, which is 20% of sales. And then you'll see OpEx on a dollar basis begin to drop off through the second half as some spending we know falls off and productivity programs continue.","Operator","And we'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to ask about gross margins just to make sure I understand you guys correctly. So in the quarter, what were some of the surprises that drove the miss in gross margins and what's causing the leg down in the September quarter despite the huge ramp in revenue?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You want to take that or you want me to?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Well, again, it's primarily a single product problem and it's a low-band PAD problem where we have significant outsourced filter content. And that was a large volume product in the first quarter and it actually becomes larger in the second quarter as another low-band PAD family product comes on. So that's the effect you're seeing in first quarter and second quarter.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Toshiya, we expected better costs as well as our yields didn't hit where we expected to be at this point in time.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about BAW. You talked in your prepared remarks about utilization rates in your BAW business being suboptimal today. Could you maybe provide a bit more granularity here and also comment on when you expect utilization rates to be at or above optimal levels in BAW? Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Toshiya. What I said was we were not at optimal levels today and we've added capacity and we're continuing to add capacity as we expand from 6-inch to 8-inch and adding 8-inch in the Farmers Branch and quite honestly it's going to be the timing of new marquee phones that we're launching in, in calendar year 2017.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","And I'll just add that we're going to pace that investment as we get clarity on customer demand. We feel very good about the customer demand and the quality of our product. So we're comfortable making early commitments, but the actual construction spend pace will be determined by our clarity on wins.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Just a question on the yield issue and as it relates to gross margin. You talked about gross margin staying here through the year. Do you have line of sight as to just the cost issue part of this, or any other color you can have in terms of how you maybe deem conservative or not as to kind of the recovery from this?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Again, it's a little hard to tell the rate and pace of recovery. There are certain things that could move the needle actually relatively quickly. We're planning on it being a longer haul, as I said a couple quarters, to fix the issue, again, primarily because there's a lot of volume in the line early part of the ramp. So I think we're now well in, in terms of the number of parts produced. We understand the yield issue quite well. And so I don't think there is a lot of uncertainty from this point forward other than how rapidly we can implement the changes and get it through the pipeline.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as my follow-up, in terms of capital allocation, you did GreenPeak, which is kind of tuck-in; you've been fairly aggressive buying back stock. So big picture, how you view best use of cash here in terms of your own stock versus attempts to diversify the business?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, you want to take that?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, it's a good question. I guess I'll start with buyback. We've repurchased $1.3 billion of shares in the last five quarters, and we have $250 million remaining on our $1 billion authorization. I'll add that we currently expect to continue buying our shares under that authorization. We're interested obviously in a thoughtful capital allocation framework. That will consider organic growth opportunities, including CapEx needs which we just talked about on BAW. Those are very high-return projects, relatively low risk from a project execution standpoint. So those would be early priority on spend.","We're always looking at acquisition opportunities that would fit well with Qorvo, but I'll add that we're not capacity constrained from a balance sheet standpoint to doing those, but there's a very high bar on return requirements for allocation of capital to those opportunities. And then we plan to be regular steady buyers of our shares as part of this thoughtful capital allocation framework and that's what we've done.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Eric, you said you were surprised by that gross margin on the low-band PAD coming in here and the several comments that intimated both there was a cost and a yield issue. Yield I get I suppose because you can always get surprised, but can you explain what happened on cost? It was at the SAW filters? Did they raise prices to you? Was it not BAW pricing? What changed from the time that you did the prototype and you bid the part and won the part to the time you started producing the part that smacked margins as hard as they were? And then, as a follow-up, you've got a gazillion programs going on here. You're moving to 8-inch in BAW in Richardson. Are you starting an 8-inch in Farmers Branch? Are you ramping an 8-inch? Meaning, is it already up and running moving to 8-inch?","You have 6-inch in TC in Florida. You're launching, I'm assuming, a 6-inch TC and a SAW in North Carolina, moving GaN to Texas, moving GaAs to Oregon and a new PAD facility in China. Maybe you could take a few minutes to just walk through what the impact of some or all of these are on the margin issues, maybe none, maybe some, and whether it's utilization whatever, because as I'm sure most of the other guys on this call were getting flooded with gross margin questions even before the call started. So any help would be appreciated.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, I'll take the easiest one. We're starting out in Farmers Branch on 8-inch. So we will start with what we believe will be our lowest cost there, and again, we'll qualify the line in 2017 and be ready for production in 2018. As far as what's going on in the packaging assembly and test facility, again that's one of the largest premerger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is outside assembly houses, and in fact given the volume we're running right now, we have a lot of work on the outside and that's why they're bringing up. And we had our grand opening in Dezhou just a few weeks ago, and as we in-source that, that is a significant cost savings for us.","As far as, yes, in Greensboro, we're starting in 6-inch with standard SAW and temp-comp SAW and it's a significant margin improvement over what we're paying outside, I'll say it that way. But it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current product. So, again, much more of a 2017 story than a 2016 story. And as far as, you know the diameters and you can do the math on what the savings is from 6-inch to 8-inch and we'll give you a lot more color on the timing of that at the Analyst Day. But, again, most of these things really take hold in 2017. I know you had a question for Eric as well.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yes. We probably can't say much about the outsourced content to your question other than to say that it's a source that's clearly not a long-term viable candidate. There's not much flexibility in the near-term in terms of pricing and what we can do with that supplier. Internally, though, the yields are related to some specifications at the end product level, but also to your point, this is the first volume to ramp very hard in the new 6-inch TC line, and we're definitely working out a lot of issues in there as well that's contributing certainly to the issue.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Guys, I was wondering if you could comment on what you think your total dollar content gains were for premium phones say this year versus last year \u2013 and I know there are tons of SKUs and stuff, but a rough assessment for the flagship phones?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I do feel confident in is we grew our dollar content. Clearly at one of our customers you guys know we grew significantly more dollar content as they released phones throughout the year. If I look at our top three customers, we've expanded our dollar contents. And to your point, it really gets down to mix on SKUs, but I think in aggregate, we've definitely increased our share as well as our dollar content.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. And I just wanted to follow-up on Vivek's question a little bit around seasonality. So you talked about growing in December. Does that growth suggest anything about how it might look into March? Typically you have a pretty steep dip. And so I'm just wondering if this is being pull forward somewhat, does that suggest a more shallow March or would that trend more normally?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, to be clear, I don't believe I acknowledged there's any pull forward. I said if there was, then it could impact December. But right now we don't view it as demand being pulled forward. I think if you look at what happened last year, and I think it's pretty widely known that some of the marquee phones didn't quite sell as well into the December quarter, which impacted December and slightly in the March. So I think it all does come down to if you're asking what December and March are going to look like. As we said, China, we seem to be getting back to our normal share levels there, so that's where the strength in the China market that we see. We see it continues to migrate from 3-mode, to 5-mode and 4-mode. So that's dollar content. We think that China market is doing well, but we have a conservative view in my comments for December. And to your point, typically, March is down seasonally, and I don't think that's going to change from any other year.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Caso with CLA (sic) [CLSA] (38:48).","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just a follow-up question with regard to China and the comments, and I think you've talked about tempering your expectations, yet the revenue growth is strong. So if maybe you could clarify more specifically what your expectations would be for China as you go into the September quarter, how much of that is dialed into your growth expectations, and then perhaps into the December quarter as well?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","So we do have growth in China dialed in that's based on actually very strong backlog at this time in order activity and visibility into the dollar content expansions that our customers are asking for these phones. However, the majority of the growth is not driven by China this quarter. It's driven by other large customers in marquee phone ramps.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, we've heard I guess different commentary from different folks with regard to inventory levels at customers now as you're going into the seasonally stronger period of the year. I guess two questions on that. One is, although you took a hit from some inventory reductions back starting in last December quarter, do you think those still persisted in the June quarter, such that you're shipping below customer consumption? And at this point as we go into the September quarter, do you think those inventory reductions are now complete?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd rather just make this comment at a very high level. Typically, we ship into our customers well before they start selling because they build up their inventory to go. So typically in June, we would typically be under shipping what they're selling. So, what I can say is specifically about our business, we saw what was coming, we took actions in December, a little bit in March, but we were pretty much clean starting in June.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And Chris, I'll add that, our turns did increase about 10% and then our inventory levels did go up about $30 million, but that was, as you can see now, to prepare for the September and follow-on quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co.","Wayne Loeb - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hello. This is Wayne Loeb for Tim. It appears that some major smartphone markers are now second sourcing their modems. Can you comment on your relative RF share, when attached to an Intel versus Qualcomm high ended modem?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry, we are not going to be able to comment.","Wayne Loeb - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. I will try one more thing then. On envelope trackers, are you seeing some traction there. It seems like some other non-Qualcomm modems do not yet have an envelope tracker, are you seeing some traction or any attachment to that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think Eric would love to talk about ET PMICs.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. We've been in production for several generations now. We do continue to see increased traction, really across all tiers in the market and with several baseband manufacturers.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on gross margins, as well your peer Skyworks guided flat margins on revenue growth in September, you guys are guiding down gross margins. I understand there's no structural change in the pricing environment. But can you comment on maybe parts of the market like low-band PADs, which are more commoditized. And if you can also help me understand why you would be chasing low-band PADs if you have been stronger in the mid-band and high-band historically?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, Eric.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah, sure. I want to say quite clearly that this is not a pricing issue. I also actually take issue in saying low-band PAD is a commoditized business. I don't think that's the case at all, especially these high performance low-band PADs with temperature-compensated SAW filters in them. These are very high performance products, very few people can manufacture them. It's not commoditized and there's not a pricing issue going on here at all.","Because they're incredibly hard to manufacture, we're having some yield, ramping a new one and associated with again our new wafer line in it. So, why we're in the low-band PAD business? It's actually a premium product category and we see a lot of customers now asking us and giving us the opportunity to do the entire RF frontend. You need to have low-band, mid-band and high-band, all the switching and power management so forth to be able to do that. So it's an important part of the portfolio, it's going to be a very powerful part of the portfolio as well going forward.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And as a follow up, Mark, can you talk about the full fiscal 2017 CapEx expectations for the year?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We're going to be about, if I recall, about 15% of sales for the year, if we maintain our pace of spend. Just to be clear, I mentioned that if we don't have the clarity, we'll certainly slow down the spend. So, I'd say I don't expect it to be any worse than about 15%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on that BAW capacity question. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that you're not at optimal levels. I'm just wondering, are you referring to the fact you're underutilized currently or you guys are running full out and you need to add capacity in the near-term to meet demand? And then I've got a follow-up question.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Quinn, we are not running at capacity or nowhere close to that. So I would tell you, we're under loaded than from optimum.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay, great. And then, just coming back to the gross margin, obviously, you talked a lot about the low-band PAD. I was wondering if you could make any comments about sort of the China product gross margin especially as you ramp the quadplexers, hexaplexers, is the mobile product going into China carrying sort of corporate or at least mobile product average gross margins? Is there anything you can distinguish in terms of gross margin contribution from China versus some of the premium customers?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So there's really not a large difference. There's a wide \u2013 not a wide range \u2013 but there's a range of gross margins for the different product types that sell into China. In general, the portfolio, especially the newer products are basically in line with the average mobile portfolio margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just wondering here on the revenue guidance has a range of $30 million versus in the past you gave us specific targets. What's some of the sensitivity there? What percent booked are you to get to the midpoint?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have a great new CFO, who thought that maybe we ought to be able to provide you guys with more of a range, because of his experience and looking at our past performance that it's probably more prudent to do that. And I think you also noticed one of our competitors also gave a range, who typically gave a point. So, we just thought it would be good to give you the clarity there in the range. And as far as booked for the quarter between our backlog, customer forecast, things like that, we're in good shape.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Good shape. Okay. Great. And then just a clarification on gross margins, low-band PADs impacted by the sourcing of filters. Sounds like you've got multiple products, multiple models. I mean, can seasonality in the coming quarters ever cause a more favorable mix shift later this fiscal year or are we really waiting for the fiscal 2018 manufacturing efficiencies and filters that come online?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This part, as you said seasonality or sell-through of the end customers' products can definitely impact our percentage of gross margin, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for another gross margin one. Just wanted to clarify. So the gross margin was weaker in June, and then in September it's down a little bit more. It sounds like two issues, you have an issue on multiplexers, and then you had this low-band PAD. I was just trying to understand what the impact was in both quarters? Did you quantify it? And then just understand what's the bigger driver between those two?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Blayne, the quadplexers had a larger impact in the June quarter than the low-band PAD and the low-band PAD has a bigger impact, much bigger impact this quarter, and the quadplexers we've taken some actions and made some progress.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. And then just a follow-up in terms of the yield issues, has that impacted any delivery dates or what's your lead times? And then, in terms of fixing these issues, do these require redesigns of any of these parts which then need to be re-qualified on phones or is it something you can you do on the fly in a given model?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Pretty detailed question. Yeah, so I would say, yield issues of course, we're working through those and assuring a continuation of the supply. Organization is working really, really hard to do that. In terms of redesign, not expected at all, potentially test program changes and so forth that, of course, we coordinate with our customers. But these are things that can happen relatively quickly.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. And holding up any phone shipments?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Right. No.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","None.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Good guide here. Just going back on the gross margin question again. As you guys (48:59) for the fiscal 2017 I guess, but as you look at pulling the filters in- house, I know one of your peers is sitting on a lot filter inventory and then obviously the Japanese OEMs all have a lot of filter exposure, filter supply there. Does that create more filter pricing pressure? What's your thoughts there?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure I fully understood the question on...","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I'm just wondering, as you pull your filters in-house, and there is obviously more excess filters in the supply chain, does that increase pricing pressure on the filter side?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. I'm sorry, I guess, we're having a hard time following why pulling the filter products inside would create excess inventory of filters and create pricing pressure. It would go the opposite way I think in...","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...in discrete.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. Discrete filters are becoming a very small part of the market. The trend is that the filters are being integrated into higher level functionality such as our fusion modules and so forth.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then when they're integrated, just to be clear, they're wafer level packaged opposed to packaged in a ceramic package, which is the way a discrete filter's sold.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And you talked about 6-inch and 8-inch transition here, what do you expect your mix of 6-inch and 8-inch by the end of calendar 2016, if you can give us some idea there? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As far as 8-inch BAW filters go, it's going to be a very low percentage, that's what we're converting to this year and again, as I've said, bringing up in Farmers Branch. And in SAW filters, as we continue to expand in Florida as well as bringing up the North Carolina facility, that mix will start to move to 6-inch a much larger percentage. Don't have the percentage off the top of my head again, we'll give you that at Analyst Day, but it will be a larger percentage 6-inch.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow up from Harsh Kumar. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I promise no gross margin question here. I was curious, Mark, if you ever gave China as a percentage of sales for either June or what your expectation is for September?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think we did provide that.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hold on a second, Harsh. Give us a minute we'll go through it. Hold on.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Then let me ask something else while you guys are looking at it. Mark and then, I think you mentioned that OpEx will fall as the back half approaches, can I ask you to clarify if it will fall as a percentage of sales or will it fall in absolute dollars from here?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, what I said Harsh was that it'll be about flat on a dollar basis in the second quarter, the September quarter and will drop as a percent of sales basis to about 20%. In the subsequent quarters, we expect it to drop on a dollar basis.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","So, next year it could drop on a dollar basis. Got it. Thanks. And then whenever you guys...","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer","Just to be clear, drop in the second half of this fiscal year on a dollar basis.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Harsh, excluding Huawei who is a corporate 2% customer, as you know the China business is about a third of the mobile business in the June quarter and a bit less than the third in the September quarter.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll also take a follow-up from Ed Snyder. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks. You mentioned GaAs moving to Oregon, Bob are you consolidating all GaAs fab in Oregon or will you still be split between Oregon and North Carolina? And then TriQuint started TC-SAW, it was the first one to actually produce that filters years ago and I know that one of your competitors kind of leapfrogged you in modules to your largest customer and so they are large in TC-SAW. But I'm a little surprised you guys are having yield problems with TC-SAW. Is it a new process, a new part, given your legacy and how long you've been in this technology? What's changed there that made this more difficult part, just the filtered stuff, forget the module? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Ed, we are transitioning over time our Greensboro gallium arsenide as well as GaN and they will be focused on filters. And as far as the temp-comp SAW...","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. I think you hit on it earlier, we're doing a lot right now including adding factories in Florida and Greensboro and also going from 4-inch to 6-inch and managing issues of wafer breakage as well as parameter distributions, and as you really run more and more and more wafers to the new 6-inch line, you begin to see the full distribution. Also, I think the requirements at the end module are tougher, generation, regeneration, the requirements are getting harder. So dialing in these specifications at a very fine level is the issue.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","And I know you mentioned it, Bob, but to buy parts from the outside market like you're doing now because everybody outsources SAW at this point, even your competitors, you're buying a packaged part from them, which is large and more expensive, et cetera. When you go internally, it will be a wafer scale packaging, shouldn't we expect, and I don't know what the mix is, but I'm expecting you're using quite a bit of that product in some of your modules, low-band PAD, maybe diversity module. Shouldn't we expect to see a significant improvement in gross margin given the fact that one, you're producing and two, it's going to be smaller, more efficient part than what you could buy on the outside market already? And just if you could, maybe give us some idea of the timing of when you think you'll be independent in SAW?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So maybe big picture Ed, certainly you're on the right track. We absolutely expect that when we can in-source these filter ourselves in our new larger factories that are well utilized, we will definitely see improvements in gross margin. And this is a multi-generational thing, this cannot happen overnight to completely eliminate outsourcing of the filters. We're starting on it, we're adding new capacity, adding the filter designers to be able to do it, it will take two or three product cycles to get there.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I will turn it to management for closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As always, we thank you for joining us tonight.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President, Investor Relations for Qorvo. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks very much, Dana. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.","During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results.

Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Hello and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter call. March quarterly revenue was approximately $642 million. Gross margin expanded 190 basis points sequentially to 46.2%. And we achieved EPS above the midpoint of our provided range.","For the year, we delivered revenue of approximately $3 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth, driven by 23% growth in IDP and 14% growth in Mobile Products. We're very proud of what the Qorvo team delivered in fiscal 2017 and we're excited about our opportunities for continued growth in fiscal 2018.","Qorvo offers the industry's broadest portfolio of products, technologies and integration capabilities. And we are rapidly introducing new products that enable increasingly advanced and complex architectures. We are building a business that best addresses where our markets are headed. In fiscal 2018, we expect continued strong revenue growth and margin expansion.","In both Mobile Products and IDP, we are expanding our product portfolios to deliver superior performance and increasing functionality. This is translated into large design wins and has given us greater confidence in our growth drivers. Specifically, we expect to expand our dollar content at our largest customer later this year. And we are forecasting expanding dollar content at our second and third largest customers, as next-generation flagship and mass market platforms are launched.","Operationally, we continue to make progress on our conversion to eight-inch BAW and six-inch temp-comp SAW. And we are on track to significantly reduce our BAW and SAW filter die sizes. We've completed multiple operational initiatives to reduce cost and enhance productivity. And we expect to see the benefits of these accomplishments in fiscal 2018, supporting an improvement in our return on invested capital.","Looking to Mobile, Qorvo is a leader across multiple categories with exciting growth opportunities from the transceiver to the antennae. We are improving the RF performance of our customers' devices with highly integrated solutions, complemented by our expanding portfolio of highly differentiated discrete components. We recently launched our BAW 5 based products and customer poll has been strong. Our first BAW 5 shipments commenced in the March quarter with our industry-leading RF Fusion for Wi-Fi iFEMs, supporting Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.","We are broadly integrating BAW 5 filters across the portfolio. In Mobile Wi-Fi, we are combining our BAW 5 filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. And we expect recent design wins will translate into strong growth. We believe the performance advantage of Qorvo's iFEMs will ultimately prove disruptive for the costly SiP architectures in use today in many marquee smartphones.","The breakthrough performance of Qorvo's BAW 5 resonators and our proven design capabilities have received customer validation. That's led to close collaboration with a key customer to support a major custom product development project. We are combining multiple high order multiplexers with PAs, switches and low noise amplifiers to participate in the industry's most complex and most difficult to address product category.","We're extremely pleased to have earned this opportunity. It requires a multi-year commitment. And we're competing to win. It's opportunities like this that we expect will drive BAW-based revenue to represent approximately 40% of Mobile's revenue in fiscal 2019.","Now turning to premium tier smartphones, we're enjoying strong demand for RF Fusion for cellular. In the March quarter, we added ZTE to the list of customers buying our full suite of RF Fusion solutions, combining low-band, mid-band and high-band placements. These highly compact solutions cover multiple modes and bands and require more temp-comp SAW and more BAW.","For the performance tier, design activity for RF Flex has been robust across Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and others. During the March quarter, we achieved full certification of the first single placement, integrated module, covering low, mid and high bands on a MediaTek reference design. To be clear, this module integrates all major RF functions required in the main path, including amplifiers, switches and filters for low, mid and high frequencies in a single Qorvo placement.","Among our highly differentiated discrete solutions, Qorvo's ET capabilities are also driving growth. Our envelope trackers significantly enhance power efficiency and improve battery life. This is a unique competitive edge and we expect solid year-over-year growth, with growth accelerating in the second half. We're also forecasting strong year-over-year growth for Qorvo switches and tuners.","During the March quarter, we secured multiple design wins at Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and others, in support of our performance tier smartphones. We also released our third-generation configurable impedance tuner for multimode, primary and secondary antenna applications, including 4x4 MIMO. Similar to envelope tracking, we expect our switch and tuner revenue will expand this year with significant growth in the second half.","Turning to Infrastructure and Defense, Qorvo continued to connect and protect with robust year-over-year revenue growth reflecting the successful repositioning of our product portfolio to target high growth segments. This is the seventh consecutive strong quarter for IDP, with key wins across all end markets and customer design wins pointing to another year of above market growth.","IDP is a vertically integrated, diversified business with a strategic focus on six secular growth markets: defense, base station, Wi-Fi, optical transport, automotive and IoT. The markets we are addressing represent a combined $4 billion opportunity that's forecast to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate in the mid-teens. In the defense and aerospace markets, we achieved over 20% year-over-year growth, driven by GaN-based products.","In addition, we're supporting a large portfolio of multi-year defense production programs. In base station, we continue to drive the migration from 4G to 5G. We launched highly integrated receive modules for pre-5G massive MIMO networks. When combined with Qorvo's GaN based integrated drivers and power amplifier modules, these dual channel switch LNA modules provide a complete, highly integrated solution for our wireless infrastructure customers seeking to quickly and cost-effectively implement pre-5G massive MIMO networks.","We're also actively engaged with all major OEMs on next-generation 4G and pre-5G macro base station GaN power amplifiers. We continue to expand our portfolio of receive and transmit solutions for additional frequency bands for pre-5G and 5G wireless infrastructure. In Wi-Fi, IDP grew greater than 40% year-over-year with notable strength in 5GHz PAs and 802.11ac FEMs. Our product development emphasis is now on 802.11ax products. We have sampled key customers and believe we are positioned for strong growth and expanding market presence in fiscal 2018.","During the quarter, we secured an important 802.11ac win in the recently released Sonos sound bar for home audio networks. This is strategically significant since this win includes a BAW filter. And the integration of BAW filters into our Wi-Fi solutions is a focus for IDP. We also secured a win in a recently launched dual-band 802.11ac wireless router, delivering up to 1.2 gigabits per second. We're quickly filling this Wi-Fi sales funnel, including for 802.11ax programs. And we anticipate strong growth, well above the underlying Wi-Fi market in fiscal 2018.","In automotive connectivity, we launched auto-qualified filtering and amplifier products to address the growing industry requirements for robust connectivity solutions. During the quarter, our Beijing facility achieved TS16949 certification, recognizing that our quality management systems meet stringent automotive standards. This is our fifth facility to earn automotive certification, further validating our long-term commitment to the automotive market.","In other IoT applications, Qorvo continues to support the proliferation of open standard solutions with the launch of our SoC that supports multiple protocols, including ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy and Thread. Our SoC solution is ideally suited for remote control applications and opens the door for opportunities in additional connected home markets.","Qorvo's opportunities in optical markets continue to expand. During the March quarter, we released five PAM4 solutions for data center interconnect applications. In the optical space, leading customers want greater speed and capacity with lower power consumption and cost, positioning our products for growth in fiscal 2018.","Across both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo's focus on product and technology leadership is supporting large design wins, giving us greater confidence in our growth drivers. In IDP, our focus on higher growth segments continues to fuel an expanding sales funnel.","In Mobile, we expect to increase our dollar content at our largest customer later this year. And we are forecasting expanding dollar content at our second and third largest customers with the launch of next-generation flagship and mass market smartphone platforms. We look forward to discussing these and other opportunities at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 25.","And, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for commentary on our financials.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Qorvo delivered continued year-over-year growth, higher sequential gross margin and EPS in the upper end of our guidance range. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP revenue was $642 million, a year-over-year increase of 6% or approximately $35 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $474 million. IDP revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $168 million on continued growth in defense, Wi-Fi and IoT.","Qorvo revenue for the full fiscal year 2017 exceeded $3 billion, up 16% versus fiscal 2016. This exceptional growth reflects our strong technology position, broad market product portfolio, and growing supply capabilities. We expect our technology and product pipeline to continue to drive strong revenue growth in fiscal year 2018.","Gross margin in the quarter was 46.2%, a sequential increase of 190 basis points. We expect our positive gross margin trend to continue into the June quarter. Operating expenses were in line with expectations at $163 million and operating income for the quarter was approximately $133 million. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.85 or $0.05 over the midpoint of our guidance range. We ended fiscal 2017 EPS at $4.57.","Fourth quarter cash flow from operations remains strong at $247 million, over 50% higher than last year. Capital expenditures were $166 million, primarily related to timing of filter capacity additions. Free cash flow was $81 million and cash at quarter-end increased to $545 million. We returned $51 million to shareholders in the quarter under our $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to continue buying as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","Let's turn to our outlook. In the fiscal year 2018 first quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $610 million and $650 million, gross margin expansion to approximately 47%, a tax rate below 10%, and diluted EPS between $0.70 and $0.90. This guidance reflects normal seasonal effects at our largest customer and weaker than expected near-term China demand. Operating expenses are forecast to increase sequentially approximately $5 million, in part to R&D related custom product development for our largest customer.","Our view on full year fiscal 2018 remains positive. We forecast revenue to strengthen through the year. We expect strong revenue growth, along with higher BAW based product mix, higher utilization rates and ongoing productivity and quality improvements to help us achieve our 50% gross margin target exiting fiscal year 2018. We expect OpEx efficiency to continue to improve and forecast operating expenses to be approximately 20% of sales for the year.","We are resolute in hitting our operating model of 30% operating margin during the fiscal year 2018. Our non-GAAP tax rate is projected to remain below 10%. CapEx spend in 2018 is currently forecast to decline to around $400 million, as we complete our expansion to support multi-year above market growth for our filter-based products.","With strong revenue growth, expanding gross margins, improving OpEx efficiency and lower CapEx, we expect free cash flow to double from fiscal year 2017 to 2018.","In summary, for the fourth quarter, we again delivered on our financial commitments. We also made progress on positioning the company for growth and margin expansion. Our newly released BAW 5 technology has immediately gained commercial traction in cellular, Wi-Fi and other applications. This technology, along with our proven design capabilities, is providing us the opportunity to work on the industry's most complex integrated modules and enabling us to participate in the largest and most attractive markets in RF.","IDP's portfolio continues to grow more attractive with broad-based exposure to many high growth markets, including 5G, Wi-Fi, automotive, and other IoT. Though we're a bit slower out of the gate than expected due to near-term softness in China demand, our forecast outlook for the full year of fiscal 2018 looks good.","Operationally, we continue to make solid progress on yield improvements, wafer size conversions, capacity rationalizations, sourcing initiatives and other productivity efforts to drive margin expansion. We are serving our customers better and performing more consistently and efficiently in the process. We are on track to meeting our operating margin target of 30% and, as mentioned, expect to double free cash flow in fiscal year 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, Bob and Mark. I had a quick question. I think I want to take you back to last quarter. You had issues in China with two models that didn't come out. Curious if the guide for June has some of that impact. Have the models started to ramp or come out? Is the issue that you're talking about in this call in China \u2013 is that different or similar or part? And is there some optical impact? Because we're hearing from a lot of optical companies that are sort of struggling in China as well. Could you just clarify some of that for me?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Harsh, it's Mark. So, the guide we gave in June was 7% to 10% sequential growth off of the 6.30% midpoint we had for the March quarter. So that would have been 6.80%, 6.85%. As you can see from our guide now, we're $50 million, $55 million off that.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","The vast majority of that is China and it's China Mobile specifically, China Mobile our business. About $30 million of it is related to inventory, not at our distributors, but at the end manufacturers that we were unaware of from December. And we became aware of it just recently. And, as a result, it's a $30 million variance to what we thought June would be as the market works through that inventory. Additionally, we talked to you about handset delays. One of those handsets \u2013 one of the regional models actually ended up getting canceled. So that was a $10 million impact. And then the remaining $10 million was just we didn't see the recovery after Chinese New Year that we typically had seen. And that was accountable for about $10 million of the variance.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Mark, extremely helpful. I'm going to switch over to technology. Bob, you mentioned a lot about winning in BAW. You're winning at a lot of the Chinese guys. Are you winning also at what we would consider as your typical U.S.-based tier 1 guys? Also, when can we expect shipments of some of these BAW wins to come in?","And then, you mentioned BAW could potentially be going to 40% by, I think you said, fiscal 2019, which is like a year and a half out. Could you give us an idea where it's at today, if possible, so we can try to size the expansion there? And then, last question, you mentioned that you're doing a custom project with somebody to combine PSR up (23:06). Are we talking about PS&R up (23:09) from the same chip? Just any color would be helpful.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","All right. Harsh, I'll do my best to answer that. And I'm sure Eric would love to chime in. So let me start with opening comments I made. About 40% of the mobile revenue in FY 2019 or 40% of mobile revenue in FY 2019 will be BAW based. Today, it's under 30%. And we talked about this on the last call and growing in 2018 and growing to about 40%, based on the products that we're working on and the wins that we have.","And, Harsh, that's what gives us the confidence to go ahead and continue to invest the capital in BAW. As you know, we made large investments in FY 2017, as Mark outlined, to our capital expenditure in this FY 2018. We will continue to expand our BAW. And, as we mentioned on the prior calls, that we need to get all that qualified before we can really ramp it in FY 2019. So, we have to put the capital in place about a year ahead. And we talked about Farmers Branch.","So that's pretty how much all that's going. As far as BAW revenues go, yes, we talked a lot about BAW 5 going into Wi-Fi, also into the cellular. So, many of the phones made in Korea, as well as in China, so, broad-based. The product that I talked about in my opening comments was one of the most challenging and complex that the industry has really seen, is taking very complicated multiplexers that are BAW based, putting them in a module, with power amplifiers, switches and LNAs. Some of those, obviously, Harsh, are on different technologies. So, I hope that answers your question.","Operator","We'll go next to Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks a lot. A bunch of questions. Let's stick with the BAW topic since we're on it already. Last time we spoke, Bob, you were backing off the expansion of Farmers Branch. Is that back on? Are you spinning that fab up now or is it still all just Richardson? And on your 40% of revenue for mobile, how many of those designs that would drive that number are, one, in heading for production now versus what you're working on? Just trying to get an idea of the visibility of that revenue, versus, I know, there's a ton of projects out there that are pulling in BAW, but they're not \u2013 they're still in the design phase.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, Ed, let me clarify what we implied with Farmers Branch is we put in a single thread of line that we were bringing up in the factory and qualify. That's what's in place and that's what we're working on right now and it's going extremely well. We're seeing distributions in the processing parameters and they're very similar to what we're seeing in Richardson. So that's going well.","The capital that we're talking about spending this year will be going into Farmers Branch. So, we're not backing away from that. What we said is the timing of when we're in production will most likely be in FY 2019. That really hasn't changed. And the capital that we spent mostly in winding up right now is finishing the buildout of Richardson. So hopefully that's helpful.","And then, Ed, I believe the second question was what percent or coverage do we have of that 40%. Don't have that at my fingertips, Ed. What we did talk about was the BAW based products, some of our high-band products that are going into various customers in China and Korea that's driving a lot of that growth this year and then the following year will be that continuation, along with others, that I talked about.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Great. And then, Eric, if I could, you led off the conference call talking about Wi-Fi modules, which is a brand new area for you and one of your competitors. Most of the time you've been supplying components to other aggregators like Murata. And I know you guys have been working on this for a while. It sounds like you're continuing on that progress. Could you give us an update? Are you just looking at designs that you're working on?","It sounds like you've got a couple of your customers who are getting kind of excited about pulling your quality. When do you think you're going to see production revenue on that product, if at all? And then, Mark, if you could, I think you said you're going to grow revenue in fiscal year 2018. Last quarterly call you were talking about double-digit revenue for the year in 2018 over 2017. Is that still your target, double-digit revenue or have you kind of backed off that? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Do you want to take the Wi-Fi first? Mark, the follow-up.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. We're very excited about the Wi-Fi portfolio and have been now for a few quarters for sure as we've seen it outgrowing a lot of our other products. The actual concept of taking our leadership in BAW coexist filters and combining it then with power amplifiers, which is in LNAs, that's sort of one of our first Qorvo products. It came about from the merger. And so we started that development about two years ago. And we're already shipping those, previously. Over the past several quarters, we've been ramping that business.","Now the opportunity, though, is to take our BAW 5 technology, which is really groundbreaking for that and put that in the modules. And that's what is now beginning to ramp into production. And you're right. We are seeing just a lot of adoption for that. It really, in some ways, simplifies, lowers the cost and increases the performance in Wi-Fi when you do away with the SiP and go with our solution. So the Chinese manufacturers in particular \u2013 some of our leading customers there are really moving that way very rapidly.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","And before handing it off to Mark, I mean, Ed, also in James' business in IDP we're seeing the same phenomenon with people wanting to take that coexist filter and put it into the same module. So, we're also \u2013 that's beginning to drive our growth there with BAW 5. And I mentioned that in my opening comments as well as it's in the press release.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","So, Ed. It's Mark. Still see growth of double-digits in fiscal year 2018. With the slow start in China, I'd say it's closer to 10% at this point. And as you can imagine, there's a lot of \u2013 back half of the year, not great visibility on timing and mix, but we still see 10% as a number that we're preparing to build to, based on industry reports and customer demand signals. With that, you can imagine that we would have a sizable ramp June quarter to September quarter at the over 30% sequential growth. And then you'd see a peak in the December quarter and then you'd see normal seasonality in the March quarter down.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Mark, I just wanted to follow up on that commentary that you're providing for fiscal 2018. Gross margin, given the fact that you don't have great visibility on the mix as well as the ramp, why and how are you feeling comfortable that you can deliver on the trajectory that you laid out a couple quarters ago?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Ambrish, we feel great about the trajectory and the best data point is actuals. And we've beat our gross margin target in the December and March quarters. And even if you add back the issues we had in the September quarter, we were actually very close to our guide there. So, we're in control and steadily increasing our margins. We have a guide with another 80 basis point margin expansion and we see that expansion continuing through the year. As you say, there's a lot of issues with mix and customer ramp timing. And in order to get these productivity or get these margin expansion benefits, there's a lot of productivity programs in flight. But we're doing very well. We still have visibility to 50, but as you point out, there are a lot of risks.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And you should be commended on hitting the two quarters on the gross margin. I wanted to just \u2013 and I'm just struggling with this and I'm sure others on the call are as well to try to compare your results with Skyworks. And we all get it. One quarter is not a barometer, but now two quarters the divergence between your results and theirs is huge. Is it a mix issue at your specific program that you're in? Is it a pricing or content that you're losing that you had anticipated earlier on? Just trying to get a better sense and any perspective along those lines would help. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thanks, Cody (sic) [Ambrish]. And you're right \u2013 oh. Sorry, Ambrish. Sorry. You're right about that. It is hard to judge us on one or even two quarters because I think when we look out over the last four quarters, our fiscal year growth of 16% \u2013 I think that compares very favorably.","The last call when we talked about June, we did share with you guys that we've lost a little bit of share at Huawei. On this call, I did talk about gaining that back. We talked about at Samsung \u2013 quite honestly, we said we were going to grow our dollar content, but we didn't think we were going to grow our share. So if you recall, they did talk a lot about their growth at Huawei and Samsung. So that must be what's driving their growth today.","But, again, we're confident in our growth. I look at the first two fiscal years that we've grown as a company. We've grown very nicely double-digits and we just said we're going to do it again. So, we're not really trying to compare ourselves to Skyworks. We're saying we're going to grow as fast as the market and sometimes faster. So, we feel good about what we're doing.","Operator","We'll go next to Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton","Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe just on the Chinese side, can you just talk about maybe the overall percentage of revenue that China made up, for Mobile specifically? And then what is your level of visibility into the excess inventory situation? I guess what's your degree of confidence that this gets cleaned up in a relatively short-term?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Hey, Cody. This is Eric. I'll take that. Percentage of Mobile revenue total China was about 35%, including Huawei, and Huawei was just over 10% of Mobile rev. So, open market China was about 24%, certainly lower than it traditionally is.","And then the other question about the visibility into the inventory, yes. So essentially what's happened is, through a lot more closer examination of the sell-through of the channel and looking at GfK reports and so forth and working with the customers \u2013 that's where we've uncovered the extra inventory that was being held over.","As we began to go through April and saw actual recovery in the end unit of handsets, we saw that our recovery wasn't following. And that's how we were able to peel down and find the extra inventory. I think now we've had enough detailed discussion with our customers, and it's really limited to really just a couple of customers there, that we're expecting a lot stronger ending to the last calendar year. I think we've got very, very good visibility both into the inventory as well as the new models and our design content, which continues to grow and how the rest of the year is going to unfold.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton","I guess, Eric, are you doing anything differently now to make sure that you guys don't get surprised like this with excess inventory?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","There's always opportunities to improve. There's better data there always improving the visibility into that market as it gets bigger. So, we're changing systems and adding tools continuously to try to learn from each of these and tighten up the controls going forward.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton","And then, lastly, I guess, any issues of pricing that's maybe played into this, particularly in China?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","No, not at all.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. First question, just following up on China and really the trajectory of the market, understanding some of this is inventory digestion but we're also hearing just kind of the end growth has slowed a bit. And then you actually have Apple into the back half of the year, which probably soaks up some units. So, could China stay relatively muted as we go through the year because of those dynamics?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Eric. I'll take that as well. I think we continue to see a lot of exciting trends going on in our customer base in China as we're working very closely with the architectures going forward, going from Phase 2 to 3 to 5 to 6. We continue to see the opportunity to lead there and bring more and more differentiation, actually more dollar content.","We see the content itself increasing as they're looking to export to various regions and adding those bands and also adding more carrier aggregation complexity and so forth. But what's uniquely exciting, I think, for Qorvo is as we've progressed through each of these phases of architecture, we have the opportunity to bring in a lot of our leading filter technology like BAW 5, as well as our SAW and TC-SAW portfolio, adding multiplexors and seeing how we can increase our ability to help the customers get to market more quickly.","With MediaTek as an example, it kind of leads those phase architectures from 2 through 6 as I mentioned. Every generation we've seen a closer interaction and we believe we've gotten into more and more of a leadership position there. One example of that. We just announced that we've achieved full certification of the first fully integrated module for a MediaTek reference design. That includes all the RF functionality of the main path. It also has a mix of SAW and BAW filters in it covering low, mid and high. Extremely high performance, at least a 40% size reduction and it, of course, helps customers get to market very rapidly. You place the part and you're ready to go. So, overall, the trends \u2013 in terms of units we see increases. In terms of content, we see increases and more and more we see that favoring our technology portfolio.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. If I can ask a follow up. You talked about increasing content in the flagship launch in the back half of the year. Any context around that? I know it can differ depending on baseband SKUs. So is that a call in terms of where you're seeing that play out or what gives you the confidence in terms of growing content in the 8?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","So, from what we have visibility into in terms of our content and the architectures and so forth, we have confidence in growing dollar content. And that comment is not tied to any particular split of their platforms.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. First question. China was down it looks like about 40% in March quarter-on-quarter. What is embedded for China in the June guidance?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","For China, the June guidance, it's roughly flat, Tim. It's roughly flat, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, Mark. Awesome. Thank you. And then I had a question about this custom BAW product at your largest customer. They had a three-year deal with one of your competitors. So is this just beyond a three-year window or is this incremental to what they're doing with that tier? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Sorry, don't know much about their deal to be able to be specific. I don't even know when their quote deal started. I only know what we're working on, to be honest. Sorry about that, Tim. I don't know, Eric, do you have anything you can add?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","No. We can't really discuss anything along those lines. We're very excited about the work we're doing though. The complexity of the module is phenomenal. It's got more than a dozen BAW filters in it, highly complex combined with all the other RF functionality. It is the single largest opportunity in our space and we've had a long road competing for the right, I think, there to get the technology competitive, get our high order multiple extras (39:50) working and then demonstrate fully functional modules. All that's behind us now. We're in the running for the real business.","Operator","We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I just wanted to go back to the comments about the growth for the full year. I'm just kind of struggling to get there. Maybe you can help me. Just if September's up 30% plus, it's just hard to get to 10%. I guess you've typically not grown in December but I'm just trying to make sure I understood your comments correctly. It's plus 30%, really closer to 40% or 50% to kind of get there.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. Blayne, we don't have the total demand signal all the way out through the year, as I tried to make clear. There's still a mix of business. There's still timing of rollout of programs, all sorts of factors. We do believe that September will be over 30% sequential from the June quarter. We do believe, at this point, that December will be a bigger quarter than September. And then we'll see a normal seasonal decline off of \u2013 more or less off of December into the March quarter.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the OpEx side, I wanted to understand, also. You had one of these OpEx costs for a specific product before and I just wanted to know, is this something that you get the plus $5 million and then it comes back out later in the year? It's just tape out costs or expedite costs or is that the new, kind of, baseline OpEx to grow off?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Well, we, we should stay. And I'm not going to make an OpEx call on every given quarter through the year. We've given full year OpEx guidance. That would suggest we'll stay below $170 million. I mean, this is an investment worth making. So, we're working OpEx down in other areas in order to fund this. And we'll keep OpEx in control. On a year-over-year basis, OpEx as a percent of sales will go down. And I would anticipate that it would go down in future years.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. And then, I think I got this from your free cash flow doubling, but just, in terms of CapEx, for June and the rest of the year, what's the right range? You had talked about less than 10% of sales, but what's the right range?","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. There's a lot of \u2013 we can modulate CapEx spend based on certain requirements of capacity and again, customer rollout and so forth. And so, I hesitate to give a number on a given quarter. Plus there's just timing of payments and things like that. We paid a bit more in fourth quarter than we thought and gives us more confidence that our actual spend in 2018 will be 400-ish. But I'm not going to call a quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Burton with Longbow Research.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. So, just wanted to finish, sort of, the loop here on China. It sounds like what you said was that you're actually expecting, kind of, flattish in June. I'm just curious. As you look at the second half, following this inventory correction, it sounds like we might be coming \u2013 or through the worst of it. How do you expect, based upon your projected ramps with those customers, for that to progress? And September, presumably, I would expect some growth there before your largest customer kind of eats up all the supply on the channel.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","You want to take that, Eric, or do you want me...","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, we are projecting continued growth throughout the fiscal year until the normal seasonality in March.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","So, Mike, we are seeing the end demand, as Eric pointed out, increasing now. It's just we're depleting that inventory that was at our customers actually in their factories. So, the demand has already started to pick up.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, also on \u2013 sorry if I missed on 10% customers, but then I presume that Samsung was beneath that. I think in the past, we talked about some expectation to get Samsung back over 10%. Based upon your visibility in the second half or next year, how is that progressing and some opportunities, maybe if you could talk around that, maybe some high-end, or mid-tier, or low-end? Thanks.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. Maybe on the percent customers, so we had one 10% or better customer in the March quarter. One was very close. And then, in the June quarter, we expect three 10% customers.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","I think Eric wanted to talk a little bit about Samsung. It was one of the bright spots going forward, so.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. So actually, Samsung and Huawei both were 10% customers for Mobile in the March quarter. The opportunities at Samsung do continue to grow. We actually grew sequentially in March and we'll grow again sequentially with Samsung in June. So, we have a solid position there, but we're not where we want to be. So we're really focused on turning that around and gaining significant share.","We see opportunities to do that certainly by the next flagship launch. Also, some really nice opportunities opening up in the mid-tier in the portfolio, as it begins to move as well towards our strength and really adding complexity and higher performance. So, we're happy with the business with Samsung. We know we can do a lot better and we have visibility into how we're going to do that.","Operator","We'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I just wanted to see and get a little bit more detail. You talked about this custom product. I think they're your biggest customer that has BAW, PA, multiplexer switches. Sounds kind of like a high-band PAD, so what's different for you to call it out? Is it kind of the combination of mid-band and high-band? Or is there some other functionality? Can you give us any more details?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. I'm sorry, Quinn. We can't. What I can tell you is that we're excited in the work that we put in in the last couple years of developing an improved BAW 5 process, the work that we've done with the resonator performance demonstrating our ability to design. We talked a lot about hexaplexers, et cetera. That's why we're calling it out.","We feel very good about the engagement that we have with our customer on the application. And it's driving some of our OpEx expenses as well. And I think it's worthy of the investors to know that we're out there fighting hard for the hardest product to be produced in the industry for RF, but a very valuable part, very significant dollars per unit, but we're developing it and working hard to go get it. And we thought it was important for investors to understand that.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, Bob, you talked about 40% of mobile product reviews in 2019 would be BAW-based. Does that include any assumptions for this customer who had \u2013 if you got that socket, would that be something that drives upside to that 40% figure you gave for fiscal 2019?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","This is Eric. I'll take that. There's multiple ways to get there. There's a lot of growing opportunity for BAW and our BAW 5 has got a lot of adoption again across many cellular slots, as well as Wi-Fi, working it into even the China ecosystem as we mentioned. So, there's a lot of ways to get there. There's no question it's a lot easier with this module, but we can get there I think either way.","Operator","We'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys hear me okay?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. So, my first question is on content. Bob, you talked about growing content not only in Europe at your top customer, but also your number two, number three customers as well. But recent teardowns, some of them at least would suggest otherwise. And I realize teardowns can be spotty and oftentimes even misleading. But if you can help us reconcile your comment with some of the teardowns, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, that would be quite challenging when you consider how many fund models our number two and three customers have. But we have a very strong position at Huawei in the mass market phones which usually don't get torn down. And we feel pretty good about that. I also commented that it was a second-half phenomenon. So these phones haven't even been released, some of them.","So, I think, from that perspective, it's hard for me to say if you're comparing to what's already shipping and I'm talking about things that are launching in the second half. But we are confident in our ability there. And when we talk about our Samsung, Eric went through the mass tier and how things look there for some phones that they're going to be launching later this year, we feel good about our content there.","Also, we said we're going to grow our content. So I don't know if your question was over share or dollars. We're looking at dollars that we can drive and we don't always have visibility into who's winning what on every RF application. But we feel good about our ability to grow our dollars at our second and third, along with our largest customer in the second half of the year.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then I had a follow-up on gross margins as well. You're guiding June quarter margin is up 80 basis points despite revenue being flat to down. Can you kind of reiterate what's driving that? And then, Mark, I think you were kind enough to provide a bridge a couple quarters ago \u2013 a relatively long-term bridge for gross margin. So if you can help us understand what drives your margins from 47% in fiscal Q1 to 50% exiting the fiscal year, that would be very helpful. Thanks so much.","Mark J. Murphy - Qorvo, Inc.","Yeah. On the first question, going from 46% to 47%, it's a function of just continued traction, number of productivity projects, better yield, higher quality, items such as that. And then on the visibility to 50%, same factors are at play that I laid out, I believe it was November, and three major buckets. Manufacturing-related activities, wafer conversions, yield improvements, other items improve utilization across the fab network and that's happening through the loading which should occur in the second half and then the consolidation of some excess capacity into places like Oregon for GaAs and Texas for GaN. And then just a raft of supply-chain sourcing initiatives in silicon and other areas, gases and chems, and other areas make up the difference along with a number of other productivity programs. And that mix \u2013 it changes in any given period, but it's roughly the same as I laid out then.","Operator","We'll go next to Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Hi, guys. Just want to go back to that custom product comment. Given that you said it's roughly 12 filters and PAs and other RF components, I'm guessing the ASPs are pretty healthy? And just going by the number of units that customer ships, I would've thought that that 30% sequential growth is actually conservative. I'm just trying to understand if you expect the supply into 100% of the volume or you expect the supply into only certain SKUs? Any color on that would be helpful.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Sure. This is Eric. We should clarify that. This product is in development now and targeting a production launch next calendar year, second half.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","So that's next calendar year. It's not impacting your September quarter in 2017?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Correct.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Correct.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Just wanted to make \u2013 thank you. Thanks. And then maybe you can help us understand the 30% sequential growth in September then. Is it primarily because of the seasonality at your largest customer, or you expecting China to also recover in September?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Clearly, the timing of marquee smartphones definitely impacts our September quarter, so that'll be the majority of it. But as Eric's already commented, we're expecting continued growth at Samsung. I talked about some of the work that we're doing at our Huawei along with some of the rebound that we saw. We said we're already starting seeing end demand in China as well. So, all will be drivers. And let's not leave out IDP. James is having a really good start to the fiscal year as well. So we're expecting IDP to grow. And, James, you want to talk a little bit about that, feel free.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","I'd love to talk about it. We did have a great year, particularly strong in Wi-Fi, combining some of our best-in-class power amplifiers, our BAW coexist manage (53:09 filters and our integration capability has really led us to get significant traction in the market. So, we're focused on those high-end solutions of our customer and enterprise and we're laying the foundation for this new Wi-Fi 802.11ax standard coming through.","I also have to mention defense. A very strong year in defense. GaN was a big part of this, growing over 25%. And we're also seeing significant growth with our ongoing multi-year defense contractors. Of note our largest defense customer over doubled in FY 2017 from FY 2016, so that's a great accomplishment for us. The defense market is a place where our brand promise really comes true. Innovation, scale, speed, product leadership, those have really been the key for us growing in that part of the market.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you. Then maybe one final question. Bob, obviously you've been talking about BAW and the investments in CapEx, et cetera. It looks like your utilization is around 60% today and if I look at the China market, LTE is mostly penetrated. And the frequencies are fairly high and advanced 39 and a bell (54:35). I'm just curious as to why you're not seeing more demand for BAW filters in China today. Obviously, you're expecting that to change going forward, but I'm just curious given that there is definitely a need. And then as you look out to next year, what do you think will change that make the customers switch from TC-SAW and SAW to BAW next year?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","First, let me say a couple things. One is you are correct. Our utilization is low and it's actually lower than what you said there and that's part of what's going to drive our margins as we continue later on. But we've got a couple things going on there. We are seeing demand increases but as we're doing that we're continuing to reduce our die sizes as well as expand our diameters from 6 to 8. We're just really in the beginning of that as well. But just want to make sure that we're clear that we're seeing the demand increases but we're also expanding the capacity, so utilization doesn't quite go up as you pointed out. But I'll let Eric talk about the end market.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. So, we are definitely seeing demand for BAW in China, both for Wi-Fi coexist filters as well as for advanced multiplexors and, in some cases, even for other discrete filters. So, what's really going to drive it going forward is the increased complexity and as there's more demand for higher levels of carrier aggregation across more bands so there's more loss. Then the insertion loss of the filters is more important. So, high-performance filters have a premium and the new multiplexers that we're just bringing out right now on BAW 5 are seeing a lot of adoption. They'll be ramping into production later this year.","Operator","We'll go next to David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. With the expansion of your BAW footprint in revenues, can you give us some idea of what proportion of the incremental BAW-based units are going into new sockets for you as opposed to replacing your own non-BAW products?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Well, we can say \u2013 in Wi-Fi, I would say it's a little different phenomenon. We're picking up the PA portion, the LNAs and the switches, matching them up to our BAW. So, let's get that one out. For Wi-Fi, it's similarly growing the other way. And then, clearly, as Eric talked about the multiplexers for carrier aggregation and things like that, that's all new revenue for us. I have to think about the other ones. Eric, I don't know if...","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. David, did you say replacing our other non-BAW products? Is that what you said?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's right. Yes.","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. I don't think that's much of a factor at all. In my mind, I can't come up with any case of that. So, we are replacing our older BAW with our new BAW, but mainly expanding the market. The new BAW is significantly higher performance than our previous. So that's allowing us to kind of bring more functionality and higher performance to the market.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess when thinking about the, let's say, other products, such as tuning, diversity receive, some of the Wi-Fi parts you've been speaking about, how should we think about the revenue growth opportunities? And where \u2013 I would say what would be the highest growing? And trying to square away your comments to get to like a 10% year-on-year fiscal year growth and how much of a contribution these are going to have within that?","Steven Eric Creviston - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. That's a big topic. And, of course, as you know, one of the unique opportunities we have is that we can compete everywhere. So, we have the full suite of technologies needed to address each of these markets and we are trying to align on our best opportunities, not just in terms of dollar growth but also in terms of profit growth and differentiation. So that's where the BAW 5-based products really rise to the top there. And so, our Wi-Fi integrated modules \u2013 we already talked about BAW 5. Those are going to be large growth leaders this year.","As we focus on higher order multiplexers and then integrating those into modules, one of the cases is the one for China we mentioned with the MediaTek certification. That's got a lot of dollar content. It does have a BAW-based multiplexer at the heart of that thing. So that's going to drive dollar content, a lot of differentiation and profit growth. And then we have these big chunky modules like Bob mentioned, this customer product we're working on that also drive not only a lot of revenue dollars, but an outsized sort of differentiation or profit potential there to leverage the BAW technology.","Tuners, though, are another dramatic growth opportunity for us. That's also outgrowing our overall market. We have a highly differentiated position there many years and successive generations of pushing the limits of what can be done. And tuning is really beginning to increase its complexity and its value in the handsets. If you look at 4x4 MIMO, obviously you've got four antennas. There's a lot more tuning challenges. But what's not so obvious is you can use the tuners to actually increase performance in MIMO sort of applications. So, tuner is another great, great growth market for us. And then, of course, as well our envelope tracking power management, very unique opportunity there to enable much better battery life in very complex phone frontends.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that color and I'm going to switch over to IDP. Excited to hear Jim as well. I guess you exited the year with a fairly significant Jan growth and now you're speaking about new opportunities in Wi-Fi. Maybe a sneak preview into your May Analyst Day, but how do you rate your growth opportunities this year within IDP? Thank you.","James L. Klein - Qorvo, Inc.","Yes. I mean looking forward \u2013 we're currently forecasting double-digit growth again in IDP, pretty similar story, strength in IoT, strength in defense. We're going to maintain our focus on these six high growth markets that Bob talked about earlier: defense, space station, Wi-Fi, optical, automotive and IoT. To talk a little bit about GaN in particular, we grew GaN 25% in the year. I think even better than that, we've positioned ourselves for strong growth next year, perhaps as much as doubling our GaN revenues.","So far, our strength has been in defense and in cable TV and those should continue to be strong, but we're now starting to add wireless infrastructure into the mix. And we are actively engaged with pretty much all the OEMs on both lower power slots for massive MIMO and higher power slots from macro base station. So, I think, in general, we expect to see really good growth as we go through 2018 in GaN and our IoT slots will play a big part of that.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - Qorvo, Inc.","Thank you for joining us tonight. Qorvo is leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to address our markets' most complex, most rewarding and fastest-growing opportunities. We're expanding our product portfolios to deliver superior performance and functionality. And our customer engagements are becoming increasingly more collaborative.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I turn the conference over to your host, to Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas DeLieto - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks very much, Corrine. Hello, everybody, and welcome to our September 2015 quarterly earnings call.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.","In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.

Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Steve Buhaly, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call.","Qorvo's revenue in the September quarter increased approximately 5.2% sequentially to $708 million. In mobile products, revenue grew 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year driven by large customer product ramps. In infrastructure and defense, revenue grew 6% sequentially and declined 13% year-over-year with wireless infrastructure down approximately $24 million versus last year.","Supporting Qorvo's future growth across all segments, the global appetite for mobile data continues to expand placing a greater premium on the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand. This is a global mega trend that remains early in adoption and it's bigger than smartphones or smartphone product cycles. It is favoring the leading suppliers of premium RF solutions and it will have far reaching implications on how we interact within our communities, access content and transact commerce.","For smartphone manufacturers, the use case for smartphones continues to shift to more data intensive applications. The phone we once used for voice and texting, we are now using for streaming videos and media conferencing. Soon the cellular air waves will be home to immersive virtual reality content and other data hungry cloud-based applications. For network operators, the limited frequency spectrum they have deployed is their most precious asset. The continuing increase in the global demand for mobile data is driving network operators to seek new ways to optimize spectral efficiency and improve network capacity. Regardless of the device or application, the appetite for mobile data continues to expand and that's increasing the economic value of RF to our customers and to our customers' customers.","To accommodate that demand and fuel our growth, Qorvo's investing in the industry's broadest portfolio of enabling technologies and products. We're putting an increasing number of highly integrated system-level solutions in our customers' hands, and we're working closely with leading wireless carriers and infrastructure OEMs to help them increase throughput and enhance their competitive positions. Qorvo today is at the forefront of multiple long-term trends. In mobile products, we're capturing new opportunities as smartphones migrate from feature and value 4G devices to premium 4G and performance 4G smartphones. These performance and premium 4G devices contain up to $20 of RF content versus $2 to $3 in the lower end devices. They represent less than one-third of the smartphones built this year and they're continuing to increase as a percentage of the mix as smartphone units grow.","Those measuring generic smartphone unit growth are missing an important distinction. The greatest growth driver for RF suppliers is the RF content inside the smartphone and that's what's growing. We're adding new bands of coverage and enabling increasing levels of performance and that's driving unprecedented levels of functional density in Qorvo's most highly integrated products.","Take for example the deployment of carrier aggregation, which is adding RF content first in the receive path and later in the transmit path. Carrier aggregation is being pulled by the carriers to help maximize their investments in frequency spectrum. This is increasing the content and the complexity in the device and that's creating new opportunities for RF suppliers. For Qorvo, this is placing a premium on our higher performance filters and switches, while also giving us clear visibility in the customer architectures that will be supporting the majority of the RF TAM growth in 2016 and 2017.","We're also seeing a steady migration from 3-mode LTE to 5-mode and 6-mode LTE among smartphone manufacturers in China. Last year, it was estimated that fewer than half of the 4G devices were 5-mode, and we expect 5-mode and 6-mode devices to represent the majority in the next year. Again, this is incremental to the growth we're seeing in the RF TAM as 4G devices become a larger percentage of that total handset mix.","Layering on top of that, Qorvo has introduced new, highly integrated solutions that incorporate multiple dollars of content, including filters, switches and PAs. These parts enhance performance and reduce product footprint. We've already locked down several wins, including at our largest Korean customer, and the ramps begin early next calendar year.","As an example, we're combining premium BAW filters with high performance switches to intersect the growing market for diversity receive modules. The diversity market today is valued at approximately $1 billion and is dominated by lower performance SAW filter technology. It's expected to double over the next three years as an increasing number of these solutions require premium BAW filter content.","We're also uniquely positioned to reduce cost and enhance our operating model. Our two largest synergy opportunities remain the in-sourcing of packaging, assembly and test, and the in-sourcing of SAW filters. We estimate these represent greater than $60 million in annualized savings. They're progressing on schedule and the benefit is expected to favorably impact results beginning early next year.","Now before handing the call over to Steve for a review of the financials, let's look at some quarterly highlights.","In mobile, we were very successful during the quarter securing expanded content opportunities on marquee smartphones launching in calendar year 2016 and 2017. We entered the BAW-based multiplexer market with a family of quadplexers for smartphones supporting carrier aggregation in China and Europe. Those parts are sampling at leading customers and we expect production volumes beginning in the spring.","Collaborating with our leading channel partners in China, we also captured multiple reference design wins on next-generation LTE reference designs for multimode PAs, multimode transmit modules, switches, duplexers and multiplexers. In China, while we believe we've seen the underlying market fundamentals begin to rebound, we remain cautious and believe we've embedded conservative expectations in our forward guidance related to China-based handset demand. Qorvo has excellent long-term opportunities in China as smartphones continue to proliferate, as customers in China increase the number of phones they export and as the RF content in China-based smartphones continues to expand.","Looking at IDP, we enjoyed strong design win activity and signed multiple long-term supply agreements in defense and aerospace. In connectivity, we secured multiple high value 5 gigahertz PA and filter slots. And in transport, we won an increasing percentage of DOCSIS 3.1 sockets leveraging best-in-class efficiency, bandwidth and power.","One achievement of note in cable TV, Qorvo was especially strong where hybrid GaAs and GaN power doublers, saving operators 15 watts to 20 watts. These solutions mix and match our legacy technologies and capability and they're especially strong in power efficiency and needed in applications where power consumption is everything. In wireless infrastructure, Qorvo was an active participant in pre-5G and 5G demos at major OEMs and we sampled the five leading base station customers our breakthrough GaN high power amplifiers. We're also continuing to see incremental opportunities for growth driven by small cell deployments and the uptake of our SOI switches and GaN HPAs at leading base station OEMs.","In China, we saw industry fundamentals begin to improve and believe base station customer activity bottomed in the September quarter. We're taking a cautious view on wireless infrastructure in our December guidance and expect the recovery to be gradual.","Now, looking a bit further out in time, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting how our IDP organization has essentially repositioned itself to accelerate growth above what our legacy IDP businesses had achieved historically. As you know, IDP is structured around a diverse portfolio of businesses, all leveraging Qorvo's shared core competencies and focused on winning with premium products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies. To accelerate growth in IDP, we're increasing our focus on automotive, Internet of Things, data centers and Wi-Fi, and we're increasing our resources in those value streams. We're also targeting segments that don't appear to enjoy the same dynamic growth but have large niches that can be exploited with differentiated products based on Qorvo's technology.","A few examples include Qorvo's GaN-based products in the base station market, in the traveling wave tube replacement to the defense and commercial markets, using our patent protected Spatium Solid State products. We're especially enthusiastic about GaN as a disruptive technology. We're continuing to penetrate the defense market with our expanding family of GaN-based products and we're increasing our leading market share as measured by strategy analytics.","In automotive, we expect that by the year 2020, 75% of the automobiles shipped will feature connectivity. That would equate to a market of approximately 69 million cars and a CAGR of 45%. IDP is uniquely positioned in this market to deliver amplifiers and premium filtering solutions to tier one automotive suppliers.","In telecom and datacom, Infonetics forecast 100G ports will grow to over 4 million units by 2020, a 75% CAGR driven by the expansion of cloud and hyperscale data centers. We fabricate our low power linear drivers by using proprietary semiconductor processes that push the state-of-the-art in power consumption and bandwidth.","In Wi-Fi, where the CAGR is forecasted to be 18% through 2020, we're winning by enabling higher frequency performance and higher data rates and by solving complex spectrum congestion challenges with our market leading 5 gigahertz PAs and BAW filters. In the rapidly expanding vision of the Internet of Things, industry sources are forecasting over 25 billion connected devices by 2020, resulting in a 65% CAGR. This includes over 3 billion units for the connected home, which alone accounts for a projected $50 billion market for connectivity circuits. Many of these applications are undefined architecturally but will require RF solutions similar to what we provide today to the Wi-Fi and automotive segments.","And finally, we look to pre-5G and 5G infrastructure upgrades. Ericsson has estimated that by 2020, communications infrastructure capacity will need to increase by a factor of 1,000. That's a staggering undertaking and base station OEMs are experimenting with infrastructure solutions that operate in the millimeter wave spectrum to help them achieve these goals. These solutions will require advanced semiconductor geometries and leading-edge packaging, which are areas where our internal research is focused today. The pre-5G market is being driven by carriers looking to optimize existing spectrum through the use of small cells, distributed antenna systems, MIMO active antenna technology and carrier aggregation. These systems are readily served by new Qorvo amplifier products, using our production proven GaN technology. In fact, we're already sampling these products today to leading infrastructure OEMs.","So, looking from a high level, IDP is targeting the highest growth segments within their diversified businesses with compelling premium solutions using highly differentiated internally developed technologies. They're moving the organization forward from pre-merger levels, where both companies saw low growth trajectories, to today where we see IDP on a path to grow their business two times to three times those legacy growth rates. So for Qorvo across all of our businesses the industry fundamentals and our unique competitive positioning give us ample opportunity for significant growth. Our products and technologies are tightly aligned with customers, channel partners and carriers and our design win traction in our first year as Qorvo has been very promising, finishing the year extremely strong. Looking into 2016, we're confident we will expand our content across marquee smartphones and leading reference designs and will position to accelerate growth in IDP's target markets.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look of our financials.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Thanks, Bob. In the September quarter, Qorvo grew revenue 12% year-on-year, $708 million when compared to RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. Year-over-year growth was led by mobile, up 19% to $578 million. In IDP, revenue declined 13% year-over-year to $129 million due to the $24 million year-over-year decline in wireless infrastructure revenue.","Outside of wireless infrastructure, IDP revenue grew approximately 6% year-on-year. Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 41% of revenue representing the aggregate demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei. Gross margin was 49.7%, down sequentially from 51.5% and up from 47.4% in the prior year period for RFMD and TriQuint on a combined basis. Product mix drove the sequential decline.","Operating expenses were $156.8 million for the September quarter, down $2 million sequentially. Year-on-year, operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue growth. Within OpEx, R&D grew 14% sequentially as we pursued major growth opportunities, while sales and marketing and general administrative expenses declined. I should say grew 14% year-on-year. The realization of synergies is allowing Qorvo to appropriately invest in product and process development, while driving towards our operating expense model.","Operating income was $194.8 million, up 28% from the year ago period for RFMD and TriQuint combined. This strong growth was led by our mobile products business unit, which on a preliminary basis, achieved about 30% operating income, while growing the top line by 19%. Net income for the September quarter was $183.3 million or $1.22 per diluted share. This compares favorably to our original guidance of $1.10 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and investments were $195.6 million and cash flow from operations totaled $168.8 million. Capital expenditures were $80.3 million, primarily to address growth and demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 9.1 million shares at a total cost of $500 million. This week our board authorized a new one year $1 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to implement on an opportunistic basis.","In the nine months since Qorvo's formation, revenue has grown 25% from the same period in the prior year, while non-GAAP operating income has nearly doubled. We're proud of this performance and are excited about our opportunities in the coming year. Synergy achievement is on track, led by the consolidation of test and assembly into our China operations. We're introducing an expanded set of new products combining switches and filters and leveraging our broad set of competencies, including BAW filter and gallium nitride process technologies, and all of this is creating exciting new growth opportunities for Qorvo.","Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo believes the current demand environment and its end products support the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending January 2, 2016. Quarterly revenue of approximately $720 million to $730 million, gross margin of approximately 50%, a tax rate of approximately 10% and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.30, based on approximately 147 million shares.","We think calendar 2016 will be a strong year for Qorvo and believe we will fully achieve our target operating model of 30% operating income over the full year, while building a robust and defensible technology mote. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report December quarter results on February 4.","With that, we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. First, can you help us understand the components that came in a little stronger for you in the September quarter? Was it broadly a little better or maybe concentrated on a single customer? And then looking at your December guide, you typically have your top customers seeing strength, your top Korean customer declining. I'm interested in what you're seeing from the Chinese OEMs in the December quarter? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. From a overall business perspective, both the IDP business and the mobile business did a little bit better than planned. It was, I would say, a little bit broader based. In regards to China, I'll go ahead and let Eric talk a little bit more about this business for the December guide, but I think you have the moving pieces within our business fairly well understood as far as how you describe what was going on in December, but...","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. In China, for the mobile group, I think we are beginning to see some improvement. For sure, it's good, not great yet. But we're definitely seeing a bit of a rebound as Bob said. Inventory levels are definitely in check now. The 4G adds have been very, very stable so we're starting to see a pick up. Design win activity in particular is very, very strong right now. That's not going to affect the December quarter particularly. But early 2016, I think we'll see a really nice rebound.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Thanks. And then if I could sneak in a second. If \u2013 can you comment on your views of your relationship with Samsung and MediaTek? Bob, you said Samsung was a sore spot for you guys in 2015 and MediaTek held some great promise as it ramped its second gen LTE solutions. Can you update us on those relationships? And how you expect those platforms to develop for you in calendar 2016 versus the overall market growth? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd love to, Mike, but Eric would probably strangle me. I think he really wants to talk about this. This is a real bright spot in what he's worked on this year.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Well, yeah. Yeah, you're right. That's been a real focus area for us. And first of all, I want to point out, Mike, there's never been any issue with the relationships. So it hasn't been about relationships at all. In fact we're \u2013 we've had very long and deep relationships across all tiers of both of those companies. It's been about product placement and having the right products for them. And as you know, Samsung made the leap up the integration curve a generation earlier than we thought. We weren't ready as TriQuint and RFMD, but that's exactly why we formed Qorvo.","We worked hard all year and I'm much, much more happy with the content opportunities we're going to see early 2016 with Samsung; and really, the same applies to MediaTek. We entered phase two a quarter or two behind our largest competitor. We're now a quarter or two further down the road. We're seeing tremendous design activity there and I think we're going to see the share come back to where it ought to be on MediaTek as well, early 2016.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move onto our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Adam Gonzalez dialing in on behalf of Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask on the IDP segment, I know that there's been some varying views on the health of the China base station recovery. NXP and Freescale are saying it's weak. Xilinx is saying it's stabilizing. IDT is saying it's growing. What's your reality as you see it?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","James, would you like to take that?","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","Yeah. This is James. As Bob said, I think we saw it stabilize, bottom out in September, and we're starting to see signs of it picking back up as we go into this quarter. We'll see growth in that area quarter-over-quarter and it appears to be a fairly broad based return. We're seeing orders out of \u2013 growth out of most of the OEMs \u2013 so looks like it's the final stage. Now we're being pretty cautious on how quickly it's going to recover.","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And I guess my second question would be more on the mobile side. But is 10% plus, I guess the 10% to 15% long-term growth rate you've stated for that segment, is that still valid for calendar 2016? Or do you see that maybe slowing down to the lower end of that range? Just your thoughts on that. Thanks.","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","So, our view is that the market opportunity for us is in the 10% to 15% range. Over the next few years, we expect to be in line or better than that.","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Next question will come from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid results. Maybe just a little more detail on the opportunities that you have for content growth if you could. Do you expect these to materialize over the course of the year or be more weighted towards the first half or the second half? And then to the extent you're willing to comment broadly on the degree of visibility you have into designs for the second half, that would also be helpful. Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. I believe that was mobile product centric or just...","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's right. Yeah.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Eric, go ahead.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Sure. Well, we could say an awful lot about that. The general trends that drove 2015 are going to continue into 2016, 2017 and 2018 where we're seeing just that incredible increase in mobile data and the complexity that's driving in the RF front end. Adding to that now, of course, carrier aggregation being brought in, in multiple bands and multiple regions, it's having a multiplier affect really.","If you look at the complexity in those front ends, it takes so much R&D to get a phone to market that customers are trying to cover more markets with fewer models, right. And when you do that, that just fundamentally drives up the amount of RF in each model. And when you do that, the amount of complexity drives you to integration and that's exactly where we come in. And when you look at integrating all that complexity, it turns out there's a lot of switching in there and there's a lot of high performance filters and that's where we're well positioned.","So it's really more of the same, just increasing in complexity and content over the next few years. It's not isolated to any one or two or three OEMs; it's across every tier. So you've got some people in the performance range that are growing to premium and global skews, but you've also got those that are going from regional 4G phones up to multi-regional or even global export phones. So across really all tiers and all OEMs. We think the opportunities for content growth are very well aligned with Qorvo's investments.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up if I could on the BAW multiplexer technology. Maybe you could comment on what sort of interest you're seeing at the high end from customers, what the feedback has been and when you think this could mean material revenue? Thank you.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. The multiplexers were an important part of the portfolio to solve some very important carrier aggregation bands. We are seeing interest once again at all levels of the portfolio. At the higher end tiers, it's even higher orders of multiplexing than what we've so far announced. The ones that are in the market today are very well suited for more of the China and Europe, more regionalized skews, but we're developing as you can imagine hexaplexers as well and pentaplexers to complement the quadplexers we have on the market today. So we'll be seeing a lot of attention for those across all tiers.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. I had a couple questions. My first one is, Bob and Eric, typically, you see a little bit of a bigger growth rate in revenues to the September quarter. I'm curious \u2013 I know that China is down and it looks like it's turning \u2013 but I'm curious, are there other parts that are moving? Is there perhaps an earlier build by one of your customers that's involved here? Is this the normal going forward or just a one-time deal?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Harsh, this is Bob. I'll go ahead and take that. I think you're right. We are taking a pretty cautious view in the China market right now. I think we've kind of beat to death in our last call that we thought they got a little ahead of themselves in the first half. And I think things happen, timing of new program ramps and all of that, but I think this is more of a one-off case right now and it's not our expectation this carries on into calendar 2016.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And second question was \u2013 we get this a lot from investors \u2013 there seems to be a viewpoint that the growth rate in handsets are slowing down and that the China growth rate is slowing down. You talked about China may be bottoming out, but could you also talk about what your expectation of the growth in China is next year, two years out, however you want to take it? And then also how do you \u2013 the $1 billion buyback \u2013 there's not enough cash in the balance sheet so how does, Steve, how do you propose to fund that?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I'll go ahead and take the first part and obviously, if I don't complete it, Eric will add some color. But, Harsh, I think we have to look at a couple different things. One is for the China market itself, you have to remember there are people that also produce phones that are not Chinese. And some of these players out there have had tremendous growth in the China market itself.","Now what we do see is what we look at is the macro trends that I spoke about earlier of the shifts from basically dimes to dollars that we talk about as they migrate through their portfolio. What we're seeing is the China local OEMs are now starting to gear up for the export market. So they're gearing more towards regional skews and even some are going to global skews. I use somebody like a Huawei that will put in $15 plus into a phone. So that trend is continuing and we expect that to continue next year.","And then also we have that trend from 3-mode to 5-mode for those phones that stay in China. So we do expect the RF content to continue to grow like we said earlier in that 10% to 15% range. But I will say the China export market continues to grow and that does drive the dollar content as well.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Got it.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","What was your other question, Harsh?","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. The buyback. How do you fund the buyback, Steve?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","How do you fund it? Well, the buyback is valid for a year and Qorvo is going to be very cash flow positive over that period of time, which is a good piece of the story there. And then if we elect to, we will opportunistically access the capital markets to supplement our cash flow from operations.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Great, guys. Thank you so much.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Thanks, Harsh.","Operator","Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton will have our next question.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. This is David on for Cody. I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on the adoption trends of RF Flex and RF Fusion, maybe where you're seeing the most traction. And then also knowing that, that customized solution will be a little bit different, what's a good ASP range to think about for the RF Fusion engagements?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. It's a bit of a complicated question actually because many customers are working with both for different parts of their portfolios. So in general, of course, the RF Fusion is \u2013 well, it's really being used in two different tiers. In the highest tier you're definitely seeing that, that level of high level customization integration where there's several specialized RF Fusion modules to cover an entire global skew.","And then in the mid-tier, RF Flex is certainly picking up a lot of traction, of course, as people are going from more discrete solutions to a level of integration that helps drive some of the complexity up while still gives them flexibility for different band combinations. But then we also see Fusion coming into other tiers, like we mentioned a new product ramp into a wearable. And in this case, they're using Fusion as the vast majority of the RF content is fully integrated into one placement because it's a very compact high performance wearable solution where size is at a premium.","So really there's a wide array of applications depending upon really the flexibility of what the end customer is trying to accomplish with the product.","Unknown Speaker","Great. And could you maybe give us a little color on your capacity expansion plans for filters? And how we should maybe think about linearly over the next few quarters, what are the largest impediments to growing that capacity faster?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","This is Steve Buhaly. We do plan to grow capacity primarily in premium filters since that's where our demand is expanding most rapidly. And our typical pattern is to put new capacity in place during the first half of the calendar year. That's a little slower period of time and then to be well-positioned for the aggressive customer ramp that often happens in late spring, mid-summer. And we're looking forward to that this year as well.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for the time.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move on to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just two quick ones. You talked about the visibility of the marquee handset. Just wanted to understand, I know there's been some debate with your largest customer, but just want to make sure whether that design is done. And how you feel in general with your content there if that was included in that marquee comment. And then if you could just talk about in general your view into March, the puts and takes, you talked about being conservative for China. I was wondering, as you look into March, what gets you \u2013 what are the puts and takes in terms of your other customers? Thanks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. I'll take the marquee questions because that was in my opening comments and I'll let Eric and James talk a little bit about seasonality in the March quarter for their respective businesses. But I implied that to mean as there's only really a couple major players with some marquee phones and we're confident in our ability to continue to grow our footprint and expand our dollar content in their phones for 2016 and 2017 based on what we've got all lined up. Yes, there has been a lot of discussion out there about that, but it's really never changed in our mind. It's normal course of business and how we work with these guys, and we feel very confident in our ability to continue to grow with those accounts. So, James, you want to talk a little bit about seasonality in your business?","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","Yeah. In IDP, really being so broad market base, we don't see the traditional seasonality that you maybe used to in Eric's business. And we'll \u2013 we should continue to see growth quarter-over-quarter.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, can you talk about...","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","And in mobile, as I think everyone knows, March is a tricky quarter there. So a lot of moving pieces there and it's typically down 10% to 15% for mobile, but it's \u2013 you've got one kind of major handset platform ramping down sharply sequentially and another one from another manufacturer ramping up sharply at the end of the quarter, and exactly the timing and volumes of those ramps make a huge difference in how the quarter ends up. But it's too early to say whether there'll be anything out of the ordinary this year. We certainly aren't aware of anything.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now move onto Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Eric, just a clarification and then I have a question. So you said the Korean customer, your content opportunity is looking pretty good for early next year. Can you talk about what sort of product that is, whether it's pad, discrete filters or antenna switch module?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. The great news is it's literally across I think every product category we sell. We've got a wide range of products with great opportunities in that platform, literally discrete switches, discrete BAW filters, Wi-Fi products, diversity receive modules, power amplifier based pads and so forth. So we again, we've really focused on closing that gap on that platform and I think we believe the prospects are pretty good.","Srini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then, Bob, just a clarification again to the previous answer. So when you talk about this content increase opportunities in the marquee phones, are you anticipating any share gains for you? Or do you think the RF content itself is increasing and you just participate in that content increase?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's clear content will continue to increase as the complexity that we talked about. And then we'll just have to wait and see how things end up. But I feel very good about our prospects and our ability to continue to grow.","Srini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move on to Atif Malik with Citi.","Amanda M. Scarnati - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Amanda Scarnati for Atif. On Qualcomm's call yesterday talked about 3G, 4G device shipments at about 10% year-over-year next year with device sales at low single-digits, which implied that ASP pressure for application processors. How should we think about gross margins for RF components in an environment where smartphone units are decelerating next year?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think what's interesting is and I tried to address some of this in my opening comments that if you look at smartphones, they're growing, as you point out, single-digits, but the real story in our business is the RF content is continuing to grow and Eric spoke earlier 10% to 15% in his mobile business. And from an ASP perspective, given those kind of growth rates, we don't anticipate any change from the way the business is run almost the last two years. So, again, the RF content inside the phones is what's growing. And in China, they're going from 3-mode to 5-mode and 6-mode, that's significant increase in the dollars that are in a phone. So a little bit different in the space than the application processors.","Amanda M. Scarnati - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then just a question on the gross margins, there's about 100 basis point miss off of the guidance this quarter. Was there any impact from the transition pulling in RFMD's test and assembly? And how should we expect gross margins to trend going forward once that test and assembly is fully rolled in?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Yeah. So gross margins, I think fundamentally the company's running right around 50%, which is what we've guided for next quarter. Our mileage varies a little bit quarter to quarter depending on the particulars of the mix and I think that's what you saw in this quarter. We expect the benefits from our assembly and test consolidation to largely accrue in the second half of the calendar year as we intersect our customers' new products with our products tested and assembled in China. And so all \u2013 clearly, it's going to be a positive. There's plenty of other factors. I'll wait till we get closer to call it more specifically.","Amanda M. Scarnati - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","You bet.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co. has our next question.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Just wanted to follow-up, Eric, on the China comments. Obviously, I think you guys, on the last call, said that the China business, back in June, it increased by over $100 million quarter-on-quarter. Wondering if you can give us any sort of comments on what that business did sequentially in September. And then just from your script it sounds like you're starting to see recovery in unit shipments out of China, but you're guiding that business pretty cautiously. I assume that the delta there is you're going to continue to under ship consumption just to work down inventory levels. Is that the right way to be thinking about China?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. I mean that sounds about right. I think to characterize what we've seen, you're right. The first couple quarters of the calendar year, we saw tremendous growth and we definitely in retrospect shipped faster than the market at that timeframe. As we've gone through the second half of the year, we still see our largest customer there, who's now a 10% customer, considerably strong compared to the rest of the pack. And so we're very pleased to be supporting that customer. And then the rest of the pack has definitely slowed and most are not achieving their original goals that they set up for at the beginning of the year, but it's still good. Like I said, not great, but good, and it's going to return to more of a regular level.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for the additional color. And then one for Steve. Steve, I think in your guidance you're now guiding tax to be at 10%, sort of the lower end of your 10% to 15% range. Is that going to be a temporary sort of December quarter effect? Or does that carry into fiscal 2017?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Yeah. Well, it'll clearly pertain to the March quarter, right. We try to level set it for the course of the year. And as we look into the next fiscal year, I think I want to take a little bit of a hall pass on that as we've got some math to do on that. We are running through our NOLs and credits and yet on the other hand, we'll have more of our revenue going through Singapore for the full year. So I'm going to stick with the 10% to 15% for now for FY 2017. But I think it's fair to model 10% in for the March quarter as well.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Steve Smigie with Raymond James has our next question.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Sorry if there's any repeat questions. But I was just curious if you guys could talk about architectures a little bit on the marquee phones where if you get your typical tear down there, maybe four boxes typically on a phone or something like that in terms of pads or whatever it may be, but then there's also lots of other filters and switches elsewhere in the phone. So as a company, as you guys gain content, can you have it stay in the same sort of four boxes? Could there be more or less than four boxes on the phone? Just talk about all the different variations that could happen out there. It seems like there's a lot of different ways it could go?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Eric.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","I'll take a shot at it I guess. You're right. There's a lot of different ways it can go. And so, what you tend to see, I guess, is there's a generation in which there is an integration around three or four kind of large elements and then some discretes around it. And the next generation, it generally stays roughly the same in terms of the number of highly integrated component. It's pulling in a lot of the stuff that was outside before but then you end up with a bunch of other discrete stuff around it a lot of times. So there's no real one answer on that, but I think generally the trend is for higher levels of integration overall and in particular, I think, at the kind of mid-tier of the market. They're adding an awful lot of functionality and they don't have the R&D or the bandwidth to glue together 50 different parts. And so, they're trying to get to higher levels of integration, fewer boxes, as you would say, at that tier of the market as well.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think overall, Eric, I think people recognize there's different blocks. But I mean, there's a lot of content outside of those things. And that's where a lot of the growth that we've enjoyed over the years, still there's a lot of discrete switches and tuners and now we're getting into diversity receive modules and things like that. So, I don't want to over simplify it down to four or five boxes, but there is revenue there and that architecture does \u2013 and the lower end is moving more towards that. But there's still on the big global phones a lot of added dollar content outside of those boxes.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. It's a good point. It's not really just about the boxes, I guess that's what you're saying. Because if the boxes themselves have all kinds of different things in them but then also the discretes there are lots of different types. And there's opportunities to differentiate just as much on some of those discrete parts as there are in the big boxes too, right. So, yeah.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Thank you. And then I'm not sure, have you talked about 2016 overall? And I apologize if that's been discussed, but typically you say some color like, hey, we're looking for such and such industry growth and we expect to grow above that. So I was just curious if you've commented on what you think the industry growth is for calendar 2016?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","We didn't comment too much on overall for the company, but I believe we might have had a question earlier on the RF content will probably grow in that 10% to 15% range in the mobile business and that's what we'll probably grow.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Or slightly faster than that.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And my last question was just on mix of customers. So, obviously, there's the big guy in Cupertino and the big guy in Korea and then you've got maybe four or five big Chinese guys. How much is that of your mix? Or another way to ask it, how much business do you still get from like a Microsoft, Sony, HTC, all those guys down below there? And how important are those guys to continue growth going forward?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, you want...","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Yeah, I'll take that. Our top three customers added up to about 60% of our revenue last quarter and then that's probably not out of line with the market structure. Of those three, Huawei is the one that we sell both IDP and mobile products to. And then below that you have a pretty large number, a very broad diversification of customers.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move onto Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon. First, Steve, it looks like you're getting some very nice synergies on the operating margin line and the EPS line. Where are we as far as the initial goal of $75 million of cost cutting in the first and then second year?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Yeah. We're in good shape on both counts. As you know, we have a very detailed management process where we have a dedicated professional program manager who tracks all these things. And I expect to beat both of our $75 million commitment for year one and then a subsequent $75 million commitment for year two. We're in good shape for year one and in year two, it will be a bit back loaded, about two-thirds of that commitment pertains to this migration or in-sourcing of mobile assembly and test and the remainder is a pretty broad variety of items.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, great. And then previously you talked about the \u2013 your plan to ramp up the BAW filters a little bit here in the first half of the year. Where do you see the health of the industry supply and demand of BAW filters? And what do the customers do right now that can't get access to BAW filters?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Well, a lot of questions in there, but I would say that the supply and demand are broadly in balance. The reason we had capacity in the late winter\/spring is that it's a little bit lower demand period in the cycle and it's a good chance for us to add capacity for the next wave. For example, a lot of the diversity receive or carrier aggregation demand will be in the phones that launch in the fall and we'll want to have the capacity to support that as we approach it.","But generally, I'd say supply and demand are fairly matched. I expect that'll continue to be the case. We build this capacity based on our customer forecasts and while there may be an error in an individual case, in aggregate, they tend to be pretty decent.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","I might add to that, to your point about what happens when customers can't get it. I think the industry is beginning to understand the capacity curve and when the capacity is available. And some customers actually plan their production around the time they know they're going to be able to get their filters.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","And make longer-term forecasts and commitments to us.","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","That's right.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thank you. That's perfect.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks very much. So, a couple things, Steve, nice savings on OpEx this quarter. How do you expect that to trend the next quarter? And what's your plan for next year? Are you going to scale up with some of these CapEx expansions in BAW and in SAW? And then, Eric, the merger required blending a lot of people and a lot of different sites. You still have the Portland facility going. How is that progressing overall? Are you still working through it or is it pretty much finished in terms of organizationally? And how do you feel it's going operationally? Are you where you want to be? Or has it impacted execution, especially on some of your newer designs?","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","So, for my part, OpEx, I think this quarter and next will be in the mid-$150s million, so continue to be slightly down from what we just reported in Q2. And what was the second part of the question?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","CapEx, I think he said.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","What was the second part of the question, Ed?","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","I'm curious because your CapEx plans for, especially your filter fabs and then you have the pad facility, that I would expect OpEx to ramp up once those are installed in order to staff them and to actually do all the design work that you're going to need to (50:56).","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Well, most of that goes into our cost of goods sold line and by and large the implementation of that cost for bringing that online is coincident with them being used for production. So it tends to be reasonably well-matched.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think we can say, Ed, yes, we will continue to invest in R&D but it will be a much slower rate than what we're expecting for the top line to grow.","Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer & Secretary","Yeah. And consistent with our expectations of the 20% of revenue model that we have.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Great. And then on the merger?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. So thanks for the question, Ed. I couldn't be more pleased with the organization, frankly. As you know, the culture matches very good between the two companies. A lot of people have worked at each and so we had a lot of good kind of immediate synergies socially and culturally. And before close, we're able to already develop a new product development process that combined the best of both companies, a lot of lessons learned. So it was a great unique opportunity to kind of wipe the slate clean and come out with better practices and processes.","We have combined several of our sites, and there's a little more to be done there, so far completely without disruption. I'm not aware of any execution issues that the mergers created. So it's a lot of fun actually. It's a great opportunity. These product cycles, it takes a while to feel the entire effect of them, but they're coming on strong.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","In fact, I would just add, we're holding this call in our San Jose office. That is consolidated between the two former offices here. And it's good to physically bring the teams together, and it's good to put the savings on the P&L.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","So like that leaves my next question, on the MediaTek reference line for phase two. As far back as February at MWC, we were talking with you about possible share gains there. And you seemed fairly confident about it through most of the year even when we met up several times since then. And it didn't turn out that way. It sounds like Skyworks got most of that thing. Is that just \u2013 that's not an execution issue then? That was just a product issue? I'm just trying to get my arms around what happened on what was supposed to be one of the big highlights of the second half of the year. I understand phase three is coming. You're going to do much better on that. There were a bunch of other gains. But I'm just curious then, if it wasn't execution, is it performance? Is it, what is it?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah, so that's one of the things I guess we keep maybe struggling to communicate correctly. Up until even this point today, we're still basically selling RFMD and TriQuint parts, parts that result from the merger where we're able to combine and bring the new org and new technologies together. We're really just beginning to release the first one. So the integrated FEM for Wi-Fi, the diversity modules and so forth. So phase two, especially March quarter, June quarter of the year, I mean that's where each of the two legacy companies basically were in their product cycles. And we didn't have an org focused on that as a matter of fact at RFMD and TriQuint as well was not really focused at all on that market. So, when we formed Qorvo, we organized around it.","We've got a business unit dedicated to that market and MediaTek in particular. And so they've been really working hard all year and picking up a lot of momentum. You're right, not as fast certainly as we would've liked, but picking up momentum on phase two now significantly. And then we've been in line with phase three all along for the MediaTek platform.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think \u2013 this is Bob. Sorry, Ed. At a little higher level, I mean our share on Qualcomm reference designs in China was significantly higher than our MediaTek. And as you know what's playing out there, that's also worked against us.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Yeah. So basically, it's more legacy product that you were competing individually from the companies for phase two, whereas phase three it will be the combined companies?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a very good way to put it, yeah.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Okay. And then, Bob, that was my next question actually. You guys have gotten much closer to Qualcomm over the last year. Qualcomm of course hasn't been doing as well. But in the net of it all, is it a net improvement still for you both on the Wi-Fi side and on the LTE reference design side of it? Or because of their problems, it's kind of a wash?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, net total revenues. I'd have to think through that and I think you've got the assessment right. We continue to grow the relationship with them into more than just, quote, PAs and filters and sitting on reference designs and working with them and then to your point, we're making great progress with Wi-Fi for the IDP side as well as the mobile side working with Qualcomm, but I don't think we've actually done any forward math to be able to answer that, Ed. As you know, what we're trying to do is be strong at each one of the platform providers and each one of our customers because they do tend to move around who's number one and two over time.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","And then along on the same lines, Bob. It's clear Qualcomm is obviously (55:43) the leg of their problems. But they're doubling down RF360, they've been showing PAM IDs around China and are playing into that. It sounds like they're going to make another gasp in this area. I don't expect it will turn out any better than it did for the first one, given well, I think when we think about the technology. Is your new relationship with them make you the go to guy if their solution doesn't work? Because last time, kind of the same thing, right? You guys were shipping them an amplifier for their first version of it when it didn't work out. So I'm just curious, because you did get closer to them last fall, if this falls apart and they're facing a \u2013 and they need to ship, will you guys be the first one they turn to, to try and stopgap the product?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can't say what'll happen in the future, Ed, but I think in the past, yes, we've worked very closely with them when customers wanted a different solution. And I think that's \u2013 an important point is, at the end of the day, the customers decide. I mean that's what really takes place and in our business you need to have very high performing, competitive parts. And we work with them, so that we make sure we understand the architectures and where things are going. But at the end of the day, it's as much the customer, but because we do work with them, we feel we've got that leg up and that opportunity and that's why we felt our share was so strong with them throughout the last year as you pointed out.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Okay. Final question. Sorry for so many. So I knew you guys had won a DRx module on the Note 5, which congratulations by the way, because I'm sure you had lots of competition for that slot. But then Samsung didn't actually field that phone, which is unfortunate. Obviously, you had to allocate the filter capacity for that part, and I would imagine, I don't know if that was BAW or TC, but the fact that it didn't ship, did that free up some capacity especially in the Florida facility? Or are you still impacted overall on filters?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","You want to take that Eric?","Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products","Yeah. So as of now, at least, all of the diversity modules we are planning are based on BAW. So that was a BAW opportunity. Volumes weren't tremendous on those few that we were on. So it did actually allow us to have more capacity available for a lot of Wi-Fi coexist filters and other things that we are shipping into the China market in general.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ed.","Operator","We'll now move to (sic) Tom Sepenzis with Northland.","Thomas Sepenzis - Northland Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. I was just wanting to ask a kind of future question in terms of 5G, and how \u2013 is BAW capable of handling the millimeter wave type frequencies that the government is talking about potentially using at least in the cities in the 40 and 50 gig range? Or is that something that you have to redesign from the ground up to be able to handle those types of frequencies?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say currently BAW today doesn't handle those frequencies, but certainly, there's tremendous amount of bandwidth available in the millimeter wave frequencies that could reduce that need a bit. And then we certainly have a significant amount of product available in power amplifiers and other type technologies that'll play in 5G. I think it's also important to remember that 5G, we always see as a layered on approach to what's in the existing content in the handset today.","Thomas Sepenzis - Northland Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And we'll take our final follow-up question from Harsh Kumar from Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Quick question. How should we think \u2013 so IDP has gone to the blender here in the last call it six months. How do we think of IDP in 2016? What would be a good, normal long-term growth rate for IDP for us to think about?","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good question, Harsh. I'll go ahead and let James talk about it because in my opening comments I talked about how he's tried to reposition \u2013 not tried, but he has repositioned his product portfolio to drive growth out of what we \u2013 typically seen was the single-digits. We'll begin to see that this year, but go ahead.","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","Yeah. In \u2013 we've traditionally talked about the business in that five- to seven-point growth range. I think what you heard from Bob today is that we're repositioning to get that to be able to grow two times or three times that rate. That'll start as we go into 2016. In fact, it's started now. So I think you'll start to see our growth rates pick up as we go into next year and certainly as we move into 2017 and 2018.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Understood, guys. Thank you very much.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Harsh.","James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products","Thanks, Harsh.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for joining us this evening. It continues to be clear that in any market environment, the global appetite for mobile data continues to expand. That's placing a greater premium on the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand and expanding the economic value to our customers of Qorvo's premium solutions. We appreciate your time and look forward to meeting with you at our upcoming investor conferences and at our Analyst Day on November 17. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
