Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. ","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Moving to Slide 3, I'll start with an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic recovery was slower in the fourth quarter, largely due to weakness in Europe. GDP improvement in the United States and Japan was tempered by negative growth in the European Union. U.S. real GDP growth was 2.8%, improving from 1.8% in the third quarter, while Japan delivered another quarter of positive growth as post-earthquake recovery continues. In general, non-OECD growth remains robust, even with the slight decline in growth from China. Energy markets were mixed in the fourth quarter. Crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices remain strong, while worldwide industry refining margins saw significant declines, as did commodity chemicals margins. ","Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $9.4 billion, an increase of $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $1.97, up $0.12 from a year ago. The corporation distributed more than $7.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was utilized to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2012. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $10 billion, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. ","We continue to invest in robust projects throughout the business cycle, all of which served to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products, while supporting economic growth, including job creation. Our cash generation remains strong with $17.6 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $6.9 billion associated with asset sales. At the end of the fourth quarter 2011, cash and marketable securities totaled $13.1 billion, and debt was $17 billion. ","The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and marketable securities increased from $11.3 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential asset sales, which have not yet closed and, therefore, are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $17.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, of $8.6 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing activities had no net impact in the quarter. ","Moving now to the full year results as shown on Slide 6. ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $41.1 billion, up $10.6 billion from 2010. Earnings per share for the year, excluding special items, were $8.42, up $2.20 from 2010. The corporation distributed $29 billion to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $20 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2011 was $36.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from 2010, mainly due to acquisitions of unconventional assets, including the Phillips companies, and continued progress on our world class project portfolio, including the Kearl oil sands project. Our cash generation was very strong with $66.5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $11.1 billion associated with asset sales. ","Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 7. During the year, cash and marketable securities increased from $8.5 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential asset sales which have not yet closed and, therefore, are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $66.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, of $31 billion and shareholder distributions of $29 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash and marketable securities by $1.9 billion. ","Moving on to Slide 8 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion increased $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $1.3 billion, while Downstream earnings decreased by $725 million. Chemical earnings were down $524 million. Lower corporate and financing expenses increased earnings $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. ","As shown on Slide 9, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion declined by $930 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower industry refining and chemicals margins. ","Looking now at the full year comparison on Slide 10, ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were up $10.6 billion to $41.1 billion, an increase of 35% from 2010, primarily due to strong oil and gas realizations. Upstream earnings increased $10.3 billion, while Downstream earnings were up $892 million, and Chemical earnings were down $530 million. Corporate and financing expenses for the full year in 2011 were $2.2 billion, down $104 million from 2010. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses continues to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter. ","Moving next to fourth quarter business highlights, beginning on Slide 11. The offshore installation of our deepwater Angola Satellites project is nearly 50% complete, with development drilling well underway and targeting startup in mid-2012. The project will involve a subsea tie-back to the existing Kizomba A and B FPSOs and produced approximately 100,000 barrels per day on a gross basis. This level of production is similar to levels achieved by FPSOs at our Saxi Batuque and Mondo development. The PNG project is also progressing as planned towards a 2014 startup. Recent milestones include completion of over 130 kilometers of offshore pipeline, welding of over 100 kilometers on the onshore pipeline and commencement of piling work at the Hides gas conditioning plant. At Banyu Urip in Indonesia, we have issued 5 major EPC contracts, including those associated with the onshore and offshore pipelines and mooring tower. The project remains on schedule for full field production in 2014 with a targeted initial gross production of 165,000 barrels per day. ","In the Gulf of Mexico, we funded our interest in the Lucius development, which is scheduled for a 2014 startup. ExxonMobil's Hadrian South discovery will also tie into the Lucius facility with startup planned for 2014. Also, during the quarter, we completed a settlement with the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Julia field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This will allow us to progress the initial phase of development of this important discovery. ","Now turning to Slide 12. Construction at the Kearl Initial Development is now 87% complete and is on schedule to start up in late 2012 with an initial gross production rate of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. Also, during the quarter, we funded the Kearl expansion project, which will add an additional 110,000 barrels per day of production and is anticipated to start up in late 2015. When combined with the Kearl Initial Development, the expansion will develop 3.2 billion barrels. Future debottlenecking of both phases will increase output to reach the regulatory capacity of 345,000 barrels per day and fully develop the 4.6 billion barrel resource. ","Turning now to an exploration update on Slide 13. ExxonMobil maintains a balanced global exploration portfolio, which supports an active exploration drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, opportunities in existing basins and near field wildcats across the globe. For example, we are currently drilling a well in the Black Sea offshore Romania and participating in an exploration well offshore Tanzania, both of which will test new deepwater play concepts. In Nigeria, we mobilized the West Polaris rig and commenced a new deepwater exploration program in oil production License 214. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were the high bidder on 50 new exploration blocks in Lease Sale 218, which further strengthened our acreage position in the western Gulf of Mexico and leveraged our advanced seismic imaging capability. This technology will allow us to progress new exploration opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and other basins around the world. We also maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program. ","I will now provide an update on some of these activities on Slide 14. We continue to focus our drilling activity to maximize development of liquids-rich plays. In the Woodford Ardmore, we added another rig and now have 8 operated rigs developing this recently discovered liquids-rich resource where we hold more than 170,000 net acres. Current drilling is focused on delineating this acreage, which more than tripled in 2011, as well as determining optimal well spacing and drilling and completion practices. Ardmore well performance continues to be strong, and we completed a total of 31 new wells in 2011. In the Bakken Shale, we have 7 operated rigs developing roughly 400,000 net acres of leasehold. In 2011, we drilled and completed a total of 51 wells, including 18 in the fourth quarter. And notwithstanding severe weather in the first half of 2011 and increased downtime, our net Bakken liquids production increased 27% in 2011 versus 2010. In the fourth quarter alone, net Bakken liquids production increased 13% versus the third quarter 2011 and 41% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. In the Permian Basin of West Texas, we have 5 operated rigs which are developing conventional plays, as well as testing new liquids-rich unconventional opportunities. In Canada, we have had encouraging early results in the Cardium, with 2 wells on production at year end and additional drilling planned in 2012. Finally, we commenced drilling 2 wells in the Neuquen Basin in Argentina in December to test unconventional liquids and gas potential. ","Turning now to Slide 15 with an update on the Downstream. We continue to make targeted investments where there is an attractive growth opportunity. We are investing to help meet growing demand for motor fuels with cleaner burning formulas and to sustain the competitiveness of our refining portfolio well into the future. During the quarter, we completed a lower-sulfur fuels project at our Sriracha Thailand refinery, which will increase production of cleaner gasoline and diesel fuels at the refinery by over 50,000 barrels per day. Additionally, construction of a lower-sulfur fuels project has begun at the joint Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil SAMREF Refinery in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The project will include new gasoline and diesel hydrotreating and sulfur recovery equipment with completion expected by the end of 2013. ","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 16. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $8.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $2 billion as crude oil realizations increased over $22 per barrel and gas realizations increased $1.09 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $1.5 billion due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, base decline, downtime, divestments and lower-than-normal seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by the ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects. All other items, primarily gains from asset divestments, increased earnings by approximately $800 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $21.18. ","Moving now to Slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline, downtime, lower-than-normal seasonal demand in Europe and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in Angola and Iraq and continued strong performance in our U.S. unconventional resource business. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production declined about 4%. ","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 18. Versus the third quarter of 2011, Upstream earnings increased by $435 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $190 million as crude oil realizations remained strong and natural gas realizations increased $0.46 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects increased earnings by $50 million due mainly to higher seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by the impact of divestments. Other items, primarily gains from asset divestments and lower exploration expenses, partly offset by higher operating expenses at unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, increased earnings by $190 million. ","Moving to Slide 19. Oil equivalent volumes increased 6% from the third quarter of 2011 due mainly to higher seasonal demand in Europe and the ramp-up of projects in Angola, partly offset by the impact of divestments. ","Turning now to the full year comparison and starting on Slide 20. Upstream earnings were $34.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $10.3 billion from 2010. Improvements in global realizations led to an increase in earnings of $10.6 billion. Lower liquid volumes, mainly due to lower entitlement volumes in West Africa and base decline, partly offset by project ramp-up in Qatar, lowered earnings by $2.5 billion. All other items, driven by higher gains on asset sales of about $2.7 billion, increased earnings by $2.2 billion. ","Moving to Slide 21. Volumes grew by 1% or 59,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2010. Ramp-up of projects in Russia, Qatar, Iraq and Angola, combined with continued strong performance in our U.S. unconventional resource business, more than offset the impacts of base decline, divestments and lower entitlement volumes in West Africa. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up over 4%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement. ","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 22. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $425 million, down $725 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower industry refining margins contributed to a decrease in earnings of $740 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million. Other factors increased earnings by $40 million. ","Moving to Slide 23. Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings declined $1.2 billion, largely driven by significantly lower industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, while other factors increased earnings by $360 million, primarily due to inventory or LIFO benefits and the higher gains on asset sales. ","The full year comparison of the Downstream is shown on Slide 24. Downstream full year 2011 earnings were nearly $4.5 billion, up $892 million from 2010. Higher industry refining margins contributed to an increase in earnings of $800 million. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $630 million, reflecting the ongoing benefits from investments and refining optimization activities. Other effects decreased earnings by $540 million, mainly due to the absence of favorable tax effects and higher expenses. ","Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 25. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $543 million, a decrease of $524 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower margins decreased earnings by $230 million mainly in commodity chemicals, while volume effects decreased earnings $40 million. Other factors decreased earnings by $250 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax affects. ","Moving to Slide 26. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings decreased $460 million. Commodity chemical margins declined significantly, driving a negative earnings impact of $390 million. Volume effects increased earnings by $10 million, while other effects decreased earnings by $80 million. ","On Slide 27, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2011 earnings were nearly $4.4 billion, including record specialty chemical earnings of about $1.8 billion. Overall, stronger margins increased earnings by $260 million, while volume effects decreased earnings by $180 million, mainly due to higher planned maintenance in 2011. Other effects reduced earnings by $610 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax effects and higher planned maintenance expenses. While the fourth quarter was a reminder that the Chemical business is cyclical in nature, ExxonMobil's quality portfolio of both commodity and specialty chemicals provides upside benefit when commodity margins are strong and a stable, less cyclical specialties earnings base when commodity chemical margins are weaker. We continue to leverage our feed advantage, integration, cost discipline and premium product offerings to outperform throughout the cycle. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Both businesses delivered strong results in 2011, with combined earnings of $8.8 billion, up $360 million from 2010. ","Moving to Slide 28. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year financial and operating performance was strong and reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ","And finally, I would like to mention 2 upcoming events. First, in mid- February, we will be releasing our 2011 reserves performance data. Second, as many of you have already have seen, our Analyst Meeting this year will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, March 8. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson. ","That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, 2 somewhat unrelated questions. Can you comment on the status of West Qurna and how that project is going? And then the related part of that is, can you make any comments on adding acreage in Kurdistan? There's obviously been a lot of press about that. I don't think you've put out anything officially. That was -- that's the first question.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, let me -- Arjun, let me actually answer those in reverse. I don't have any comments to make today on Kurdistan. I will, though, tell you that in the West Qurna field, things are proceeding on plan. We continue to meet our production commitments and progress the redevelopment projects in West Qurna, and that's going very well. The common sea water supply project is also progressing, and we are in the process of finalizing commercial terms with the Ministry of Oil and other participating IOCs. So things are going well and continuing to progress as planned.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The other question was just on U.S. gas. Looks like your production ticked up here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the current gas outlook is pretty weak. You all, I know, take a longer-term view. Can you provide any comments on how you're thinking about your U.S. gas rig count and outlook and in light of what at least are currently pretty weak prices?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, thank you for that question, Arjun. That's a very topical item today, and I know there's a lot of questions and a lot of interest in the U.S. gas business and what we're seeing and what we're doing. So I might just take a moment and kind of address the broader picture of U.S. gas. I'll start by saying we remain bullish on the future of natural gas as an energy source. For those of you that are familiar with our recently released energy outlook, you know we are very bullish on the demand side of natural gas as an energy source in the U.S. And as we all know, given the fairly steep decline in conventional gas, unconventional gas will play the dominant role going forward. In that regard, we are very pleased with our unconventional resource portfolio and look forward to a major participation in that space. Now as we all know, due to record production this year and record storage levels and a relatively mild winter to date, prices have weakened significantly recently. I can tell you that we have not curtailed any gas production, and we're still running 65 to 70 rigs across the space. What has changed over the year is we have reallocated a large number of those rigs to liquids and liquids-rich plays. For example, if you were to step back a year and then come forward to today, we have actually doubled the percentage of the rigs in that fleet that are drilling either liquids or liquids-rich plays, and I mentioned some of those examples in my prepared remarks. So although the overall size of the fleet has remained about the same, a very substantial portion of that -- those rigs are drilling liquids or liquids-rich plays. Nonetheless, I can also tell you that we are still drilling dry gas wells. We do have a few of those that are required for lease maintenance or meeting other contractual obligations, but we are drilling a number that continue to provide good economics. As you would expect, with a drillable well inventory of over 40,000 wells, we're able to put those things in order and have significant optionality and flexibility to drill them, and that really gives us an opportunity to maximize the value of that resource over a long period of time. So if you look at the total market, we continue to be focused long term while making the adjustments in our rig fleet to head to the higher-value, higher-margin products.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, just a really quick follow up, given the comments on the Cardium and some of the oil plays, do you see the opportunity to raise your overall rig count more towards the liquids and liquids-rich plays, or a 65 to 70 kind of plus or minus your number for this year?","David S. Rosenthal","I think as we look across the year, I wouldn't expect the 65 to 70 to change a whole lot in total. But I think it would be reasonable to expect that we will continue to expand the focus of that drilling to the liquids and the liquids-rich plays, particularly in some of the areas where we are having good initial success. And we look forward to, again, bringing on some more wells there. So I think that's what you'll see kind of as the year progresses.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, obviously, with these PSC effects, you've had quite a significant step-down in volumes. Thinking about your analyst meeting, I think that the 2011 number was guided to be around 4.6 million barrels a day of production. You're about 100,000 barrels a day lower than that. Should we sort of reset your trajectory of growth from that lower level, or should we think about a structurally lower level you've talked about? I guess, PSC volumes, which I guess are now lost because I assume you're blowing through tranches there. Any change in how you're handling -- or somewhat of a change in how you're handling U.S. drilling? Can you just sort of update us on the outlook for 2012? And I have a follow-up.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, Paul. I think we'll give you a broad outlook on 2012 at the March analyst meeting, and we'll look at both this year and what the go forward. Certainly, if you look at our overall projection -- or production for the year, again, if you back out the effects, in particular on entitlements, we did, in fact, actually do a little better than the 4%. I think we had targeted 3% to 4%. So if I just look at the operational performance, we actually did as expected or perhaps even a little better than expected. As you did note, and as we note in the charts, we did see a fairly significant impact from entitlement volumes across the year. In particular, if you look year-on-year, it's about 124,000 barrels a day in total. About 100,000 of that was price-related and the other 20,000 was tranche-related as we talked about, particularly in Nigeria and Angola. So clearly, at the prices that we saw this year, we did see an impact. The prices that we were looking at and we put together our outlook back in March were a little more conservative than what we saw actually. And so that had the big effect. But we'll look forward to giving a fulsome discussion in the March analyst meeting of volumes and drivers for those going forward here again in about a month.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just more specifically -- forgive me if I missed this in the comments, but the -- there was a large gain in asset sales in Upstream, I think with Apache. I think it's probably there was a deal with Apache in the North Sea. But could you talk about what else was sold? I'm not clear what that was.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, we had a -- that was the biggest one. The biggest impact that you saw was in the North Sea. We had some minor other things going on, but the North Sea was the biggest deal and accounted for the bulk of the asset management gain that we talked about there that you see in the other category.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so that's quite specific that it was obviously more than 50% of the number was that specific deal?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, sure. Yes, that was the main item in that, Paul.","Operator","Next, we hear from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one more time, just on the absolute gain in the quarter on the asset sales that -- because it's  -- it's $810 million year-over-year, but what's the absolute number for the quarter? And also if you can give us the absolute number for the effects that took place in Chemicals, the unfavorable tax, I think, change?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. The absolute impact in the quarter, if you're looking on that $800 million, we had an impact of about $1 billion in the quarter was the absolute number.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then the effect of the tax incentive or tax impact in Chemicals?","David S. Rosenthal","Are you interested in the full year impact or looking at the quarterly?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just the fourth quarter.","David S. Rosenthal","If you look at the fourth quarter, again, relative to the prior year, that impact was really most of that $250 million that you see there. That was the bulk of it.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then last question for me, on your -- if you could be a little more specific about the rig count in the U.S. You said you've been shifting a lot of the rigs to the liquids-rich plays. But of the 65 to 70 rigs you're running, how many of those rigs now are running in the liquids-rich plays versus the dry gas plays?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I'll tell you, Faisel, for commercial reasons, we don't want to be that specific. I think what's important is, that it is now a substantial proportion of the total. And, again, I mentioned several examples in my prepared remarks, and you can see the increase we've had in the rigs there. So without adding all that up and giving you a total, it's been a significant increase over the last 12 months.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, then what about the lower 48 production of liquids, how has that trended? Or what number is that in the quarterly number to the volumes?","David S. Rosenthal","I don't think we've ever given a -- typically give a specific lower 48 number. If you look at the total in the U.S., that number has been trending about flat or so over the course, and we've seen a number of ups and downs there, but nothing real specific to highlight.","Operator","We'll move on to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, just coming back to the volumes, if I look at it year-over-year, I mean, all of it's European gas, and that's probably weathering the economy. But of that 214 of net growth, is there any other areas that you feel, as you look at the performance, that has disappointed you?","David S. Rosenthal","When we look across the year, in particular on the full year effect, I'll tell you one area where we did not perform quite as well as we would've expected would've been in downtime. For example, if you look at the full year downtime year-over-year was worth about 35,000 barrels a day on a decrease in a number of areas. And I'm pleased to report that as we came across the end of the year, particularly as we went from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we actually got a lot of that back. And that was a big piece of the increase that you saw sequentially. Other than that, I think as we look across the year, all of our projects that came online performing very well. The base decline performed about as expected. The projects that came online are doing well. And overall operations were good, but I think I mentioned off and on across the year, we did have some unplanned downtime and maintenance outages, and we are working on that. I'll say scheduled downtime was about as expected, so it was clearly the unplanned outages. But again, about 35 KBD. Other than that, we're pretty pleased with how things went.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then if I look at the cash flow, you've got $10 billion of total CapEx. You've got asset sales increasing. Should I read into this that you're going to be a little bit more aggressive about spending organically and then just perhaps selling some of the tail assets, or is it just timing in Q4 for that $10 billion run rate?","David S. Rosenthal","I wouldn't read anything into that. We had $10 billion in the fourth quarter. I think that was about the same as it is in the prior year. We generally see a pretty big ramp-up quarter-on-quarter as we get to the end of the year. Likewise, on divestments, and you've seen a number those announced that haven't closed yet and will as we move across this year particularly in the Downstream, I don't think there's anything special other than it's all part of our ongoing asset management program. I'll tell you, a lot of these deals are a long time in the making, some years in the making. And others come up rather quickly as the situation warrants. So no change in direction, no change of philosophy for us, again, timing and -- but we do have a continued program to look at the portfolio, add where we need to add, divest where it's favorable to us and then restructure where it meets all the stakeholders' needs. And I think you saw a lot of that over 2011. And again, many of those deals will close in the first half of this year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to make sure that I get the number right. And you're saying that the absolute asset sales gain in the Upstream is about $1 billion in the fourth quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, in the fourth quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that when I looking at from the fourth to the third quarter, the other item is a positive $190 million. Does that means that in the third quarter, we have about $800 million in asset sales gain, or that there's other things in there also?","David S. Rosenthal","Order of magnitude, that's about right. There are some puts and takes, but that's pretty close.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So what is the full year absolute asset sales gain? Is the $2.2 billion that you show us, either that is the number or that there's other things inside there also?","David S. Rosenthal","No. If you're looking at the full year number, where we show the $2.2 billion, yes, the full year for the Upstream, is about -- the delta is about $2.7 billion with an absolute of about $2.9 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. So absolute is about $2.9 billion in 2011? Okay.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In Europe, the European gas is down 730 year-over-year. How much of them is related to weather? And how much is actually that their underlying capacity decline?","David S. Rosenthal","I think if you look at the total amount, I think about half of that is weather and the other half is decline, more or less. Clearly, sequentially, third quarter to fourth quarter, we didn't see near what we were expecting.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I think you had mentioned -- I probably just missed that, there's a cash on deposit from the future asset sales. How much is that and related to which deal?","David S. Rosenthal","Paul, a good question. It's $3.6 billion that we have on deposit for potential asset sales that haven't closed. And although I won't -- don't want to give the specific details of what that relates to because, obviously, the deal hasn't closed and that means we continue to have commercial discussions going on, but I do want you to know it was there because what you have is cash without an earnings impact. And should the transactions mature and close, then you'll see an earnings effect some quarter in the future without a cash flow. But that number is $3.6 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When you suppose -- when you expected to close your deal in Japan?","David S. Rosenthal","By about mid-year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mid-year. And that until -- wondering, some of your other competitor in the Downstream, they are independent refining company that, in the quarter, they have some significant hedging losses due to using WTI to hedge for the long-haul crude supply. Wondering whether Exxon did any of that at all. Do you hedge and not in the defense for your long-haul crude supply in your Downstream? And if you do, do you use WTI or brand contracts?","David S. Rosenthal","Paul, that's a good question, and a pretty straightforward answer, no to all parts of that question. We don't do any hedging, and we certainly don't speculate in the futures markets.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to try a couple also, if I may. And the first one is really more of a philosophical question on your U.S. gas statements that you spent some time on earlier. We're all obviously fairly familiar with the XTO economics from the legacy portfolio. And I think it's probably fair to say that some of your dry gas production is probably challenged from a return on capital on an MPD standpoint. So has that given Exxon's focus on returns -- given the early revenue or the early dependence of those early wells on the early part of the production to basically justify the economics, at what point would Exxon consider basically zeroing out its dry gas drilling or indeed curtailing production? Is it a gas price or is it a philosophical decision that you just keep drilling right through?","David S. Rosenthal","Doug, I really can't comment or speculate on any forward operating decisions. The comments I made earlier really talk about where we are today and, again, the plan that I talked about in terms of what we're drilling and where we're going. But I really don't have a comment to make on what any future operating decisions that we might take.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I thought it was worth a try, David. The second one is also a kind of philosophical question. As we look forward, and I guess you'll give us an update in March, but you have an awful lot of long-life assets that are either already in or will be in the portfolio for the next couple of years arguably stabilizing the underlying cash flow, maybe think about it another way of reducing the maintenance capital. How do you ultimately think about changing the balance between dividends and share buybacks, noting that through all your share buybacks in the last few years, your absolute dividend payment as a percentage of cash flow has actually declined fairly precipitously? How do you think about that? And I'll leave it there.","David S. Rosenthal","That's good. Let me hit that in a couple of areas. One, in terms of the CapEx, yes, as you know, we are in a CapEx mode now and have been for the last year or 2 and will for the next couple years, investing in large legacy projects that as we talked about before, have all of their -- or most all of their CapEx upfront. Certainly, in the last few years, the Qatar investments would qualify for that. Now the 2 Kearl oil sands projects, Morgan [ph] LNG, Papua New Guinea LNG and those sorts of things. So surely, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a number of projects are due to come on in the 2012, 2014 time frame, and we'll begin to see both the production and cash flows from that. Without going too far beyond that, we've got a lot other opportunities we're working on as we've discussed, and we'll discuss more at the analyst meeting that we hope give us the opportunities to continue to spend CapEx in order to grow the business profitably. As you know, one of the opportunities we have, in addition to our ongoing drilling program, is the strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft, which we are progressing and progressing as planned. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, that gives us tremendous exposure to what could be a very, very attractive opportunity. Now as far as the dividend versus share buyback, I don't have any change in our approach to communicate today. We are committed to continuing to provide a reliable and growing stable dividend to our shareholders. And then once we've invested in all the attractive projects and opportunities we have available, returning a lot of the cash to the shareholders through share repurchases. So that's a long-term kind of approach we've taken over the last many years. And I would expect, going forward, although we continue to look at that all the time every quarter, I don't have any change to communicate today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","In the Downstream, between sales in Malaysia, I think, was in Q3 and then Japan and consolidation of fuels marketing and lubes, restructuring is become fairly, fairly meaningful in refining and marketing. And so my question regards the strategic rationale behind these moves, and whether you consider these actions is normal course of business or maybe more. And either way, do you know the productivity benefits that the company expects to realize from these actions?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, that's a good question. I'll say, it's really part of an ongoing program we've had in the Downstream for a long time as opposed to any specific change in strategy or event. We, like others, have been looking at our Downstream assets around the world. And where we have had areas where, in certain locations, that our assets are of significantly more value to others, we've actually sold those businesses. The resulting impact has been very positive on our returns in the Downstream, and so we continue to progress and look at those things. We've about finished up the retail conversion in the U.S. and that has gone on very well, and the earnings associated with those divestments have been very strong. As you mentioned, a couple of the other sales that we have out there in Malaysia, in Argentina and Central America that we announced last year, should close some time in the first quarter or second quarter of this year. And then the Japan restructuring that we mentioned here in the last couple of days, we should also close again by mid-year. So -- but taking all that into account, we do continue to invest in the business where it makes sense, the ultra-low sulfur diesel investments that we've made in the last couple of years. I mentioned some additional lower-sulfur and cleaner-burning fuel projects that are underway, as well as, of course, the chemicals projects that we have underway. So we remain committed to these businesses. But again, as we said in our outlook for energy, in certain parts of the world, the demand for transportation of fuels is flat to down, and I would expect us to optimize there. And where we have opportunities for growth, we will. But I would say, overall, if you look over the last couple of years and kind of what's out there now, it's been a very successful asset management program, and we're very pleased with it. But it is an opportunistic program, and I don't have any guidance going forward other than the deals we got there to close.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I follow. So -- and also, in U.S. E&P, profitability has been a little soft over the past couple of quarters. And I realize that natural gas prices have been weak, but crude oil performed pretty well. And so my question is whether you could comment on the cost trend that you're experiencing in U.S. E&P and\/or any other color that you can provide on U.S. E&P profitability.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Certainly, on the overall unit margin or unit profitability, we are, of course, impacted by the decline in gas prices. And while we do intend to give a nice update in March on the unconventional business in the U.S., I can tell you that some of the objectives we set out at the time of the merger are coming to fruition. We are seeing improvement in capital efficiency. We are seeing reductions in operating expense. We're seeing improved productivity on the wells through a number of things, everything from pad spacing to length of laterals to how we array the laterals in certain areas. So a number of both engineering and technology. Things we've brought to the table are paying off, and I think that helps mitigate the impact of the lower expenses or the lower prices, if you will. So from that standpoint, I think we're progressing well and optimizing again that portfolio. But at the end of the day, the profitability on a book basis is certainly impacted by the declining price trend that we've seen over the course of the year.","Operator","We'll move on to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","One quick clarification on the U.S. natural gas commentary and then also on the unconventional liquids. So on U.S. natural gas, with your unchanged bullish long-term outlook, any thoughts on being a continued consolidator in the U.S. E&P space? And then on the unconventional liquids, thanks for the color and activity there in the different areas. Can you provide some maybe IP rates? And if I can sort of shoot for the moon, well specific costs on the areas you highlighted?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, sure, let me hit those 2 questions. In terms of the first question, I don't have any specific guidance, but as we have said for a long time, I will continue to say we are always looking for opportunities that are out there and you've seen that in some of the acquisitions that we've made over the last year or so. We continue to look at opportunities. Certainly, as the environment changes over time, we're always checking to see what's available and what might be of value to us. But again, no specifics. In terms of the individual IP rates, I don't have any specifics to give you. I will say that if you look, for example, up in the Cardium, where some of the tight oil well rates that you've heard from others, ours are certainly doing well and at the upper end of that range. We're getting good rates in the Woodford Ardmore. We're looking forward to some of the other ones. But again, a lot of our drilling has been delineation in nature, and we have yet to bring a lot of those wells on production. So I wouldn't want to give specifics other than to just conclude and say, that program is going well, and we're very optimistic, and again, in particular, the Bakken, the Cardium and the Woodford Ardmore are all looking very attractive, and I look forward to giving you more update on those areas as this year progresses.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could ask one quick clarification on the Downstream, you mentioned the benefit of inventory liquidation. It sounds like you blew through a couple of LIFO liquidation layers. Any quantification that benefit to earnings more explicitly and then any kind of strategy around liquidation of inventories around year end, ad valorem tax purposes for example, or is this just kind of an inherent volatility in the inventory balances?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I'll tell you, you didn't see a real big change. I'll tell you the absolute inventory. The LIFO effect for this year in the fourth quarter was $200 million. And frankly, that's about what it was last year. So we didn't see much of a change in any of our businesses, about $200 million. But again, no big shift in program. That's kind of typical as we optimize our inventories at year end.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to ask really for an update on some of the other unconventional activity that weren't mentioned in the discussion. So I'll hold it to one, but it's going to be multi-part, if that's okay. First of all, Utica Shale, have you actually spud a well there yet? And are you -- so an acreage position around 75,000, or have you increased that?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. As I mentioned, we would be spudding a well in the first quarter of this year, and we do have one going down as we speak. The acreage position there is about 75,000 acres today, and we're looking forward to working on that.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Great. And then on the Horn River Basin, David, can you talk about what activity levels are like during this particular drilling campaign and if you have advanced any strategy towards potentially exporting that gas as LNG?","David S. Rosenthal","I'll hit the first one. We are. We do have a drilling program planned for this year. I think it'll be about the same as we had last year. And again, it's really related to evaluation and delineation as opposed to production, so a similar size program. And it's going to be -- I think it'll be about 2 wells, 2 to 3 wells, which is typically what we've been doing. In terms of strategies for eventual monetization, I don't have any specific information to provide other than, of course, with a resource potentially as large as that, we are exploring all of the options that are out there, and we'll continue to do so. And as soon as I have an update on that, I'll give it to you. I might also mention the Neuquen Basin. I think I mentioned it briefly in my prepared remarks. We do have 2 wells going down there. They are not completed yet, so I can't give you any specifics. But we continue to add acreage down there and looking forward to an active drilling program and really trying to test the potential for both liquids and gas. So that is active. Another country that we've talked about before is Poland, and I think I mentioned in the last call that we would have had the 2 wells down in Poland. Those 2 wells did complete in the fourth quarter. And while we did find gas, it did not flow in commercial quantities in either of those 2 wells, so we'll be analyzing that, evaluating the various characteristics of the shale there and working on our go-forward plans. I think that's kind of an update. If there's a country I missed that you're interested in, I'd be happy to talk about it.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Maybe just as a follow-up, David, what is the condition of the service industry in Argentina? Are you able to find rigs and pressure pumping equipment, or are things really tight? And then I'll leave it at that.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. In Argentina, we're doing okay. We have a -- we farmed into a block there, and the operator there is pretty well established. So at least for the activity that we have ongoing and the wells that we're trying to drill, it's not impacting our program. But we'll see how that turns out as we go forward and the activity in the area increases in general.","Operator","Allen Good with Morningstar has our next question.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a quick one. I know you said the reserve report was coming out in February. But could you give us any indication if any reserves from Iraq were booked this year or anything else related more to Kearl given the go ahead with the expansion there?","David S. Rosenthal","No, I think I'll wait and we'll, of course, talk about both of those, but both of those will be included in our press release. And it'll be out in mid-February, so we're only a couple of weeks away.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on Kashagan. Is that still on schedule for this year? And any update you could give there would be helpful.","David S. Rosenthal","I think the target is still for year-end this year, and I don't have any update for you different than that.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One quick one about -- back to U.S. gas. With 18 months having passed since you closed XTO, has the employee attrition rate been consistent with your expectations prior to closing?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, yes. In fact, that's turned out to be a pretty positive for us. It's been very stable. We haven't seen any significant increase. And on that front, things are pretty good. I think the folks over there are very pleased with the progress we're making in the business, in the program, the integration, the availability of technology and other resources to advance the programs that were under way. And so, again, that's been a positive for us.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick one about Japan. The transaction with TonenGeneral, was that brought about by Exxon proactively, or were you approached by the buyer in this deal who was interested in making this happen? Or just can you tell us a little bit about the background to that deal?","David S. Rosenthal","I really can't share any specifics along those lines. I can tell you, when you look at the restructuring and the assets involved and how they're structured and managed today and how they will be after the deal, this is a positive for all the stakeholders involved and really better positions that combined business to meet the market needs of Japan. And I think that's probably the most important part without getting into specifics about how it was initiated.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Will Exxon have any wholly owned refineries in Japan after this closes?","David S. Rosenthal","No, we won't.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Weiss with Argus Research.","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","I just have one -- most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one follow-up on U.S. You said that the rig count that's being used for liquids-rich is rising. But when I look at production, natural gas, as a percentage of your total production, has grown and liquids has actually fallen a little bit. So I wonder if you could just comment on when we might start to see that trend change.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. The falloff in the liquids is really just the overall decline in the conventional, as well as some divestments. You'll recall, we had a divestment in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and that had an impact on us year-over-year and particularly in the second half. In terms of when we'll see significant production growth out of the unconventional, a lot -- I mentioned some of the increases in percentages, although we haven't given all the specific production volumes, but we'll do that as we progress. One of the things we've seen is a lot of the drilling is really around delineating the resource and appraising it, finding where the sweet spots are, determining what the best approach to frac-ing or otherwise producing those resources, a lot of time being spent on evaluating well spacing. So I think the best way to think about this is a lot of activity and a lot of drilling and a lot of planning as opposed to being in a huge hurry to get a well on production and over to sales. But clearly, as that program advances this year and we continue to put in the wells and the infrastructure, we would expect to see those volumes increase at a fairly hefty rate. And again, we'll talk a little bit more about the overall program and what to expect at the meeting we have in March.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just some quick ones. For the Woodford Cana, what's your split do you know between gas and liquids?","David S. Rosenthal","In the Woodford Ardmore?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes. I'm sorry, yes. Sorry, yes.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, the -- I don't have a specific split number on that. I think what's more important as opposed to specific production is the emergence and the discovery, really, in the Ardmore Basin of the liquids potential. I'll tell you, if you were thinking about rigs in particular on that, we've got 8 rigs drilling liquids and 2 rigs drilling gas, if that was the real nature of the -- of your question. And so, again, early mover in there on our part over the last year or so and really looking forward to ramping up the activity there.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. With many of the U.S. liquids plays you, spoke of being in a delineation mode. Does that mean you're having to deal with HBP acreage capture issues, or you're just trying to get a sense of field sizes?","David S. Rosenthal","No, it's not really the HBP capture. It's really figuring out what we've got and what the best way is to go about developing and producing it so that we optimize the total over a long period of time as opposed to, again, being in a big hurry. It's -- if you think about it, it's what's the field size and the acreage position that we have, where are the sweet spots, and then where do you go first and then how do you develop that to optimally produce. And we do -- I will say, we probably spend a little more time than others working on the front-end design and evaluation because, again, we're focused on what the overall long-term value is we can get out of that. And that's kind of the upfront investment in time and resources that we've seen here over the last year. I guess the last thing I'll mention is, even as we're doing some of these delineation and appraisal wells, even that, we find some fairly significant efficiency gains as we go from one area to the other and then capturing those allow us once we get to really producing the resource. We're not starting out from scratch. We've already got some experience. So again, more to that as the year progresses.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. In terms of going from a delineation mode to development mode, how long do you think that will take before you get your comfort level to reach that sort of level or degree of planning?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, I think it depends on the various areas and the resources. Some we've had efforts underway for a while now, and some, we're just starting -- really getting things underway, and it'll vary. But again, I think what you'll find as the year progresses, I'll give you updates as we progress and really get to kind of the production level because it will be different amongst the various fields.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. What's the -- as we kind of look at ExxonMobil's portfolio in North American natural gas, what's the usage been over either 2011 or the fourth quarter just in terms of consumption at the refinery and even the oil sands level?","David S. Rosenthal","Kate, I don't have those specific numbers. I can tell you, directionally, in the U.S., one of the benefits we got out of the merger with XTO was an ability to optimize gas feeds into all of our refineries along the Gulf Coast and optimizing feed into there versus sales to third parties. So I don't have those specific rates, but I can tell you, we've been able to optimize that to the benefit of our refining economics. Additionally, we've been able to also, through integration, optimize our feeds, both natural gas for utilities, as well as ethane into the Chemical business. So that's ongoing. And probably, if you talk about integration, that's probably more important than anything that we have going on up in the oil sands space, so a clear benefit and one we're taking advantage of.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just switching gears to the cash position. When we think about ExxonMobil's potential uses of cash over the next, say, year or so, should we be considering potential underfunded pension liabilities as a use of cash? I can appreciate that maybe at the year-end 2011, they didn't completely finalize. But is that something that might be on the table as it's been in years past?","David S. Rosenthal","Again, I think they're still sorting through all of that, and I think we'll publish that number when the K comes out here in a little while. But I'm not aware of anything significant on the table relative to what we've seen historically.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Just couple, if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks asset sales gains in the Downstream. Could you quantify that on an absolute basis in the quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. It was about $200 million.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. It's been indicated in the trades that you are in arrears, or I should say, Baghdad is in arrears to the tune of $500-odd million on West Qurna. Can you comment on the validity of that?","David S. Rosenthal","Mark, I really can't comment specifically on the items that you mentioned, particularly in the trade press. What I can tell you is, we have an ongoing relationship with the Ministry on a number of administrative items. But things are -- we're working through that, but I don't have any specific on any one item. We work on issues from procurement to invoicing to payment to a number of things, and those are ongoing.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, I was curious about the Tonen transaction. 22%, kind of an odd number in terms of your retained interest in Tonen. Can you give me some idea how that number came about and, well, why it is that you would want to retain a 22% interest?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I can tell you, the 22% is -- represents the 80 million shares that we're keeping in the business. I can tell you, again, the whole transaction is really around optimizing the commercial structure in Japan. And when we looked at the various restructuring and consolidations and optimization of the assets in there, that's where we ended up. And it really represents -- we're not -- we're still committed to Japan. You'll see a large presence of ExxonMobil in there. All of our brands will be in there. We'll continue to provide services and technology. But it's really just -- I think, if you looked at the Japan market and how it's evolving, that restructuring was really kind of a natural next step in the integration of those assets and again, will position the combined company to better meet the needs of the market and add value for the stakeholders.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last one for me. You've got some license renewals coming up in Abu Dhabi, you and others in the consortium. I think the expiration of those licenses is 2014. In your case, in particular, is there any linkage between these -- the potential renewal of those licenses and the terms under which they get renewed and your Upper Zakum project?","David S. Rosenthal","We are involved in commercial discussions that are ongoing. But, Mark, I think as you can appreciate, I really couldn't comment on anything that had to do with the negotiations there or any of the specifics with fiscal terms or anything else. ","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everybody for being on the call today. Appreciate your time and questions and look forward to visiting with you at the March analyst meeting. So thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"8944":["Exxon Mobil Corp.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and once again welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","And as you know, before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.","Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the third quarter. We maintain a relentless focus on our business fundamentals, including cost management, regardless of the commodity price cycle. Despite the challenging environment, the corporation also continues to deliver on its investment and operating commitments.","Third quarter results reflect cyclical strength in our downstream and chemicals segments and highlight the resilience of our integrated business model. The corporation's integrated cash flows underpin our dividend and enable investment through the cycle to grow shareholder value. Year to date, the corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion, with positive free cash flow of $7.4 billion, even amid sharply lower commodity prices.","Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth slowed during the third quarter. In the U.S., growth tapered following a strong second quarter. China's economy continued to decelerate, and the recovery in Japan remained weak. However, there is some evidence of economic stabilization in Europe. Crude oil prices resumed their decline after improving in the second quarter, whereas global refining margins strengthened during the quarter. And in chemicals, both commodity and specialty product margins also improved.","Turning to the financial results, as shown on slide five, as indicated, third quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, or just over $1.00 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $500 million were used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.7 billion, benefiting from ongoing capital efficiencies as well as additional captured savings in the current market environment. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.7 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.3 billion, and debt was $34.3 billion.","The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of funds. So over the quarter, cash decreased marginally from $4.4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. There was no net cash flow impact from debt and other financing items. As you can see on the chart, the corporation fully funded all shareholder distributions and net investments with cash flow from operations and asset sales in the quarter, with a marginal decrease to the cash balance.","Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were down $3.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, though our upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs.","As shown on slide eight, the results were comparable to the second quarter, as lower upstream earnings offset stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs. Now on average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the near term.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, upstream earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down $5.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by $5.1 billion, while crude realizations declined more than $50 per barrel, and gas was down more than $2.00 per 1,000 cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $110 million, driven by new project developments. All other items reduced earnings by $70 million, where the absence of asset management gains were partly offset by lower operating expenses.","Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 87,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the third quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 266,000 barrels per day or nearly 13%, driven by project ramp-up and entitlement effects. Natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, primarily in North America.","Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on slide 11, upstream earnings were $673 million lower than the second quarter. Weaker liquids realizations reduced earnings $1.2 billion, as crude prices were over $12 per barrel lower than the second quarter. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings $30 million. All other items increased earnings $550 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange effects, lower operating costs, and the absence of the deferred tax adjustment associated with the Alberta tax rate increase. Upstream unit profitability for the third quarter was $3.88 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Year-to-date earnings per barrel were $5.81.","Moving to slide 12, sequentially volumes decreased 61,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.5%. Liquids production, however, increased 40,000 barrels per day, as new project growth and work programs were partly offset by scheduled maintenance and field decline. Natural gas production was 604 million cubic feet per day lower than the second quarter, driven by entitlement effects, weaker seasonal demand in Europe, and field decline.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $2 billion, up $1 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $1.4 billion. Volume and other impacts reduced earnings $280 million and $110 million respectively, primarily driven by higher maintenance activity, mostly in the U.S.","Turning to slide 14, sequentially downstream earnings were up $527 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $320 million, and higher volumes from lower maintenance activity contributed another $270 million. Other items reduced earnings by $60 million.","Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Improved margins contributed $210 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $30 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $210 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving to slide 16, chemical earnings were also flat sequentially. Stronger margins increased earnings $160 million, while favorable sales mix added $40 million. Other items reduced earnings $220 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.","Now on slide 17, we want to reinforce the importance of the corporation's focus on business fundamentals regardless of commodity prices, and this focus underpins our solid financial and operating results throughout the business cycle. Our first imperative is operational integrity, ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible operations, founded on strong risk management.","Next, we work to maximize the value of our assets by increasing facility utilization and reliability. An incremental barrel of oil produced or refined through improved reliability is one of the most profitable.","The next imperative is cost management. Reducing our cost structure is an ongoing focus in our existing operations and new developments. We also continuously enhance and right-size our global functional organization, capturing benefits from economies of scale, shared research and development programs and technologies, shared services, and common best practices. We currently run ExxonMobil with about the same number of employees as Exxon had just prior to the merger with Mobil.","We are also quick to capture market cost savings. Our global procurement organization is dedicated to capturing the lowest lifecycle costs for goods and services. As you can see in the chart on the left, we are achieving significant market savings in the current business climate. So far this year, we've achieved a net reduction of $8 billion in capital and cash operating costs. And I'll note that this amount is in addition to the $4.5 billion decrease in planned 2015 CapEx relative to 2014 spend. Further in the upstream, unit costs are down about 10% year to date compared to last year.","And finally, our longstanding track record of superior project execution is a distinguishing characteristic of ExxonMobil, and results in higher-return capital-efficient assets due to a lower capital base and on-time delivery.","Turning to slide 18, through our differentiated project development capability, we are unlocking the value of our deep and diverse upstream portfolio. Excellent progress has been made on our investment plans to start up 32 major projects between 2012 and 2017. We've started up 21 of these projects, including five this year, which added more than 750,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. More than 90% of these volumes are liquids or liquids linked to LNG.","We are achieving a strong reliability from our projects, including more recent startups such as Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 in Angola, Hadrian South in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Kearl expansion in Canada. The Papua New Guinea LNG project continues to achieve exceptional results. From its early startup in 2014 and quick ramp up to full capacity, the project has produced nearly 9 million gross tons of high-quality LNG and has delivered more than 125 cargoes to customers.","Now since startup, we have progressed low-cost debottlenecking activities to enhance production rates. Our systematic approach has increased gross capacity of the PNG LNG project from 6.9 million to 7.3 million tons per year. This is yet another example of ExxonMobil's constant focus on maximizing the value of installed capacity and improving profitability.","Two additional capital-efficient projects were commissioned in September. In Nigeria, Erha North Phase 2 started up five months ahead of schedule and $400 million under budget. This subsea development ties back to existing infrastructure, shown in the photo, avoiding the need for another FPSO vessel. Gross peak production is estimated at 65,000 barrels of oil per day and will increase total Erha North field production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day.","Also in September, the first ever subsea compression facility started up at \u00c5sgard in the Norwegian North Sea at a depth of nearly 1,000 feet. This is a prime example of developing and applying advanced technologies to unlock previously uneconomic reserves. At peak, the project is expected to add gross production of approximately 40,000 barrels of oil and more than 400 million cubic feet of gas per day.","And finally in Indonesia, at the Banyu Urip development, startup of the central processing facility is expected by year end, enabling gross production to ramp up to more than 200,000 barrels per day.","Moving now to exploration on slide 19, we continue high-grading our 92 billion barrel resource base through new opportunity captures and leveraging the benefits of a softer market as we progress our exploration activities. Offshore Guyana, we are conducting the largest 3-D seismic survey in the company's history to evaluate the resource potential of the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. Additional exploration drilling is planned in the first half of 2016.","Offshore Nigeria, we secured interests in two high-potential blocks, building upon our 800,000 acre position. These blocks are adjacent to where we made two discoveries last year. Future developments could tie back to the nearby Usan FPSO, which is operated by ExxonMobil.","And in the U.S. Permian, we acquired rights to 48,000 acres in the core of the Midland Basin adjacent to existing operations. We have grown our operated portfolio in the basin to over 135,000 net acres from a series of acquisitions during the last two years.","Turning to slide 20 and an update on our downstream business, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales, we recently announced the expansion of our hydrocracker unit at the Rotterdam refinery, shown in the picture to the left. The project will utilize ExxonMobil's proprietary hydrocracking technology, efficiently producing Group II premium lube-based stocks and ultra-low-sulfur diesel to meet growing market demand.","The Rotterdam refinery is fully integrated with our chemical manufacturing. The hydrocracker project will increase production of higher-value products and further strengthen the refinery's position as a leader in the European refining industry. Construction is expected to begin in 2016, with startup projected in 2018. This project along with recently completed basestock capacity expansions at our Baytown, Texas and Singapore refineries will further enhance our position as the world's largest producer of lube-based stocks.","Now in addition to these capacity expansions, we are investing across our lubricants value chain. At our petrochemical complex in Singapore, we announced the construction of a new synthetic lubricant blending plant to extend the production of Mobil 1, our flagship synthetic engine oil brand. This new plant will employ innovative blending technologies, drive increased operating efficiency, and enable us to support the growing Asian market demand for premium synthetic lubricants. Startup has been planned in 2017.","Moving now to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow on slide 21, this graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash. Our integrated businesses provided $26 billion of cash flow from operations, which supports shareholder distributions and funds our investments. The scale of these cash flows and our balance sheet strength provide the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion funded shareholder distributions and nearly all of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a small increase in debt financing. These investments have attractive financial returns and justify the additional leverage.","Our objective is to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.73 are up 5.8% versus the third quarter of 2014.","We have also maintained the share buyback program, but have prudently tapered it over the past nine months, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.","And finally, year to date, the corporation has generated $7.4 billion free cash flow, reflecting the performance of our integrated businesses and our disciplined capital allocation approach.","So I would now like to conclude this morning's comments with just a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through the end of the third quarter, ExxonMobil earned $13.4 billion, reflecting the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value throughout the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong downstream and chemical results.","Upstream production volumes increased to 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 2.7% year on year. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. We remain on track to achieve our production target of 4.1 million barrels per day for the full year, with additional project ramp-up and seasonal gas production increases throughout the fourth quarter.","Solid operating results combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion and free cash flow of $7.4 billion.","Our commitment to shareholders remains strong, as the corporation distributed $11.5 billion through the end of the third quarter. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle.","This concludes my prepared remarks, and I certainly would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple, one housekeeping and one strategic question, if I may. Just on housekeeping. This quarter I guess the number that jumped out to us was your tax rate, and I'm just trying to understand. Is that just a mix effect, or is there anything thing unusual going on there that we should be aware of? Put another way, if we had a sustained low oil price environment, I'm guessing we would expect that the tax rate would remain at depressed levels. Is that fair?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, well, the tax rate, if you think about it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, Doug, it's down just shy of 12%, and there are two components. One, as you said, is the mix effect across our business segments and geographies, same as what you've heard from us the prior quarters. There was also a one-time tax-related item that reduced the tax rate by about 3%. So we're still consistent with our guidance that assuming the current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we would anticipate an effective tax rate between 35% and 40%. If you unwind the 3% one-time impact in the third quarter, that takes you up to 35%. And if you look at year to date, our effective tax rate is about 37%. So our guidance of 35% to 40% is right on.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To be clear, that's a consolidated rate, or does that include affiliates? That's just consolidated, right?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","That's consolidated.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, okay. My follow-up is I guess I'm going to go with Guyana. So one of your partners is suggesting that there's a reasonable potential for an early production system here, and I'm just wondering. Given as operator, you're the source of all knowledge, so to speak, can you give us some idea as to how you're thinking internally about scale opportunity given just the embryonic nature of this whole situation? Although there's an early production system plan, and I know there are a lot of embedded questions there. But the relative importance that Exxon is giving this within your general portfolio in terms of personnel allocation and things of that nature, just a broad feel as to how you're thinking about what looks like a fairly interesting area. I'll leave it there, thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure, Doug. Let me step back first and just remind you. The exploration program as a whole is really designed to ensure that we're targeting opportunities that will high-grade our resource portfolio. As you heard from us earlier this year, we're very encouraged with the initial result of Guyana. As I've said previously, Doug, and as you seemed to imply, we've got one well in an area that's very large, 6.6 million acres. We're very encouraged by the initial results. As I said in my prepared comments, we do have a very active seismic program underway that is informing us as we put together our plans for some drilling activity in the first half. Obviously, we're taking all that information real time and we're incorporating it into our thinking. But it is really too early for us to share any specific plans. But rest assured, Doug. We will look at the full range of development options to see how we can best monetize the resource with the objective of achieving optimized return on investment.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate the answer.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","So I have a point of clarification as well. What was the asset sale that was highlighted on slide six? And was this $500 million after-tax amount included in the operating earnings; that is, in the $1.01 per share?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","So the $500 million from cash flow represents a number of multiple assets. As we've said historically, Doug, we have as part of a key component of our business is a very active asset management plan to high-grade our portfolio.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Sure.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","So the $500 million positive cash impact really represents many different transactions that occurred over the quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, it was the absence of a trade that we did third quarter of last year.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay, I see. And also on capital spending, it's running about 20% below last year's level. And while the gap seems to have narrowed somewhat versus the recent quarters, it actually widened versus the first half in the upstream. So my question is whether or not you could provide some color on the spending trends and also any insight that you may have on the trend for 2016 in light of the pretty significant changes that are being announced by some of your competitors; that is, if you have any guidance at this point.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure, Doug. I'll say in short that our CapEx guidance has not been changed.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","We're still saying \u2013 have guidance for this year at $34 billion, and 2016 and 2017 below $34 billion. Of course, we'll provide an update in the analyst meeting in March. But as I alluded to last quarter and you see in the savings I talked about year to date, we are seeing substantial capital efficiencies on the CapEx side. We are running lower than our plan, and it is reasonable to extrapolate that to a year-end number that will bring us below our $34 billion.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","And thinking forward, Doug, I'd also say that those type of efficiencies and improvements that we're capturing, including market savings and a stronger U.S. dollar, will be extrapolated forward into the 2016 and 2017 programs.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Brad.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just following up on the past question, obviously you identified $8 billion in cost savings so far. I'm curious what inning we're in, if you will, as far as cost savings go. Do you feel like you've harvested the majority of savings that you expect to have as a result of the downturn, or is there a lot more to come?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Brad, I think just stepping back, we are never satisfied with our cost structure. We are, as was clearly mentioned many times, we're always working to reduce the structural cost in our business. So I would never tell you that we're done. Within the market capture, the market benefits, we continue to work actively with our service providers to identify innovative lower-cost solutions that end up being win-win solutions outcomes because they know we've got the financial capability to invest if we have the right cost structure and ultimately the right economics. So we're actively pursuing additional opportunities, and our expectation is that we'll continue to drive meaningful improvement in our cost structure while maintaining high operational integrity.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then thinking about onshore U.S., can you talk about the current rig count across your three major basins? There was obviously a big decline last quarter. Can you talk through how much of \u2013 if it's declined further, how much of that is just pure efficiencies versus the amount of activity you'd like to have?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","It's probably both of that. It's both efficiency as well as an intentional effort to manage our spend given the business climate. Right now, currently we've got running about 32 rigs in our Lower 48 onshore rig activity. That is down from our peak. And you know, in essence, it's down because of the reasons I've already stated, and that is we continue to see significant improvements in operational performance, cost, and productivity. So while the rig count is down, part of that is offset by the improvement in performance. But the second part of it again is due to a deliberate effort to manage within our means.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just first to follow up on the CapEx, on the $8 billion of cost savings year to date, can you give us color of the composition in that reduction between capital and cash costs? I thought I heard you say that's in addition to the $4.5 billion step-down from 2014 to 2015.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, Evan. It is in addition to the $4.5 billion. So the $8 billion is really from our target, our CapEx guidance that we had provided. In terms of the split between CapEx and OpEx, generally speaking, I'd just tell you it's a little over $1 billion CapEx. The rest is OpEx, cash OpEx.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it; that helps as we think about 2016. And my second question is on LNG. I know there's a mix in contract durations within your global LNG portfolio, and it changes over time as contracts, some contracts reopen as had been reported. But can you quantify the aggregate spot market exposure in your portfolio for Exxon into 2016?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I can generally tell you that it's a fairly low component of our portfolio. Remember, our LNG projects continue to be a key component of our portfolio, and it is a very important part of our margin generation. And as you may have heard us say in the past, when we go to FID on these big multibillion dollar complex LNG projects, we typically contract under long terms our LNG volumes, our proved LNG or proved reserves, with a very little bit left for spot.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So less than 10%, is that a fair assumption?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","That's a fair assumption.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a quick follow-up on the capital cost reduction number. Would you say that there has been a significant impact this year to pulling forward any capital spending to take advantage of this environment that as we look ahead to next year, you could actually have a good year-over-year benefit from that?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, clearly the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to continue to invest through the cycle provides an added benefit. Those projects that are in execution right now coupled with the capability of our global procurement organization to capture market savings allows us to leverage those benefits in the current projects. Likewise, if you rewind a bit to our discussion around the Lower 48 unconventional activity, we are taking full advantage of high-grading the services that were provided. We're very well positioned to advance certain commodity purchases, but rest assured we're taking full benefit of the current market climate.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there any way to quantify the benefit of pull-forward plus project roll-off?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","No, Phil, it's really hard to do that. The business is very expansive in terms of scope and scale. A lot of those cost savings vary dramatically between asset and geographic regions. So it's really difficult for us to go ahead and break that down further.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, understood. And my follow-up question is just on the M&A bid\/ask spreads. Other companies have sounded a bit more upbeat. I know in the past you've said you think they're too wide still. So has anything changed there in the past few months? And with respect to how wide they've been for how long, has that surprised you at all given where we are in the cycle relative to past cycles?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","All I can really say about it is as you would envision. The bid\/ask price is really a function of a number of factors, obviously including the business climate. But also what I would tell you is the unique capability and assessment from individual investors. Certainly as commodity prices remain low, it will impact the dynamics. I really don't have a view to share with respect to where it's going. I would tell you from our perspective, it's business as normal. As you've heard me say several times, Phil, this is a key component of our ongoing business, not only acquisitions but high-grading our portfolio from divestments. I would simply just say that any acquisition will have to compete with our diverse inventory of investment opportunities.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Jeff, I wanted you to comment a little bit on the downstream here. And maybe we start off with some of the announced divestments, Chalmette and Torrance. Talk through a little bit of the strategic logic behind divesting those assets, and then what we can read, if any, from how you think about the downstream portfolio as a percentage as the mix of the company.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure, Neil. Maybe I can start with just a reminder for the group that, as I said a moment ago, this is a very important part of our overall business activities, the asset management focus. And from a downstream perspective, if you look at the last decade, we have divested more than 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, something like 6,000 miles of pipeline, and over 200 fuel terminals. And I start there because it just highlights that we continue to high-grade the portfolio. And it really talks to our effort towards enhancing our portfolio through identifying appropriate investment opportunities like you're seeing in Rotterdam, in Singapore, focusing on risk balancing on our portfolio, and then pursuing monetization opportunities.","Obviously, there are a lot of variables that go into such a decision for the downstream, including our large manufacturing footprint in the U.S. But ultimately the right decision for us was to monetize those assets and to continue to focus our investments on areas that will upgrade our existing portfolio. Many of our sites being advantaged, a lot of those investments focused on things like expanding our feedstock flexibility, like you see in our plans to expand the Beaumont refinery, like expanding our logistics flexibility like we talked about previously with the Edmonton rail terminal. Expanding our higher-yield, higher-value products, which you're seeing with the Rotterdam refinery and the Antwerp refinery. And underlying all of that is further capturing increased value from our integrated business model.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then the follow-up question, Jeff, is a follow-up to Phil's question around M&A. And as you think about the U.S. unconventional business, you did a tuck-in here of 48,000 acres in the Permian. Is that the right strategy for Exxon to continue to look for incremental bolt-on acquisitions of acreage that you can tuck into the portfolio under XTO, or does larger-scale M&A of U.S. conventional assets create value at the right price?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","We think it is the right strategy. We think everything is available for us to consider. It will be a full range from our investment activity to the bolt-on acquisitions that you've seen us do here in the Lower 48 unconventional in the last two years, to larger-scale acquisitions where fundamentally it keeps on going back to that test. It has to compete with the investment opportunities that we have in our portfolio. And if the view is that we can capture additional strategic value, and overall our assessment is that we'll capture longer-term accretive performance, then it really sets up the stage for something that we'd be interested in. And remember, we keep that financial capability so that we are agile to respond to opportunities that come along.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. Thank you very much, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jeff, two questions, if I may, one a quick one, just a clarification on the quarter. Maybe I missed it. Did you tell us what is the actual asset sales gain on the P&L in this quarter, and also whether there's any timing benefit value from the price realization for your downstream?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","On the first question, Paul, what I said was there really is \u2013 from an earnings impact, there's really nothing for us to share. There's nothing notable across the transactions. Your second question, can you repeat that again?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's part of the first question, is that do you have \u2013 typically when you buy crude, because of the long haul, sometimes when oil price is dropping that you have a price realization benefit on the finalization.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you have that number you can share with us?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, so quarter on quarter it's a negative about $100 million. Sequentially, it's negative about $200 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So sequentially it's about $200 million negative.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","That's correct.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A second question is maybe more strategic. If I look at your portfolio, say broadly divide it into deepwater, oil sands, shale oil, and LNG, when you look at those buckets, can you rank for us that in terms of the attractiveness of future investment within your portfolio on those buckets? In other words, which one is weighing the highest, and which one is the lowest in your portfolio today?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Paul, I'd ask you to think about it a little bit differently; that within each one of those resource types, there is a range of attractiveness in terms of value. We may have some very attractive resources in each one of those categories that would compete very effectively with other high-value resources within another bucket. Quite frankly, what's really important here that I'd ask you to think about is that we have a very diverse and deep resource base that we are able to participate in each one of those resource categories. And within those resource categories, we've got very high-value investment opportunities that will effectively compete for allocation of capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, that's fair. Maybe let me ask from another angle then. Out of the 98 billion barrels of your resource, do you have a rough estimate how much of them based on today's technology and the physical term you would be able to generate more than a 10% return under a $60 Brent?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","On the 92 billion barrel resource base, again, I'd ask you think about it differently because what the organization does is we will continue to optimize our development alternatives to make sure that we maximize the return on these barrels.","So if we identify a resource that we don't think we can get an attractive return on, there will be other means to go ahead and either implement a different development scheme that will reduce the economic risk and improve the return, or ultimately we may choose to go ahead and monetize the asset. So it's a dynamic portfolio that is really working towards getting the greatest value from every barrel. And then of course, we complement that with our application of technology. I'd just use the unconventionals as a good example about how technology has really increased the value of the unconventional resources. Another good example is in oil sands, how technology is being applied to really improve the profitability and allow us to capture greater value from those resources.","So I think it really speaks to the strengths of ExxonMobil. We have the knowhow. We've got the excellence in how we go ahead and do our development planning, how we identify value-added real-time technology to enhance our investment choices, and then of course, leveraging our ability to interface with the resource owners to find the right fiscal environment to go ahead and progress the investments.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.","Operator","Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company has our next question.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Morning, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","So on the last call there was a little bit of inquiry about growth opportunities post this round of guidance in 2018. It strikes me that sort of U.S. gas is a really big component of your resource base without pulling much weight in income today, and perhaps there's an opportunity for that slug of resource to provide some of that outer year growth. I was wondering if you could just maybe walk us through your broader views on gas, specifically any kind of path you see for that tranche of production to start contributing a little bit more to the overall income profile.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure. Let's start, Sam, with our energy outlook. If you think about the energy outlook, gas is growing about 1.6% per year. From an LNG perspective, from where we are, say, 2010 to 2040, we expect LNG demand to triple from current capacity. So that really sets up, if you will, the investment case. And then globally, we're very well positioned with gas assets around the globe to participate not only in the domestic market but in the LNG market.","So maybe if I can focus now on just the U.S. for a moment, we have had a constructive view that gas is going to continue to grow in the U.S. as gas replaces coal for power generation. Our gas resource base is also significantly underpinning our investment in our petrochemicals. So our expansion, for instance, at the Baytown refinery to add ethylene lines, 1.5 million tons per annum, as well as a concurrent investment at Mont Belvieu to add polyethylene lines, in fact, metallocene polyethylene, will be underpinned by an advantaged feedstock that is U.S. natural gas.","And then furthermore, it also positions us to provide a source for LNG export into the global market. By way of example, we're progressing through a regulatory review of the Golden Pass LNG export facility. Think of it as a brownfield development because all the original investment associated with the export facility is going to be advantaging that site as we move forward into an export facility.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, so that brings me to my follow-up, I guess. How much of your investment evaluation process is geared around integrating some of the resources that you have in place? So for example, as you see U.S. gas here get pressured in the near term from improved economics from unconventional producers, would that ever lead you to accelerate your investment in things like ethylene crackers or even U.S. LNG facilities to promote your own position?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I think it's a good question, Sam. Think about it this way; that we will time the investment in gas resource development activities to underpin value chain opportunities that we're pursuing. That is expansion into petrochemicals. That would be the LNG export. We will time those resource development activities to underpin the value chain investments that we're pursuing.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect, thank you very much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Sam.","Operator","We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Jeff, hey. Good morning. Question for you, a lot of your peers have been recognizing impairments and restructuring charges I guess partially as a function of head count reductions and OpEx reductions, and then secondly resetting internal price decks. I was wondering if you could remind me. Is there a certain timeline that Exxon uses to reset the internal deck that they're using? And then secondly, with some of these operating cost reductions that you're seeing, is part of that head count related, in which case we may see some restructuring charges?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","We don't have any plans, Blake, to have any restructuring charges. As I said in the prepared comments, we have really focused on right-sizing the organization through our history. Particularly, if you reference the merger of Exxon and Mobil to where we are today, we're down over 30% in terms of total employees. So we are constantly right-sizing that organization and identifying additional opportunities to improve the productivity of the organization as a whole. So we don't anticipate any restructuring charges.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. And it doesn't sound like there's a timeline on internal price forecasts or anything like that, like some companies use the third quarter or something like that.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I'll go back to talking about our \u2013 what really informs us is our outlook on supply and demand.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Okay, the second question for you, very briefly, a lot of companies are starting to see lower decline rates as a function of increased reliability or some of the longer plateau projects coming online. This may be a better question for the Analyst Day, but I didn't know if you're witnessing the same thing in your portfolio.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Generally speaking, if you look at our 10-K, we have continued to update our, if you will, average decline rate over the long term, which is still about 3%. That does not include uplift due to major new project developments. But we have continued to invest in some very long-life assets that have really very long plateau production rates, like Kearl, like the LNG investments we've made in Papua New Guinea and in Qatar. That gives a very strong foundation to our production, but importantly, a valuable foundation that contributes significant cash flow.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks a lot, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet, Blake.","Operator","We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi. My question is going back somewhat to the industry cost-cutting and CapEx cutting that you're seeing, and it seems like some other companies are cutting a lot more aggressively than yourselves given the state that some of those companies' balance sheets are in. I was just wondering. On the back of that, when would you expect that to have some kind of an impact on your non-operated production, given that we might see higher decline rates coming through with the lower number of infill wells being drilled, less tie-backs being put into place as projects get canceled?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Anish, that's a hard one to answer in terms of what others are going to do that results in volume impacts on our non-operated. Recognize that a large part of our portfolio is driven by long-life investments. These are multi-decade investments that are generating volumes over the long term. Granted there is a material component that's much more shorter-cycle investments, and we have seen some of the assets where we are not the operator, the activity drop off significantly because of weaker balance sheets. Of course, that may present an opportunity for us.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay, thank you. My second question was on your U.S. gas production. It seems like it's been fairly weak this quarter. It's down around 9% year over year. I think you had some benefit with Hadrian coming onstream. I'm just wondering in terms of that trend and that decline rate. Can you just give some kind of outlook of how you see your U.S. gas production progressing, especially in the current oil and gas price environment, and how you expect the gas price environment to evolve? What does that mean for your U.S. gas production? Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","A large part \u2013 I will remind you that a large part of our gas is coming from our unconventional resources. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. We have not been investing in drilling activity here very significantly, primarily given the outlook for near-term gas demand. And as I said earlier, we're going to pace the investment program consistent with expected demand growth for conversion from coal to natural gas in power gen, the investment in petrochemicals, the regulatory approvals needed in order to export that gas and compete in the LNG market. Unfortunately, given certain regulatory restrictions in the U.S., that does slow down the investment opportunities, and I think it really points to the opportunity the U.S. has to more actively participate in the global market.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","That's great. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet.","Operator","Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I can do one higher-level one first. If we think about project sanctions and your investment in long-cycle projects right now, where do you think you are in the deferral or reinvestment process? Have you seen costs come down to a level at this point on long-cycle projects where you feel like it's time to reaccelerate investment? Have you not deferred much in your view at this point? Or probably I guess what have you seen on FIDs? What FIDs could you expect going forward, or do you think that costs need to come down further for you to get reengaged?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Ryan, I guess I would tell you that we haven't disengaged. We've maintained an active investment program. In addition to the 32 major upstream projects that I've talked about and then the financial \u2013 FID decisions that we've taken on some of our downstream and chemical projects, we've given you some line of sight on the next tranche of upstream investment opportunities that are currently in various stages of either development planning or even in the early stages of pre-engineering, if you will. It gives you a sense for what we're working on.","I want to remind you that we are capturing real-time benefits through capital efficiency in our investment program. Those are structural improvements that we're capturing. Yes, there are market improvements that we're experiencing as well. But as we make the investment decisions, we test those investments across a very wide range of prices, including commodity prices, and that's well within the current price environment. So the investments are very robust, resilient to a number of factors that can significantly influence them, and that positions us very well to continue a continuous investment program, not get the inefficiencies of the stop and the starts, obviously underpinned by our financial capability, and allows us to further capture economic uplift in the current market climate.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, that's helpful, and then maybe if I could ask one more specific one. On the last quarter you provided a little bit more granular production levels on some of your onshore assets, where they were in the quarter in the Permian, the Bakken, the Woodford. Would you be willing to say what those assets produced in the third quarter and maybe what your Midland Basin acreage is up to at this point?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","So the Midland Basin acreage, as I said in the prepared comments, we're up to 135,000 net acres.","In terms of production or total gross operated production from the Permian, Bakken, and Woodford is just shy of 250,000 barrels a day. Bakken is leading that at over 100,000 barrels a day. Permian is approaching 100,000 barrels a day, and the rest is in the Woodford.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. It's getting to the top of the hour, so I'll leave my contentious one for the second question. First one, you mentioned you picked up extra acreage in Nigeria. Any signs that Nigeria is moving forward in terms of changing terms to get those attractive reservoirs actually development-flowing?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I think there's a clear recognition that there are some opportunities to stimulate further investment, technology application within the country. And I think there's an earnest effort to try to put in place the right investment climate. There is significant opportunity in Nigeria. And as we said in the prepared comments, we're encouraged by the exploration results that we've had. But we're just going to have to wait and see where it moves. There are a lot of issues that they're dealing with and we've got to be patient, but we've got make sure that we weigh in. But in short, I'd tell you that we're encouraged by the new government and where they're heading.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And this is a small but potentially contentious issue. Just I saw Asia gas volumes down, and I hear that Petronet in India is rejecting cargoes, or at least low on the take-or-pay commitments. Just maybe talk through, it's probably just a timing issue in terms of how that might affect volumes. But talk through about any issues with Asia gas that we should be aware of, just for modeling.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I guess what you're referring to is on Asia gas that we're down sequentially. That's primarily due to some entitlement impacts associated with some quarterly true-ups as well as some decline in other impacts.","With respect to LNG contracts, they're confidential, as you can appreciate. As I said earlier, all of our contracts are based on a longer time horizon. We've got various elements within the contracts to give us and the buyer some flexibility, but there's really nothing more to share beyond that.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Jeff, I think when we met midyear you were saying there hadn't been a major upstream FID this year. At the same time, I'm seeing that you're consistently losing money in the U.S. C&P. The two, one is obviously long cycle; the other is short cycle. I was wondering in the short cycle case why you seem to be maintaining very high levels of activity when you've got nearly a $0.5 billion loss here and whether or not that's a function of perhaps oil profits being offset by natural gas losses, or if I'm missing something about the breakdown of that loss. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","So let me give you a perspective of the upstream U.S. business. Paul, all of our assets are managed to maximize returns through the lifecycle, which is obviously on a longer time horizon than the current price environment. As you've heard me say before, we really focus on those things that we control, like integrity, reliability, productivity, importantly our development and operating costs, making sure that we've got operational flexibility, and as you've heard the downstream side, the pursuit of higher-value product yields.","I'd say that importantly, we invest in attractive opportunities through the cycle that will further enhance the profitability and capture savings in the soft market. And as I've said before, the current investment program that we have underway in the U.S. portfolio is attractive in this price environment. I'll also...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Based on the assumption that oil prices are higher in the future?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","No, not at all. So I'll remind you...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Based on the assumptions that efficiency gains will make it profitable in the future?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Based on factual current data that we've got and how we manage the portfolio as well as the existing operations.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I guess what I'm looking at is maybe $0.5 billion dollar loss in U.S. C&P.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Right.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Will that become profitable in due course at these prices?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Again, we manage the business over a longer time horizon. And to be clear, our U.S. upstream portfolio continues to generate positive cash flow.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so it's positive cash. So what's the problem with the earnings then?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Again, Paul, we manage the business over the longer time horizon. And we'll continue to do what we do very well and manage the things that we control, continue to work on the operating costs and the reliability.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, I understand. I'm just slightly digging around just because it's been a fairly consistent loss. And because it's short cycle, I think that's what I'm really driving at. I would have thought that it's a short cycle business, therefore the short-term performance might be better.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","The increase in the loss in the third quarter was primarily driven by another reduction in crude realizations that we all experienced as well as some additional downtime and maintenance.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay, thanks, Jeff. I'll leave it there, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","All right.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you. We're getting pretty long on the call, so I'm just going to keep it to one and hopefully be fairly quick. Jeff, can you confirm that the Iraqi government has asked you to slow investment at the West Qurna project? And can you comment whether you're now at peak capacity in Phase 1 of the project and whether you'll be able to hold that level if you're not investing?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","On the first point, Jason, I really can't talk about discussions between us and the government. Production has remained above about 400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter with continued pressure support, and that has grown over the recent past.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","And do you expect that you'll be able to hold it at that level?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","It will be our intent to maintain production levels. Obviously, that's going to require continued investment and pressure maintenance.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Roger Read with Wells Fargo has our next question.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess maybe following one of the questions earlier from Ed, as you look at other countries where maybe they're becoming a little more reasonable, whether it's your tax structure, royalty structure, PSCs, et cetera, we've seen Canada raise taxes. We've had Nigeria stuck in neutral for a number of years. As you look across the rest of the globe, are there any places where we're seeing some adjustments from a political standpoint that might make things more attractive over the next couple of years?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I think if you look at the globe across the full value chain for the energy sector, I would point to the progress being made in a number of places. One place is Mexico. Mexico has made significant progress opening up the door to investment. You think about some opportunities in West Africa that have opened up, East Africa.","Now of course, when you open up a new area, there are a lot of other issues we've got to deal with because there's limited infrastructure, perhaps not a well established fiscal basis, so it does take more time. But nonetheless, I would tell you from an encouraging foreign investment that there's been some pretty good progress out there that's increased the amount of opportunities that we've got before us.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up to that, you mentioned earlier in the M&A discussion that it had to compete with your internal opportunities. As you look at maybe a changing dynamic internationally and your exploration spending because I think of that as having to compete with the M&A side given the uncertainties and the longer timeframe, how is exploration spending keeping up with the overall spending reductions adjusted for efficiencies and all that? Is it going to remain a similar percentage of total CapEx? Does it need to decline in this environment? Just curious which direction you're going to go there.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Think about it as being more opportunity-driven. It's a function of the opportunities, the maturity of our resource assessments, and the appropriate timing to make the investment within our obligations to the resource owner.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No percentages?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Nothing to quantify, it's a very large and extensive resource base that we're pursuing. But I will again remind you that it's solely focused on how it can high-grade our existing portfolio. So after we've done the assessments and we have a better handle on what the prospect potential is, it's got to be able to compete before we'd be spending more money there.","Roger D.

Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, two quick ones. How's Kearl going?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Well, thanks for asking, John. Kearl is moving along very nicely. As you heard, we got the Kearl expansion started up ahead of schedule. All the learnings have been fully integrated into the expansion project. It's ramping up quicker than initial development. And through the quarter, we produced in excess of 180,000 barrels a day gross. And I'll tell you that we have produced over the 220,000 barrels a day design.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, great. Next one and last one for me is you're seeing a lot of your IOC brethren reduce their risk profiles. I think other people were getting at this. Are you at all worried in terms of your global portfolio or the world as a global portfolio of having fewer potential partners for these large-scale projects going forward, or is this an advantage because you execute well?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","I think a couple thoughts there. One is is that clearly we're in the risk management business. There's a lot of risks that we deal with, one of them being the geopolitical risks, another one being the economic risks associated with many multiyear investment programs on these big multibillion dollar investments. I wouldn't say that we're seeing a back-off on interest by our typical partners in these type of investments. I would say that there's clearly a desire for us to continue to be in a leadership role in a lot of these big investments. We think we've demonstrated our credibility, and I think that plays well not only with the resource owner but with the industry as a whole.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great.

Thanks for fitting me in here.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","You bet, Guy.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","I wanted to talk a little bit about North America unconventional. But you've highlighted efficiency gains this year have been significant and the benefits from technology improvement. You obviously have a broad perspective across various plays in the Bakken, Woodford, Permian, and your gas plays. So could you just talk a little bit about which specific play you see the greatest potential for continued efficiency gains and technology application? Really just trying to get some differentiated thoughts by play in the U.S. in terms of what the current view might be and maybe how that's evolved over the last year or so.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","It's a really good question, Guy, in particularly the way you ended your question because it has truly evolved over the last several years. Our prominent acreage holdings are in the Bakken, Permian, and the Woodford. I would tell you that we're very, very excited about all those opportunities. Clearly, the Bakken is more advanced in terms of its development, although I would also say that we continue to capture additional cost and productivity improvements in the Bakken. The Permian has got multiple reservoir objectives, and I think that presents a unique opportunity to further optimize the value, probably more so than the Bakken. And the Woodford is very early stages, and it's really hard to compare and contrast at this point. But in summary, rather than saying one is better than the other, I'd tell you that they're all very exciting. They're all a very important part of our portfolio and have significant value uplift potential for us in the future.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great, Jeff, and then last one for me. The international downstream business performance was very impressive obviously, but you earned more this quarter than all of last year combined. Can you talk about the fundamental margin outlook going forward for refining, particularly internationally? We've been surprised by the strength of that market this year. And maybe the same for chemicals, just given those businesses have done such a tremendous job this year of offsetting the weakness in oil prices, so it's important.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Well, as you know, broadly speaking, refining margins are really a function of product demand and available refining capacity, not only new capacity adds but also rationalization of capacity in regions that have excess capacity. We do not provide a forward look on margins. But I would say that particularly in the non-U.S., you've seen really good strength in Europe, Asia very similar to the U.S., driven by Mogas. I think the results really underscore the strength of our integrated portfolio.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for the comments, Jeff.","Jeffrey J.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth slowed in the second quarter, primarily due to continued weakness in European Union. The U.S. and Japanese economies are also expected to show declines from first quarter levels. China growth, while still robust, continues to weaken than prior year levels.","Energy markets were mixed in the second quarter, with lower crude oil and natural gas prices while industry refining margins increased from the first quarter. Although U.S. chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia commodity margins continued at near bottom-of-cycle conditions.","Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. Exxon Mobil's second quarter 2012 earnings were $15.9 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion from the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter earnings included a net impact of $7.5 billion associated with divestments and one-time tax related item.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $3.41, up a $1.23 from a year ago. The corporation distributed $7.7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, of that total $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares.","Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the third quarter of 2012. CapEx in the second quarter was $9.3 billion, down 9% from the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to the absence of acquisitions made in the second quarter of last year.","Our cash generation remained strong with $13.9 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the second quarter 2012, cash totaled $18 billion and debt was $15.6 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of fund.","Over the quarter, cash decreased from $19.1 billion to $18 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program, yielded $13.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The $9.6 billion in working capital and other primarily reflects eliminations or gains on asset sales, increased working capital and tax items.","Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $8.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased our cash by $1 billion.","Moving on to slide six and the review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings of $15.9 billion, increased $5.2 billion or 49% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to gains from asset sales partly offset by one-time tax item. Upstream earnings decreased to $183 million, while downstream earnings improved by $5.3 billion.","Chemical earnings were up $128 million, and corporate and financing expenses were flat. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million for quarter. As shown on slide seven, Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings increased by $6.5 billion compared with the first quarter of 2012.","Moving next to second quarter business highlights and beginning on slide eight. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites Phase 1 project achieved first oil in May ahead of schedule. The initial phase has a peak production capacity of 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and will cover a total of approximately 250 million barrels from the Mavacola and Clochas fields. The development is located 95 miles of the coast of Angola and water depths of approximately 4,500 feet.","Phase 1 of the project includes 18 wells with subsea tiebacks to the existing Kizomba A&B floating production, storage and offloading vessels, thus optimizing the capabilities of on block facilities to increase current production levels without requiring an additional FPSO vessel.","In Nigeria, we completed the installation of three well head platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellite project. These are the first offshore platform structures to be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start-up in late 2012 with peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day.","We also completed the installation of the Arkutun-Dagi gravity-based structure, offshore Saklan Island in Russia. We are currently progressing pipeline tie in with topside installation scheduled for 2013. The project will have a peak production capacity of 90,000 gross barrels per day and is on schedule to start up in 2014.","Construction is also progressing at the Papua New Guinea LNG project which remains on schedule for 2014 start up. The entire 250 mile offshore pipeline has been installed, and over 105 miles or approximately 60% of the onshore portion of the main gas pipeline have been welded.","At the LNG plant, pipe wrecks and heavy equipment are being installed on the process strength and piling on the jetty is complete. Additionally, mobilization and commissioning of the first two new drill rigs was ongoing during the quarter. The second rig is being mobilized to hide, with drilling expected to begin later this year.","Also during the quarter, two rigs began drilling in Hadrian North in the Gulf of Mexico to further appraise the resource. The results from these wells will be incorporated into the overall development plan.","And finally, the Kearl Initial Development project is now 94% complete. All modules have been transported from the United States and integration of the modules into the plant facilities is progressing. The project is on schedule to start up later this year.","And turning now to Slide 9, we continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft. In June, we signed agreements with Rosneft to jointly develop tight oil reserves in Western Siberia and establish an Arctic Research Center for offshore development. This agreement combines the strengths of our two companies, Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology leadership in tight oil and unconventional resource development and Rosneft\u2019s direct knowledge and experience of Western Siberia\u2019s geology and conventional production.","In the near future, we will develop a work program for selected Rosneft license blocks which will include geological studies and drilling with drilling planned as early as next year. A pilot program will be established to determine the technical feasibility of developing these reserves.","The Arctic Research Center will provide a full range of services to support all stages of our joint venture oil and gas development on the Arctic shelf, including ice monitoring and management, logistics, and the design of ice resistant offshore vessels, structures and Arctic pipelines. Safety standards will be a priority for the center, which will have its own special marine incident warning and prevention center.","In addition, we progress joint exploration activities in the Black Sea where seismic acquisition is now complete. We remain on schedule to commence seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea later this year. Exploration drilling is expected to being in 2014-2015 timeframe, as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted.","Turning now to conventional exploration on slide 10; in the quarter, we achieved continued success in our conventional exploration portfolio. In Tanzania, we drilled a second exploration well with our partner Statoil. As indicated by the operator, this well has confirmed the discovery of approximately 2 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. This follows our first exploration well on the block, which discovered approximately 5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.","We also made a gas discovery on acreage in North Western Papua New Guinea, and have commenced drilling of a second well in the Highlands. This exploration activity is designed to support expansion studies for a third train at our Papua New Guinea LNG project.","Also during the quarter, we drilled our third well in Vietnam which encountered additional gas. Results from this well are being evaluated. In light of the encouraging results in Romania, planning for further exploration activity is underway. We expect to begin acquisition of a new 3D survey on the Neptune license by year end. And finally, we were high bidder on 22 blocks in the recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale.","Moving on to slide 11, we continue to advance our growing portfolio of high potential unconventional assets in liquid rich plays like the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore and the Neuquen Basin in Argentina. In the Bakken, we have moved into a development phase across our roughly 400,000 net acre leasehold. In the first half of 2012, we turned 40 wells to sales, nearly double the pace of 2011. In the second quarter of 2012, our gross operated Bakken production increased by 60% over the prior year quarter. Since our entry into the play, we have more than doubled gross operative production to approximately 32,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.","In the Woodford Shale and the Ardmore Basin, we completed a strategic bolt-on acquisition adding 58,000 acres of leasehold and just over 4,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of production. This brings our total Woodford Ardmore acreage to approximately 260,000 net acres and expands our resource potential beyond the 600 million oil equivalent barrels previously estimated. In the second quarter, we utilized 10 rigs to delineate our acreage, to evaluate optimal well spacing and continue development activity.","Moving to South America, we have drilled two exploration wells in our Argentina's Neuquen Basin. Testing at the first well is underway. The second well is scheduled to be completed and tested in the third quarter. A third exploration well is also planned to spud during the third quarter. Our efforts are currently concentrated on defining the resource potential of our more than 800,000 net acre leasehold.","Turning out to slide 12, on the North American chemical growth project, during the quarter, Exxon Mobil Chemical filed permit applications to progress plans for a world scale, petrochemical expansion that our integrated Baytown, Texas complex. The project includes a new ethane cracker with up to 1.5 million tons per annum on ethylene capacity, which will see two new 650,000 tons per year premium polyethylene lines situated at the nearby Mont Belvieu plastics plant. The proposed expansion capitalizes on the abundant and growing supply of North America natural gas liquids to economically supply the rapidly growing global demand for high performance polyethylene products. These metallocene based premium resins deliver sustainability benefits such as lighter packaging weight, lower energy consumption, and reduced emissions. Required government reviews and approvals are expected to take about a year after which Exxon Mobil will make a final investment decision. If progressed, a 2016 start-up would be anticipated.","Turning now to the Saudi Elastomers project on slide 13, during the quarter, the KEMYA 50-50 joint venture partners Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and Exxon Mobil announced the decision to proceed with construction of the specialty elastomers project at Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. This continues a long history of Exxon Mobil investment in the Kingdom and represents a significant broadening of KEMYA\u2019s product portfolio.","The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 400,000 tons per year of specialty products including synthetic rubber, thermoplastic specialty polymers and carbon black to serve local markets, the Middle East and Asia. Project completion is expected in 2015.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 14, upstream earnings in the second quarter were $8.4 billion, down $183 million from the second quarter of 2011. Realization has decreased earnings by $870 million due primarily to lower crude oil and U.S. natural gas realizations, which declined by more than $8 per barrel and $2 per thousand cubic feet respectively.","Production mix and volume effects negatively impacted earnings by $330 million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, base decline and divestments, partly offset by the ramp-up of Nigeria and Angola projects. All other items are nearly gains from asset divestments and lower exploration expense, partly offset by one-time tax items and higher production operating expenses increased earnings by $1 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the second quarter of 2012 were $22.12.","Moving to Slide 15, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 5.6% from the second quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, decline and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola and less downtime. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was essentially flat.","Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting it on Slide 16. Upstream earnings increased by $556 million versus the first quarter of 2012. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations negatively impacted earnings by more than $700 million, as crude oil realizations decreased by more than $10 per barrel and average gas realizations decreased by $0.60 per thousand cubic feet.","Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million due to a decline and seasonal gas demand in Europe, base decline and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola. Other items, including gains from asset divestments, lower exploration expense and favorable Forex, partly offset by one-time tax items, increased earnings by $1.8 billion.","Moving now to Slide 17, oil equivalent volumes were down 8.8% from the first quarter of 2012 resulting from a decrease in seasonal gas demand in Europe, base declined on lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 7.6%.","Year-to-date, oil equivalent volumes decreased 5.5% compared to the first six months of 2011. First half 2012 volumes associated with the 3% full-year decline outlook, provided at the Analyst Meeting in March are shown on Slide 18. Operational performance was slightly ahead of plan, benefitting from the early startup of the Nigeria Usan and Angola Satellites projects and strong base performance.","First half 2012 prices most notably in February through April were higher than our March Analyst Meeting outlook basis of $111, and negatively affected first half volumes due to both permanent and price related entitlements. In the second half of 2012, successful startup of several projects and continued strong base performance will support our 2012 volumes.","Moving now to the downstream, financial, and operating results and starting on slide 19.","Downstream earnings in the second quarter were $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from the second quarter of 2011. The driver for the increase was a $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan restructuring, which was completed on June 1. This gain was partly offset by unfavorable Forex effects, one-time tax items, and increased maintenance activities. Improved refining margins, mainly in the U.S. and Europe increased earnings by $650 million.","Moving to slide 20. sequentially, second quarter downstream earnings increased by $5.1 billion, primarily due to the Japan restructuring and improved refining margins partly offset by Forex effects, increased refinery maintenance and one-time tax items and the absence of first quarter gain on asset sales.","Turning now to the chemical, financial, and operating results starting on slide 21. second quarter chemical earnings were $1.4 billion, up $130 million versus the second quarter of 2011. Margins decreased earnings by 150 million, as lower commodity margins were only partly offset by improved specialty margins. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $100 million mainly reflecting weaker demand in Europe.","Other factors increased earnings by $380 million, which includes $630 million associated with the Japan restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable Forex effects.","Moving to slide 22. sequentially, second quarter chemical earnings increased by $750 million mainly associated with the Japan restructuring.","Stronger margins increased earnings by $160 million, primarily due to lower feedstock costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70 million mainly due to weaker demand in Europe.","And finally moving to Slide 23. Exxon Mobil's second quarter financial and operating performance reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results.","As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI.","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Doug. How are you?","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","I\u2019m doing fine. My question is on foreign exchange, FX, asset sales, and tax items and specifically whether or not you have functional and geographical quantification on those items in Q2, I mean there was a pretty large lump in the quarter, and I just wanted to see if we could get little color and segmentation?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, let me \u2013 why don\u2019t I start with the items in the $7.5 million.","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Okay.","David Rosenthal","$7.5 billion, I\u2019m sorry. The primary item in there was $6.5 billion associated with the Japan restructuring.","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Right.","David Rosenthal","Okay. And the segmentation of that $6.5 billion was $5.3 billion in Japan, I mean in the Downstream, $600 million in Chemical, $400 million in corp and fin, and about $100 million in the Upstream. And the balance of the $7.5 billion really related to gains on asset sales in the Upstream primarily Angola Block 31 and a number of tax related items.","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Okay. And also in A&P business there was commentary that several of the major integrated gas projects in Australia faced cost overruns that is the most budget contingencies were appropriate at the time. So I wanted to get your insight in the trends and investment performance versus budget in Australia, because Exxon has been in the country for many years and given that you have significant holdings besides the integrated gas you obviously hold a unique perspective. So any trends that you could highlight or provide insight into would be appreciated.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, I'll make a general comment, and then for specific project updates I\u2019d recommended that you [to talk] with the operator of any specific project. But in general over the last couple of years, we have seen some foreign exchange issues with the Australian dollar as well as across the board there have been some cost pressures on labor; and I think those have been well documented in the industry. That's all part of normal project management for us, and you have to find ways to offset those, I think the important things on some of these large projects in addition to cost management is to ensure that the project stays on schedule and comes up on time, and that generally is the focus. But again, if you had a specific project in mind, I\u2019d recommend you ask the operator for any specific update.","Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Sure, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Hey, good morning David.","David S. Rosenthal","","Good morning, Ed.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Just two quick questions, first the buyback. I mean obviously, you\u2019re still maintaining a $5 billion; you did get some good sources and uses of cash from acquisitions. And [dragging] in Europe is making comments which is helping the oil price. But if we do see a slowdown, how do you think about the rate of buybacks being appropriate, and if the earnings starting to support the buybacks, do you see enough disposals in the pipeline to compensate?","David S. Rosenthal","","Ed, I really won\u2019t want to comment or provide any guidance on forward expectations with regard to allocation of funds. Other than to say, there is no change in our ongoing view of that, and as you know our first priority just find all of our attractive investment opportunities, after that is to pay a growing dividend and you recall we did raise the dividend 21% earlier this year. And then after that, it\u2019s the share buyback to maintain our capital structure and return excess cash to shareholder. So no change in our approach and we\u2019ll see as the year goes along to how the cash flows turn out given the conditions in the market, but no change in our approach.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks. And then just a specific one on the operations. Asia gas volumes were being pretty steady for a number of quarters until the second quarter of 2012, was that maintenance or was that a PSC effect in terms of a tranche kicking in somewhere.","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, let me provide a little more clarity on that, because your question also gets to the main factor if you look at our volume breaks and you look at the entitlement effects that you saw there. And really the impact you\u2019re seeing in Qatar, and I want you know that that unlike the RasGas and Qatargas, LNG trains, the AKG projects, which as you know supports domestic gas sale, does operate under a development and production sharing agreement.","And during the quarter that project became cost current and that did impact both the volumes that you see in the region that we noted, as well as the entitlement volumes that we talked about. As far as performance, performance is expected in the region and all the countries there and the assets that we operate. And again the real impact is AKG becoming cost current.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","And it\u2019s fair to think about domestic prices being lower than the other project, so that would have a lesser impacts on cash flow than the headline production?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, that would be a correct assumption.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks, very much David.","David S. Rosenthal","All right; thank you, Ed.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Hi, Doug. How are you today?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Not too bad, thank you. I wanted to go back to one of the events during the quarter which was I guess your official exit from Poland. And I just wanted to get your updated prognosis on shale gas in Europe generally and (inaudible) that\u2019s one of the biggest producers obviously in Northwest Europe. What are your implications for you gravitating back to work exports of LNG in the well 48? And I have another follow-up please.","David S. Rosenthal","Those are two distinctly different questions. When we look at Poland, we did drill and complete and test two wells, one in each of the two basins that we were in there. And we did not have any demonstrated, sustained commercial hydrocarbon flow from either of those two wells. and so we have decided to end our exploration activities in Poland at this time.","Now as you look across Europe, there are a number of other opportunities and a number of other countries, the people are looking at including ourselves. And so I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions in any one country or across Europe, it\u2019s early days. We have set off and as you look around the world that all the unconventional resource opportunities, they\u2019re all different; they\u2019re all in the early stages of evaluation. And it\u2019s going to take some time to figure that up.","Now I will mention, because we haven\u2019t talked about it in a little while, our holdings in Germany. and as you know, we have a very large acreage position in Germany and we continue to want to actively explore that. as you know, we've had some permitting issues there over the last year or so that has held that program up.","I can\u2019t tell you that the expert dialog group that has been studying this issue for a while has reported their findings unlike many other similar studies and findings across the world, including the U.S., this group do not see any fundamental, environmental, or other risk aspects that would argue against the exploration and production of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs.","So with that study out, we are in the process now of working on getting our \u2013 working with the regulators particularly in the local areas and the community at large to progress our exploration plants and get the permits necessary to progress. So again, I think every country is different, every unconventional resource opportunity is different and it would be tough to make any geographic conclusions at this time.","Now if we switch over to the potential for LNG exports out of North America, we are continuing to study those options both in the U.S. and in Canada, as you know, we have vast unconventional holdings in both of those locations. We have a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility; we do have some assets in the ground already to import LNG. So we are continuing to study all that and look at our options and the economics and more on that as time goes on.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, David. I guess I was thinking that, I look probably European gas would impact your gas decision as well I hope that was one question. If I could try a second is a very quick follow-up on, there is some second half of this question, you didn\u2019t give the FX or the tax impacts by division, if you could that would be really helpful? I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me first give you the foreign exchange impacts, if you are looking at the second quarter of \u201912 versus the second quarter of \u201911, we had about a negative $200 million delta on Forex in the downstream and then another two\u2026","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I apologize for interrupting, could you give us the absolute as opposed to the deltas is that possible?","David S. Rosenthal","I don\u2019t actually have the absolute number, Ed, I have \u2013 Doug, I\u2019m sorry, the deltas again I think if you are just looking at (inaudible) it\u2019s $200 million negative in downstream and 200 in chemical, but I don\u2019t have the absolutes.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks very much.","David S. Rosenthal","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I will now go to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","How are you doing? A question on Kara, I know you mentioned the project start-up in the back half of the year. How should we expect volumes in 3Q and 4Q and what\u2019s the volumetric plant there in the start-up and then somewhat related, I guess, I believe that the 50% goes to Exxon refineries and then 50% into the market? I guess we should assume that (inaudible) refineries first, and is there any feedstock change, being used system as a result of that?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, sure. Let me hit the status of the project. first, it\u2019s progressing very well, as I mentioned, we\u2019re 94% complete, and I got the modules in place and that we\u2019re in the U.S. and we\u2019re progressing towards a late start-up. That start-up is probably a December start-up. Our intention is to ramp up to 110,000 barrels per day of production from that. but to give you a quarterly number or a specific timing would be real difficult, because again, if you\u2019re not going to start up till December, it won\u2019t have a huge impact.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And what\u2019s the expected maybe trajectory to either kind of gross, 110 gross?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah. We\u2019ll be ramping that up, obviously from the time we\u2019d start up into the next year. I don\u2019t have a specific ramp up profile, other than to say as safely as possible and with the operations running, we\u2019ll ramp up to that 110 as quickly as possible. But I don\u2019t have a specific timeline for you right now.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. But from the feedstock?","David S. Rosenthal","I'm sorry\u2026","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","On the feedstock\u2026","David S. Rosenthal","The first thing I\u2019d say is, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we have a 50\/50 mix of what\u2019s going to our refineries versus what\u2019s going to go into the market, the other part of your comment is correct, we will optimize in general to displace the placement of those barrels, but certainly having the flexibility of our own refineries in Canada as well in the Midwest, we\u2019ll be able to optimize those first, and then put the balance in the barrels. But that will change depending on the market, which is you know has been fairly volatile recently. And so if I gave you a split today that may or may not be the split six months ago, but you\u2019re certainly spot on with your comment about us optimizing first into our refineries, and then the balance going into the market so that we can maximize the value of all the barrels really across the whole refining circuit.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and if I may just \u2013 thank you. If I may just one other question.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the update of on the PNG LNG project and it sounds like you are really moving along well there. I mean, can you remind us of how much gas excluding, I guess these recent discoveries is behind that development, and whether \u2013 are further discoveries necessary for potential expansion opportunities there?","David S. Rosenthal","If you look at, first if you look at the trains, those are to 6.6 trains will start-up in 2014, and as I recall the total resource back in that is up about 9 Tcf.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So you need additional discoveries likely to expand right?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, and that's what I said, earlier that two things are going on, we are certainly studying the opportunity for a third train, and the positive news is we\u2019re having exploration success this year in drilling some wells and we have an active exploration program ongoing with a lot of additional acreage that we have available to us. So it\u2019s a positive story with the steel we got going in the ground now; it\u2019s a positive story on the exploration front. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on getting what we have up and running while steadying for further expansion and optimization.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question.","David S. Rosenthal","","Thank you for the questions.","Operator","We will now go to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, Dave. Good morning.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Paul. How are you?","Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Very good. Two quick questions. You\u2019ve been quite active in building in Gulf of Mexico and had good success, are you now, all set with all your rig requirements for the next say one or two years or is that you will meet additional requirement there?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, if you look at what we\u2019re doing now in the Gulf of Mexico, probably the biggest thing we got going right now, is the two wells that we\u2019re drilling simultaneously at Hager & North as we continue to look at that resource. As we go on through the year, we are looking at the possibility of another well in the Gulf before year-end. But we\u2019re now talking about a specific rig line or what\u2019s contracting, and what\u2019s not, what I could tell you is we do have flexibility around the rig fleet. We are planning for a sustained exploration program. And when we look at the opportunities and the rig availabilities and the assets that we have under contracts, I think we\u2019re well positioned to progress the program, I don\u2019t see any constraints or any holds up in terms of equipment availability.","Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Dave, if your current rig, the contract expand into let\u2019s say 2013 and 2014 or that is expanding this year?","David S. Rosenthal","Paul, I really wouldn\u2019t want to comment specifically on rigs and lease arrangements and that sort of thing, those are all part of commercial nature of the business, and so really wouldn't want to get into any specifics on that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","\t","Okay, sure. The second question that \u2013 you have to \u2013 I have to apologize, yeah, probably due to my ignorance. Given the low natural gas price over the last 12 months in the U.S., if the natural gas price stay at say $2 to $3 dollar per Mcf range, is there a circumstance that would force you guys that to look at your open reserve booking from the XTO and also that any way down for separately how is the accounting from that standpoint?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, Paul if we step back just a little bit obviously that is a very large resource that we acquired in the XTO acquisition. Some of it is book to prove reserves, bought a whole lot of it is really in the resource base. And so, when you look at prices and the volatility of those prices, and what's going on, I don't think when you look at our outlook going forward that we see ourselves really getting into the issues that you're talking about without getting into any specifics on accounting, and reserve reporting. I'm confident that if you look at that resource and what we've got book now in the conservative nature, with which we tend to book proved reserves, I\u2019m not expecting there to be any issues in that area.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, should we assume that the ceiling test you would be allowed to use your own internal long-term price deck?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, if you look at that ceiling test as far as I know, you do use your own long-term expectation for those prices.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","David S. Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","I will now go to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","David, good morning. I have a couple of questions for you on two different projects. one is back to the Gulf of Mexico and Julia, I know there are some issues with the government a while back and as I understand, you\u2019ve worked that out and you\u2019ve now retained the block. Can you just give us an update on, if I recall, it seemed to be fairly large discovery, any update on timing and activity out there?","David S. Rosenthal","","Sure. I\u2019ll be happy to give you an update on that. as you know, we did drill that first exploration well in 2007, it was successful. we did have some issues with the Department of Interior around that license. I can confirm that the comment that you made, yes, those issues have been resolved. And in fact, if I look across the second quarter, we are working on the development plans for that. in fact, we are really progressing in the technical validation program at this time and front-end engineering and development. and late in the quarter, we did place some initial long lead equipment items.","So if you look at the whole broader schedule, we are progressing as rapidly as appropriate. but again, we\u2019re already in the process of ordering long lead programs, working on the development plan and the evacuation plan. So that project is progressing.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay, great, thank you. And then the other one was actually on the Tanzania, it sounds like you\u2019ve got about 7 TCF discovered to-date. I\u2019m wondering for one, how much need in order to justify development? and secondly, my understanding is that government will not approve multiple development. So it\u2019s almost a bit of a race to see who is going to have the first move or advantage, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any update on your activity there?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah. Let me hit the first question on the results in Tanzania, that has been today a very successful exploration effort for us. We have said that the first well looks like we got about 5 Tcf of developable reserves there, and then the second well looks like we got about 2; so, for a total of 7 Tcf. I can tell you we are continuing with our exploration activities, we got some additional seismic going on this year, and may even put another well before the end of year. So that's all going very well.","I would want to give a specific number in terms of what's required for an LNG project, because it could have multiple aspects to developing that. and so I wouldn\u2019t want to give specific number there. In terms of the race to get a project underway, I\u2019m not aware of any constraints on that program. It is still early days in that whole area of East Africa as you know. There has been a tremendous amount of activity and some successful discoveries, but to start discussing order of projects and who gets there first and that sort of thing, I think it probably will be premature to talk about that.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And then I\u2019ll go to Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you, David. Good morning.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Faisel. How are you?","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Good, how are you doing there?","David S. Rosenthal","I\u2019m fine.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s going on with U.S. natural gas production. it looks like it peaked at about 4 Bcf a day in the fourth quarter of last year and it\u2019s been coming down steadily. I was wondering if that\u2019s the function of your shift in rig count in the lower 48.","David S. Rosenthal","It's a number of factors. You have to start at the top of that with base decline, across the conventional resources and decline that we\u2019re seeing there. If that\u2019s going to be partly offset by the increases in unconventional gas production. But as you pointed out, we have seen a shift and that shift continues in our rig count, to the liquids-rich plays. So the program itself is, as I described before, we are managing across the entire portfolio, which does include continuing to delineate, appraise, and evaluate the dry gas areas, while at the same time, focusing the drilling on the liquids-rich plays. And the other thing that we\u2019ve had in there, we have had some divestments, you might recall we had one in the Gulf of Mexico a year or so ago and that would decline \u2013 would have an impact there. So, it\u2019s really a combination of decline, divestments, some shifting of rigs and then offset by the production increase that we\u2019ve seen in the unconventional resources at XTO.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And I believe at the Analyst Meeting, you guys talked about how you were running maybe just under 70 rigs, I am not sure if it\u2019s still the right number or not. but it seemed like you had shifted to 50% of those rigs were now drilling in liquids-rich plays. Can you give us an update on where you are with that sort of mix in rig count?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, sure. We have continued to both reduce the absolute number of rigs running. I think we averaged about 57 across the quarter. We\u2019re currently in about 51 rigs in total, and without giving a specific percentage, I can tell you the majority of those rigs are working on liquids and liquid-rich plays and that obviously would be a continuation of the trend that you are seeing over the last few quarters.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks David. And last question from me. On Slide 16, where you talked about the first quarter to second quarter sort of progression of earnings for Upstream. The $1.76 billion sort of other, and you said, part of that was Angola and part of that was favorable FX. Was the FX sort of movement, was that a absolute number or was there a big change quarter-to-quarter because of something in the first quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","","No, again it was kind of small, it was less than a $100 million and that would be the change quarter-on-quarter. So within that bar, it's not a big effect either way.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.","","David S. Rosenthal","All right, thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll now go to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Thanks very much. Two related question about Rosneft, if I can. First one is as you know Rosneft has public said, they are talking to BP about the potential TNK acquisition. If that happens how do you see that changing your relationship with them. And second question on the same point, has Exxon contemplated buying the TNK-BP stake?","David S. Rosenthal","","Actually my answer would be the same to both of those questions. I really couldn't provide any comment on either what others in the industry are doing or anything that we might have gone on and are thinking about.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","I appreciate it.","","David S. Rosenthal","All right, thank you.","","Operator","","I will now go to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yes, hi David. Unconventional liquids was about 5% or 6% of the U.S. oil production or liquids production. How big do you want to make that on a going forward basis? I mean, how large a ramp should we anticipate?","David S. Rosenthal","","That's a question I really couldn't answer because I have no idea what the forward projections are going to look like. Obviously there's a lot of activity, a lot of plays, we are certainly heavily involved both as I mentioned in the ramp-up of our existing fields like we have at the Bakken, but also in the pursuit and capture of a number of attractive acreage holdings like we mentioned in the Woodford Ardmore and the Utica.","So from an Exxon Mobil perspective, I can tell you as we move out of these delineation appraisal and valuation of programs into full development, you'll continue to see the ramp-up that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly in places like the Bakken and then in some of the other areas. But we don't have a target and I couldn't give you a target for the industry. It's really just going to depend on how quickly these new opportunities that us and others are finding. You can get in and get those online and then of course you need the midstream infrastructure to evacuate those volumes and get them to market and to the extent that you're producing NGLs, there is other midstream infrastructure that has to be put into process.","So, there's a lot of opportunity, a lot of nice ramp-up kind of across the board as you mentioned. But it would certainly be hard for me to give any indication of what kind of ultimate target might be either for us or the industry in general.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Thanks I was only asking about Exxon. But thanks David.","David S. Rosenthal","Okay, all right.","Operator","And then I\u2019ll go to Ian Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, David. Good morning.","David S. Rosenthal","Hey Iain. How are you doing?","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I\u2019m doing very well actually. And couple questions, firstly and thinking about your U.S. onshore operations at the moment. Have you got an updated number for either capital employed in U.S. onshore or return on capital employed, which you\u2019re generating at the moment?","David S. Rosenthal","No, we don\u2019t typically give that level of detail, Ian. So, I wouldn\u2019t have either of the capital employed number or the return on that.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, all right. Second question is about dividends. Obviously you\u2019ve made a pretty substantial increase in your dividend payments. I just wonder when you are thinking about that and how do you factor in potential changes in dividend taxes, withholding taxes in the U.S., is that something you think about or is this kind of more fundamental change or increase you\u2019ve made?","David S. Rosenthal","A number of factors as you would guess go into the whole decision-making process about the allocation of cash and that sort of thing. Though, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on any one specific factor or even to speculate ultimately what the tax situation might look like or changes that we might see in the upcoming several months. So, again a number of factors we think about, we don\u2019t try to speculate a whole lot about the future from the standpoint that you mentioned, so I really wouldn\u2019t have a specific comment on that.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","So, was there something investors were kind of pressing you to look at rather than as a kind of add-on to the existing share buyback, was that part of the rational?","David S. Rosenthal","We spend a lot of time talking to our investors about a number of things; dividends are one, share buybacks are another. Not all of the investors are interested or have a waiting to any one particular disposition over another, some have one preference and others have another. We do spend some time looking at the competitiveness of both our total distributions and the breakout of those and we do look at that. But in particular on a specific input or a specific factor in the analysis, I wouldn\u2019t give any waiting to one over the other. We do spend time taking all the factors into consideration and of course that includes input we get directly from our shareholders.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. Last question please on Vietnam; I believe you proved up quite a substantial amount of gas now that with these three wells following on from, last year\u2019s discovery. And any numbers you want to share with us about what sort of level of reserves you proved up, you gave us obviously something on Tanzania and maybe you can also talk about the forward program on that?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, I can tell you. We are not as far along in assessing what we have in Vietnam as we were in Tanzania. We\u2019re still evaluating the wells there. We had one well that was not successful and two that were, and so we\u2019re still in the early days. So looking at that we got a lot of work to do, lot of evaluation to do and to assess that we are looking at additional seismic and other expiration activity. But little early to start giving you resource numbers at this time.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","All right, David. Thanks for that.","David S. Rosenthal","Thanks so much.","Operator","Now we will go to Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Hi, Paul. How are you doing?","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Fine, thank you. Apologies, I\u2019m traveling today, so I got on the call late. But I did want to ask you about your specials and the way you declare them. I guess the question is, I completely don't understand what \u2013 why you depend those specials, in the table of specials, but then immediately say, there were lot of specialists?","David S. Rosenthal","","Paul, let's talk just a minute about in term of specials, and I think, I can address your question. Really, you have to think about two different considerations when you're talking about special items. The first that I'd offer you is, if look at this from an Exxon Mobil perspective both asset divestments, and acquisitions that become a normal part of our ongoing operations. We talked at the Analyst Meeting in March about the level of divestments that we've had. If I just look across the last four or five years, I think we've had $26 billion in proceeds and about $11 billion in earnings.","So, this is an ongoing piece of the business for us. Some quarters the numbers are a little larger than others, but in terms of divestments being special they are part of the business. I think the other thing to consider is that the use of the term special items has in fact evolved over time, driven in part by updated SEC guidance on the use of non-GAAP terms. And we are certainly in compliance with that updated guidance and paying attention to it, and it has evolved over the last few years. So, if you take those two factors into consideration, I think, you know what we've reported here this quarter is consistent with both of those.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","So is that SEC definition a question materiality then or and I think the other \u2013 find very odd, David, is that you continue to publish this table of zeros, which just kind of seems inefficient quite frankly, but can you just talk a bit more about what you are saying about the SEC. I understand your argument that the divestments are an ongoing part of your business and therefore shouldn't be considered special. I think that\u2019s [fine] the SEC bit.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, without getting into the weeds here, I can tell you that is not really a materiality look. It\u2019s really around the desire for the SEC for company to not describe a charge or gain as the non-recurring infrequent or unusual event unless it meets certain criteria, and that includes a look back as well as a look forward. So, if you're looking back and you've been doing this stuff in the past, and you look forward, and you think that you might have these type of events in the future, the SEC guidance as to not call those non-recurring infrequent unusual special or whatever term, you want to use, and again that has happened over time.","In terms of the table and efficiency, I'll tell you it's possible. I\u2019m not saying that we'll never report a special items, because we may, I\u2019m just saying that when we look at the guidance in our business, none of the earnings impact that you saw in the quarter qualified to be the \u2018special items'.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","If I could just follow-up on Paul Cheng, and is kind of related. I think you were saying that would very, very unlikely be a write down related to XTO, because I guess what you're implying a very conservative in booking what is essentially a very, very large resource.","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, I think it's a couple of things, Paul, it's the conservative nature for which we book things to proved reserves, and it's also our outlook for natural gas prices. If you look broadly and look at our energy outlook, we don't have an outlook over the long-term, the prices are going to remain at current levels, and that's consistent with our investment plans, it's consistent with our energy outlook and it's really consistent with the long-term way that we're going about developing these resources.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, David thanks. I think, I understand, I just wondering, is the SEC going back to that allows you to use your own long-term planning assumption for nat gas prices as regard to booking?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, that's correct.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s good. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning, David. Just one quick question on the lower 48 activity, it looks like you made pretty good progress in reducing the rig count there and moving towards liquids-rich plays, but if we look back sort of a year ago, you were at 70 rigs and natural gas prices were at $4. and then certainly they\u2019ve made quite a recovery off the lows, we saw earlier this quarter and whether that\u2019s sustainable or not, it\u2019s certainly a question, but is the $4 level to think about that Exxon will maybe potentially return to gas drilling or given the low base of rigs, you are working off now, there certainly have to be different conditions where you would revisit some of these gas plays that you\u2019ve moved away from over the past six months?","David S. Rosenthal","I think the answer to the question, and what you\u2019re seeing us doing is really more reflective of our longer-term approach to this. We are still drilling in dry gas areas. We do continue to drill wells in order to work on our delineation, and our evaluation of those plays to make sure that again over the long-term, we want to be in a position to maximize the recovery and maximize the value generation from those resources, so that hasn't changed. What you have seen that we've talked about is both a reduction in the total rig count, and some of that of course is in response to the short-term pricing that\u2019s happened. In addition, the move of \u2013 a lot of the rigs over liquids and liquids-rich is really both to start to delineate and appraise and think about developing our new acreage like the Woodford Ardmore, again as well as wrapping up in the Bakken.","In fact, I think I heard the other day we're up about 10 rigs in the Bakken, out of those 51. We really don\u2019t have a price trigger to any big extent. You might do something a little different at the margin in any given quarter depending on prices. but when you really look at the overall plan and the overall strategy, it continues to be with a very long-term view of this, very large, very high quality source we got.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. In the short-term though, do you expect that 51 rigs total you\u2019re currently running? Is that enough to do everything you want to do as far as evaluating those plays and driving production on liquid-rich plays or would we expect during short-term to see that rig count continue to fall?","David S. Rosenthal","I really don't have an outlook going forward for the rig count. We continue to progress the program, and we could see some variability around the number that I mentioned, but I really couldn\u2019t give you an outlook in terms of either direction or rig count specifically.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thank you very much.","David S. Rosenthal","Bye, thank you very much.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rosenthal, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David S. Rosenthal","No I\u2019d just like to thank everybody on the call today and thank you for your questions and we look forward to visiting you again next quarter. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"8539":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call April 27, 2018  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Analysts","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Doug Terreson - Evercore","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Rob West - Redburn","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead sir.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Consistent with our recent Analyst Meeting, you'll note additional detail in our press release and this morning's prepared comments. Our objective is to provide clarity on key business drivers in the quarter and describe progress being made to deliver on value growth potential outlined in the Analyst Meeting.","In the interest of time, I\u2019ll move through the prepared material efficiently to ensure there is sufficient time for your questions. While we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Please also see the supplemental information included in today's presentation.","Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our first quarter performance. Exxon Mobil earned $4.7 billion in the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion, the highest since 2014. Importantly, cash flow exceeded net investments in the business, distributions and other financing activities by almost $3 billion.","In the United States, we achieved positive Upstream earnings of about $430 million. In Papua New Guinea, facility shut in resulting from the earthquake reduced this quarter's earnings by about $80 million in volumes by 25,000 oil current barrels per day. We've since resumed production and expect to reach full capacity in early May. As I\u2019ll discuss shortly, we made good progress during the quarter in a number of areas that will support our value growth potential.","Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of financial results. As indicated, the Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings were $4.7 billion or $1.09 per share up 16% from the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion including $1.4 billion in proceeds from asset sales that I'll discuss shortly.","In the quarter, Corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Our CapEx was $4.9 billion up 17% from the prior year quarter resulting increased activity in the Permian consistent with our growth plans. Debt was down to $40.6 billion at the end of the quarter and cash increased to $4.1 billion.","Next slide provides a high-level look at the key drivers for these business results. Upstream, we benefited from higher realizations for both liquids and natural gas. However, our liquid realizations rose less in the benchmark prices due to widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount.","These higher prices resulted in lower volume entitlements. Production was also reduced by downtime in the quarter and divestment of assets. We\u2019re continuing to progress growth initiatives as outlined in our Analyst Meeting including increased drilling in the Permian, advancing attractive new projects and completing maintenance activities, enhance performance over existing assets.","Finally, we're actively strengthening our portfolio to the acquisition of new assets such as exploration acreage offshore Brazil. We also captured incremental value through divestments of assets.","Refining margins remain strong in the Downstream especially in North America. However, joint product demand was seasonally lower. U.S. manufacturing reliability recovered from the fourth quarter and notably Joliet returned to full capacity in March.","We also continue to make progress in growing our chemical business. Integration of the Jurong","Aromatics plant into our existing Singapore business is progressing as planned. In North America sales are increasing with the ramp-up of the new polyethylene lines at Mont","Belvieu supplying the growing demand for petroleum products. Within our base business we successfully completed turnarounds in the Middle East and the U.S. Gulf Coast.","The next slide provides additional detail on sources of cash. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $10 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales.","A positive adjustment for working capital mainly reflects favorable seasonal changes in payables which were partly offset by an inventory build in the Downstream business mostly due to maintenance. Negative adjustment for other balance sheet items reflects timing of equity company distributions.","Asset sales included Upstream properties, notably the Scarborough gas field and Downstream distribution and retail assets. Note that, cash flow was higher than the prior quarter largely due to the higher earnings.","Moving to Slide 7, I\u2019ll describe the uses of cash. Over the quarter, our cash balance increased from $3.2 billion to $4.1 billion. From a cash flow, we made shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and confirmed our commitment to reliably grow the dividend. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.82 per share representing a 6.5% increase from last quarter and marking our 36th consecutive year of per share dividend growth.","Net investments in the business were $3.3 billion lower than the prior quarter due to the absence of acquisition payments. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by about $2.5 billion. This included $1.9 billion in debt repayment and $425 million used to purchase 5 million shares to offset dilution related to benefit plans and programs. In the second quarter of 2018, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs.","Moving to Slide 8 for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings of $4.7 billion increased $918 million from the previous quarter excluding the fourth quarter impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments.","Upstream earnings increased about $980 million primarily due to higher prices. Downstream earnings decreased $12 million driven by weaker refining margins. Chemical business increased earnings by $76 million primarily due to lower operating expenses. These were all partly offset by higher expenses in corporate and financing segment due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher pension expenses.","Our total corporate and financing charges for the quarter were about $800 million. After further evaluation of the full impact of the U.S. tax reform, we expect these expenses to range between $700 million and $900 million per quarter for the remaining of 2018.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 40%, reflecting a higher proportion of non-U.S. Upstream earnings. Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 30% and 40% at current commodity prices and the current portfolio mix. The increase in guidance is driven by Upstream's higher proposition of earnings.","Moving to Slide 9 for a comparison to the prior year quarter. Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings increased $640 million from the year ago quarter driven by higher upstream realizations. This is partly offset by lower downstream earnings resulting from lower asset, management gains, and lower volumes to the higher maintenance in the U.S.","Chemical earnings decreased due to lower margins and corporate and financing charges reduced earnings by another $270 million again due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher expenses.","Moving to Slide 10, we\u2019ll highlight some of the progress we've made over the first quarter that supports our growth plan shared at the Analyst Meeting. We made our 7th discovery on the Stabroek block enabled by our proprietary subsurface imaging technology. Oil well encountered 65 feet of high-quality oilbearing sandstone. Oil will be developed in conjunction with the giant Payara field along with other development phases this will help bring Guyana's total production potential to more than 500,000 barrels per day.","Common activities are on Liza Phase 1 and are progressing well. The Stena Carron is currently drilling Liza 5 appraisal well which will help to delineate the greater Liza resource. A well test is planned at Liza 5 and will begin shortly.","After the completion of the test, the rig will return to the Turbot area to drill a delineation well named Longtail. Previously indicated, we mobilized the second rig to the basin which drove the exploration well Suburban [ph] in advance of the start of development drilling for Liza Phase I.","Suburban well reached total debt this week but failed to encounter commercial quantities for hydrocarbons. We have additional exploration drilling planned later this year as we continue to explore the full potential of the Stabroek block.","In Papua New Guinea, resource assessment certified an 84% increase in the size of the P'nyang field, more than 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. These resources support our discussions with joint-venture partners regarding a three train expansion concept for the PNG LNG facility. One train will be dedicated the gas from P'nyang and two trains will be dictated to gas associated with the Papua LNG project.","This development concept would add approximately 8 million tons per annum doubling capacity over existing plant. As planned, we continue to increase our U.S. tied oil activity. We currently have 27 operated horizontal rigs in the Permian and four operated rigs in the Bakken. We remain focused on maximizing capital efficiency, drilling wells that are consistently longer than the industry average.","Total unconventional production in the Permian and Bakken has increased by 18% versus the first quarter of 2017 with strong well performance supported by optimized completions. With respect to our portfolio, we added 8 new box offshore Brazil which I will talk about shortly and signed agreements for deepwater blocks, offshore Ghana and Namibia.","As indicated, we continue to monetize assets including a 50% interest in the Stabroek gas field. We also closed several downstream divestments including distribution and marketing assets in South America and retail sites in Europe. Further portfolio highgrading remains a priority.","In the chemical segment, we continue to be focused on increasing capacity to meet growing demand for higher value chemical products. We began commissioning our ethylene cracker in Baytown Texas with startup plan midyear. This will enhance integration to lower feedstock costs for the associated polyethylene lines that started up in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 11. First quarter Upstream earnings were $3.5 billion, an increase of about $980 million from the last quarter excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Realizations increased earnings by $640 million, crude prices rose just over $3 per barrel versus last quarter but less than benchmark prices due to the widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount.","Gas realizations increased $0.80 per thousand cubic feet. Volume mix effects decreased earnings by $130 million primary drivers for this with the effect two fewer days in the quarter, higher downtime and lower entitlements partly offset by project growth and seasonal gas demand. All other items increased earnings $470 million largely due to lower operating expenses and positive net asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $10.30 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving to Slide 12, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day a decrease of 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Liquids production decreased 35,000 barrels per day as downtime in Canada, lower entitlements and divestment of our Norway operated assets more than offset growth from new projects and work programs. In particular we were pleased with initial results at Hebron where performance for the new wells have exceeded expectation.","Natural gas production decreased about 400 million cubic feet per day due to lower entitlements and downtime notably in Papua New Guinea. This was partly offset by higher seasonal gas demand and project growth volumes.","Moving to Slide 13 for a comparison to the prior year quarter, first quarter upstream earnings increased $1.2 billion due to higher realizations. Crude prices rose $10.80 per barrel versus the year ago quarter and gas realizations increased $0.90 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $190 million lower entitlements and increase downtime specifically in Papua New Guinea were partly offset by project volume growth. All other items increased earnings $10 million as net gains from asset sales were offset by higher operating expenses.","Moving to Slide 14 oil equivalent production decreased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Liquid production was down 117,000 barrels per day due to field decline in the fourth quarter divestment of our operated assets in Norway and lower entitlements partly offset by new project volumes. Natural gas production decreased 870 million cubic feet per day driven by higher downtime, lower entitlements and a decline in the U.S. This is partly offset by project and work program volumes.","Turning to Slide 15 we\u2019ll provide an update on earthquake recovery efforts in Papua New Guinea. First and foremost on behalf of Exxon Mobil and in particular our staff in Papua New Guinea I want to extent our thoughts and well wishes to the people of PNG as recovery continues falling the devastation brought by this powerful earthquake and its aftershocks. Sponsor and initial earthquake all of our production gathering pipeline and processing facilities were safely shutdown.","Exxon Mobil's humanitarian response to-date is included to distribution of food, water, emergency, shelters and other supplies along with the transportation of medics into affected areas. We focus support of the most impacted remote communities may bring our operations and have also made a donation to relief agencies. Our facilities successfully withstood the magnitude 7.5 earthquake in late February and its aftershocks due in large part a robust design and the immediate and effective response by our people.","As of its location we accounted for a wide range of seismic activity in the original design, engineering and construction of the PNG\/LNG project. In mid-April ahead of our projected recovery timeframe we announced a safe resumption of LNG production the second LNG train started up this week and the facility is wrapping up to full capacity. LNG exports have also resumed.","During the period that production was shutdown we also brought forward and completed maintenance store facilities that was planned for later this year enabling more efficient operations in the months ahead. We proud of the response of our people in managing this extreme event and importantly churn for the community.","On Slide 16 we take a closer look at ExxonMobil's current acreage position offshore Brazil which positions us with significant high quality resource potential. You\u2019ll recall that last year we captured several attractive opportunities including a combined farm and bid round award for the discovered undeveloped Carcara field which extends across both the BM-S-8 and North Carcara blocks. Carcara field contains an estimated recoverable resource of more than 2 billion barrels for which the co-venture group is progressing development planning activities.","Groups near-term plans include up to three wells in the field better delineate the resource and deploying the development concept. As we shared at the analyst meeting this proposed development yields attractive returns even at crude prices of $40 per barrel. At bid round 15 held last month we were awarded an additional eight deepwater blocks containing multibillion barrel prospects in the pre-salt play taking our total acreage to more than 2 million acres across 24 blocks.","ExxonMobil operates more than 60% of these acreage holdings and we will leverage our capabilities and proprietary technologies maximize potential resource value. We will be acquiring more than 19,000 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data in 2018. As we already have 3-D seismic of some of the blocks we\u2019re also progressing plans for the first exploration well scheduled for the latter part of next year.","Moving to Slide 17 we\u2019ll now discuss downstream financial and operating results. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $940 million a decrease of 12 million from the previous quarter excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Global refining margins decreased earnings by $200 million unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $40 million mainly due to lower seasonal demand and higher maintenance activity partly offset by improved operations in the U.S. All other items increased earnings by $230 million mainly driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of last quarter's Norway retail divestment.","Moving now to Slide 18 downstream earnings decreased to 176 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Margins were down 30 million due to lower non-U.S. margins partly offset by higher margins in the U.S. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million due to continued higher U.S. maintenance activity mostly at Joliet which resumed full capacity in March. All other items reduced earnings by $90 million mainly due to do the absence of asset management gains from last year's Canadian port credit asset sales.","Moving now to chemical financial and operating results on Slide 19, first quarter chemical earnings were about more than $1 billion up 76 million versus the previous quarter excluding fourth quarter 2017 impacts from newest tax reform. Weaker margins and lower volumes primarily due to turnaround activity negatively impacted earnings by $30 million each. Lower operating expenses and favorable impacts from foreign exchange increased earnings by $140 million.","Turning to Slide 20 first quarter chemical earnings were down $160 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins resulted in a decrease in earnings of 270 million as increase feedstock costs outpaced stronger realizations. Higher product sales from our new chemical operations in Singapore and the U.S. improved earnings by $120 million","All other items in the quarter included higher expenses related to new operations and other growth opportunities which were mostly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. These growth opportunities are key the component of our plans detailed at the Analyst Meeting.","Now turning to our final slide, corporations focused on growing value across our integrated businesses. Each of our businesses contributed to solid financial performance in the quarter together earning $4.7 billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of 10 billion covered our net investments and dividends with free cash flow of $6.7 billion.","Upstream production volumes were 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day in line with our expectations. We expect second quarter volumes to be lower due to seasonal gas demand and then growth in the second half with project entitlement volumes, seasonal demand and volume benefits from accelerated maintenance completed in the first quarter.","Total CapEx was $4.9 billion with no change to your guidance. Strengthened, the Upstream portfolio to exploration, acreage capture and selected divestments as well as disciplined execution for our investment program.","In the Downstream we are progressing our advantage investments such as those in Rotterdam and Antwerp manufacture higher value products capitalizing our proprietary technology and integration. And in the chemical business we\u2019re focused on growing sales of our differentiated products supported by new assets that are well-positioned to meet global demand growth. Finally, we remain committed to our shareholders as demonstrated by 36 consecutive years of dividend increases.","That concludes my prepared remarks, before we turn to your questions I\u2019d like to note that in the remaining quarters of this year one of our management members will participate in the call to provide further perspective on progress and key developments relative to our plans. Chairman and CEO will participate in the fourth quarter.","With that I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin","I guess just to start on the overall profitability spectrum. At the Analyst Day you offered a pretty clear view that the Upstream contributions would be you know after the post-2020 long cycle development program is wrapping up and in the interim Downstream and Chemicals would carry a lot of earnings growth. I understand the slides clarified that the margin environment wasn't necessarily supportive of that in 1Q, but maybe just an update on how those two segments are performing in an apples to apples margin picture and sort of what the fundamental outlook looks like for the remainder of the year and into that 2020 period where Upstream starts to contribute more?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes Sam good question, and thanks for taking us back to what are our plans as we detailed in the analyst meeting. As you may recall let me take each of them separately in the Downstream, we are making - we have been making very strategic investments in order to high-grade our products.","I highlighted in my prepared comments Antwerp and Rotterdam which is going to take us out of lower value products into higher value products. We\u2019ll have Antwerp that will start up in the middle of the year and then Rotterdam will start up by the end of the year okay.","As well in the Downstream, we have continued to expand our entry into some high growth areas such as Mexico and Indonesia everything is moving consistent with the plans that we laid out in the analyst meeting.","On the Chemical side, same story we had laid out for you a plan of growth commensurate with what we saw in terms of chemical products. Importantly, as I indicated in the prepared comments that the Baytown cracker will be starting up middle of this year it is the really the second half of the overall project remember the first half being the two polyethylene lines in Mont Belvieu which have started up and have been wrapping up to full capacity and that will add a significant additional comp on it to our chemical portfolio.","You also recall there are a number of other investments that we made in chemicals in Singapore importantly but we are making great progress on integration of our Jurong Aromatics acquisition. But we see significant value there and as the organization continues to integrate that into our big Singapore manufacturing facilities we continue to see additional opportunity but right now the focus on Singapore and Jurong Aromatics primarily the integration and capturing the synergies that we saw.","I leave it there unless you have more questions on it.","Sam Margolin","No that\u2019s all right I assume they\u2019ll be more later in the Q&A. My follow-up is on Upstream. I wonder if we could dig in a little bit on these entitlement effects, specifically they were a little bit accelerated from 4Q even though the oil price move was actually somewhat more substantial in 4Q versus 1Q. I know there is a lot of nuances in these contracts and some of them are subject to some nondisclosures and confidentiality. But anything we could glean on the forward look for these entitlements and maybe some future impacts maybe decelerating here considering the quarter-over-quarter increase in that piece of the production number?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, I mean you\u2019re highlighting an important issue that has historically been a key criteria on how our overall volumes play out. I mean if you go back and look at just sequential analysis versus last quarter it was over 90,000 barrels a day that impacted us. And as you appropriately recognize each of these contracts that we have that have entitlement volumes are very unique. They are really a function of the commercial structure, the expenditure level and obviously prices.","Now the good news side just don't lose sight of the fact that if you have an acid that is not cause current that just means accelerated recovery sooner. But it's hard for us to convey specific guidance given the unique aspects of - each of these contracts.","But if you just think about what you\u2019ve seen sequentially 90,000 barrels a day and you think about it quarter on quarter which I believe is around 70,000 barrels a day. It can have a material impact, but remember what our fundamental objective here is to really manage the business to maximize the value proposition.","And that\u2019s what most important here and as I said on the volumes going forward you can really think about our volumes contributions in 2018 coming from the areas that I mentioned you know our project growth notably in places like Hebron, Odoptu and Upper Zakum the title oil growth that we\u2019ve been advertising, but we\u2019re making great progress. We said that we\u2019d be there at about 30 rigs by the end of this year. We\u2019re already at 27 rigs so we\u2019re really ahead of schedule.","The second piece that you got to remember is that, as I alluded to there has been a number of unplanned downtime events in the first quarter and we went ahead and took advantage to accelerate scheduled downtime that we have in the latter part of this year into that first quarter to be more efficient and the downtime on the facility notably in Papua New Guinea as I reference and the second area in Syncrude.","So we took full advantage of the opportunity to optimize the business and we\u2019ll, as a result, have more efficient operations in the second half of the year, won't have those planned events, and therefore, we will get some volume recovery.","The third thing that you'll recall is, as I mentioned is in the second half of the year, we'll start seeing that seasonal demand start ticking-up on this again. And then, lastly, I'll mention and I didn't say in my prepared comments, but we always have a very robust conventional work program and we're -- those are fairly cheap high value barrels that we're able to capture through the propane.","Operator","We will go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Todd","And I would like to pass along things not just for the incremental disclosure, but I think the addition of management team members to the call to be welcomed going forward by investors, so that's great.","And the first one from me would maybe on Groningen and again one of your partners wrote off reserves and booked an impairment of Groningen associated with the recent government announcement there. Can you speak to your thoughts here going forward, as well as maybe help frame what the potential impact would be or -- and whether you view there being a possibility of any compensation going forward?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Well, I mean, as you can appreciate, it is a very dynamic situation. We continue in discussions with NAM, the operator and the government. Those are confidential discussions. Really Ryan at this stage we just don't want to speculate until we conclude those discussions. But we're still operating, the field is still operating under the current cap of 21.6 billion cubic meters per year.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And maybe a follow-up on Canada, I know you brought forward some of the turnaround there at Syncrude. But can you talk about your availability to get Canadian heavy out of there, I mean, how are you seeing when Syncrude comes back, are you anticipating limits on your ability to get it out, is it -- are you moving things on, how much on rail versus pipe and how much you're able to run through your refineries to capture the benefit there?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. You have really covered some of the answer there. In the first quarter we did experience some constraints due to logistics. It was about 12,000 barrels a day in the quarter itself. If you think about going forward, right now we're able to clear all the barrels.","Importantly, if you think back in the prior discussions, one of the objectives that we've continued to press within our business is maintain logistic flexibility. Several years ago we went ahead and tested by way of example in Edmonton Rail Terminal that gives us another export option. Obviously, we've got pipeline capacity that we can leverage. And then, importantly, as you point out is that, we're also trying to capture the full value chain benefits by bringing the heavy oil into our own equity pass beyond on refining.","But we will -- we continue to find them the best value option for us in order to deliver those barrels to market. So it's all about making sure that we're looking well ahead of the issue and identifying how do we maximize that flexibility, either take it into our equity, capacity in our manufacturing footprint or to export it to capture a greater value.","Operator","We will go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Again, Jeff, thanks for the incremental disclosure, but I think there is still some confusion out there on what's really going on in the operating cash flow. So I wonder if I could trouble you to just walk through the dynamics of the net PP&E odds, what is the timing of affiliate distributions and reconcile that with net income plus DD&A, which is $9.2 billion. You see what I mean there is the CapEx of the affiliate level, as I understand, is reported on a net basis above the operating line, if you could confirm that and just walk through the delta, because I think folks think that your cash flow number was closer to $8.2 billion.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So our -- if you look at our net PP&E it was $3.3 billion and that reflects -- that's absent the cash requirements for affiliates, okay.","Doug Leggate","Right.","Jeff Woodbury","And that is down versus both the prior quarter, fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the prior year quarter, primarily due to the absence of acquisition funding.","Doug Leggate","Just on that point did you pay for Brazil in the first quarter?","Jeff Woodbury","In the first quarter -- what\u2019s specific Brazil, there has been a number of transactions?","Doug Leggate","The Carcara acquisition, that was the money outdoor in the first quarter for Carcara?","Jeff Woodbury","Not yet","Doug Leggate","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","That is to come later this year.","Doug Leggate","All right. But your net capital spend after affiliates are the -- below the operating cash flow line was $3.3 billion, is that number we should be looking at.","Jeff Woodbury","That's correct.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Great. Thank. My follow-up is, obviously, you said in your commentary about the Sorubim-1 successful well. When we met with you a couple weeks ago my cousins had made a comment that in a success case there could be a third rig option because of the potentially open another play type. Has that option now gone away, is that play type now abandoned or does just condemned that upside exploration case or maybe you could just frame how these changes the rest profile of the block and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Sure. I mean, let me just characterize, I mean, Sorubim, like any exploration program there is a fair degree of risk in all these exploration prospects. As I've indicated previously, every time we drill one of these well, we pick up some additional insight of learning\u2019s and I wouldn\u2019t say that the well in itself would condemn the play or the prospect opportunities that we've got in Stabroek Block.","As it relates to the potential of the third rig, Doug, I would tell you that that is always a possibility, but we will make that decision based on the technical maturity of our prospects as we integrate the real time data that we get things from Sorubim, from Liza-5, and other analysis that we're doing based on that 3D seismic that we went hit and took.","Right now we've got, the plan is to go ahead and run the two rigs in parallel. One primarily focusing on the development wells for Liza Phase 1 following the completion of the Liza Phase --Liza-5 well test and in the second we will be following up on some prior discoveries and again we will think about how we modify that rig line based on how we mature the technical prospects.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Phil.","Phil Gresh","First question is actually a little bit of follow-up to Doug\u2019s question, you noted the equity affiliates headwind in the quarter of a $1 billion. Certainly appreciate you breaking that out from the working capital. So just wondering how you think about that number for the full year and one of your peers, for example, has said that the affiliates will be a $2 billion headwind on an annual basis, I know it\u2019ll be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, so just any additional color you can provide there.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Well, so, I mean, if you think about the equity companies. I mean, obviously, a big part of the $1 billion that we think about it, I mean, that's typically a seasonal pattern for us, okay. Usually we don't see those distributions until later in the year if that's what you're trying to get your hands around.","Phil Gresh","Yes. That was definitely part of it. It did sound a seasonal on the quarter, but I was wondering on an annualized basis also is it, you kind of lumped together a number of factors\u2026","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah.","Phil Gresh","\u2026 and your disclosures in your filings, I just wonder if that affiliate headwinds on an annual basis which still be headwind.","Jeff Woodbury","We think, I mean, broadly speaking without giving you a specific numbers, Phil, I would tell you that most all the earnings are distributed throughout the year.","Phil Gresh","Okay. So more of the one to one, I guess, is what you're saying?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. I mean\u2026","Phil Gresh","Earnings to cash\u2026","Jeff Woodbury","\u2026 broadly speaking, I mean, it is going to be some timing impacts depending on cash requirements from the equity companies.","Phil Gresh","Yes. Okay. Thanks. Second question would just be one of your peers has also given helpful statistic around base plus shale CapEx. So, I was wondering if there is some kind of framework with underlying your capital spending numbers, you might be able to provide around base plus shale given that for you guys it\u2019s essentially going to drive flat production for the long-term.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. I think from our prior discussions, Phil, what you really were looking at was capital efficiency. And we clearly pay close attention to that versus how we expect we should perform, as well as how our peers are managing this important area.","And our conclusion continues to be that, we lead in that area. Now we don\u2019t think comfort in that only because we think we get always do better. But as you think about how we conclude that it\u2019s through a number of things. One I would say that the ultimate measure of that is our return on capital employed and not only we do lead on return on capital employed, we've laid out a very attractive investment program that shows how we\u2019re going to continue to grow that lead out to 2025.","We also have looked at what some are spending annually and while we have a much bigger production base. Our expenditure levels are comfortable on an absolute basis.","And lastly, I would say, if you look at another measure and to me it's really simple one. Take your total capital employed per barrel crude reserves, in other words the money spent developed the reserves. We have one of the lowest dollars per barrel out there. So, I mean, if the objective is to really try to qualify the capital efficiency of our business that's what I would offer to you.","Operator","We go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Jeff, when do you think you'll be in a position of the company to make it FID decision around PNG, and then the -- any update on Qatar in the latest in terms of both the timeline and progress around negotiation there?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Neil, on the first one regarding the PNG, I mean, as I indicated in my prepared comments, I mean, we have clearly made some really good progress. And if I could just go ahead and recap for the group, we did the Interoil acquisition, significant resource at Elk and Antelope, which is right along the pipeline route from the Highlands to plants, so very clear synergies and opportunities. Total operates those assets and we've been in very close coordination with our existing co-ventures and Total, and as I indicated in prepared comments, I think, we\u2019re aligning on this expansion.","In addition to that, two other things to note, one is that we continue to make significant resource -- additional resource captures with, like I mentioned, P'nyang, earlier this year or last year we went ahead and made good discovery at Muruk, and we have got a well that was spud there later this year and we think there is, it\u2019s very significant, very close to the Hides gas field.","And then the last point I would make is that picked a lot of good exploration high quality acreage in the Highlands, obviously, through the Interoil and then offshore of the LNG plant. So the message in all that is that we have built a very sizable high quality resource potential in the PNG vicinity and that positions us with this expansion, as well as maybe potential opportunities.","In terms of the timing, that is yet to be determined, obviously, there are a lot of different players in this and ultimately the resource owner, the PNG government needs to align with the plants and the timing of that. But I just say that, I think, it is very well-positioned. I think the project in itself has demonstrated outstanding performance and I think the earthquake recovery is just another yet example of quality of the people that we got there and the asset itself.","And then as you go forward, I think, we\u2019re very well-positioned to compete as one of the lowest cost of supply providers of gas in that market. So we've got a full focused effort to make sure that PNG is so executed consistent with its history of the best-in-class performance. The timing when we get closer obviously we\u2019ll go ahead and provide a more specific timeline for you.","On Qatar, broadly speaking we value that partnership that we've got with the Qataris. We view that is yet again another very successful venture where both parties brought some value to the arrangement and you step back many years later and you look Qatar being one of the largest LNG exporters, again very low cost of supply and we\u2019re very proud of the role that we played in that. We participated in 12 of the 14 trains. We brought some very important technology to play like big LNG trains and the big LNG carriers, and we want to continue that relationship.","And you seen us partner with the Qataris in places like Brazil and Cyprus, and we\u2019ll continue to find opportunities where we collectively leverage our mutual experiences and capabilities to go ahead and build our portfolio and ultimately drive that into value for both the Qatar and Exxon Mobil.","Neil Mehta","Jeff, a quick modeling question here, in the Analyst Day deck you provided some cash flow levels at 60\/80 Brent levels. What\u2019s the rule of thumb, every dollar change in the price of Brent was that due to the Exxon Mobil cash flow?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. We have the earnings sensitivity that's in our 10-K and it\u2019s -- for every dollar per barrel it's about $500 million of earnings per barrel -- of cash per barrel.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson","The dividend increase of 7%, while pretty similar to the growth rate and the median during the past 10 years and 20 years it\u2019s pretty significant I think. And on this point when considering the new financial disclosure that Darren is going to be on the call later in the year and it returns targets. There has been lot of positive change at the company this year at least in my opinion. So my question is, what is the company trying to convey from the size of the dividend increase if anything and if there is new underlying message from this change or some of the other changes we seen this year what is it.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Well, Doug thanks for the question. I mean, simply put, remember we keep -- we\u2019re keeping very focused on our core mission and that is to grow shareholder value. I mean there is an intense focus by the corporation on value growth, okay.","And part of if you think about our capital allocation approach fundamentally what we said was one of the first priority is growing shareholder value and distributing that success to our shareholders through our dividend and you\u2019ve seen us s for 36 consecutive years continue to grow that that dividend.","And I think when you look at what the Board's decision was earlier this week, it was really underpinned by the confidence that we've got in our business plan. And we made a decision given a number of factors that coalesce to be much clearer in terms of where we saw that value growth potential. And frankly, Doug, I would tell you, because we believe that the investment community did not have a very good understanding of what our value growth potential was.","Doug Terreson","Yeah.","Jeff Woodbury","And we believe it was important to go ahead and make that much clearer. And I can tell you that every one of the senior leadership that are running these businesses are committed to delivering that value potential.","Now a key aspect of that is making sure that we are being very thoughtful and selective in growing that investment program that is going to generate that accretive value. But ultimately all these steps are around a simple message of value growth and making sure that that is clearly understood by the investment community as to where we\u2019re going and that we think ultimately it's differentiated by our technology, by the integration of our businesses that add additional value that we believe is sustainable.","And I think as we go through this year and into next year, and you see us delivering on those expectations, I think, ultimately, I think, people are going to have much more understanding, better understanding of what the full scope potential this corporation has, notably from the integration of our three world-class businesses.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Well, Jeff, your tone surely underscores your enthusiasm towards the new value proposition, that's a good thing. And then I had another question, what was the earnings impact from the gains on asset sales in the quarter and if you have specificity outside of Scarborough, which I think, you mentioned that will be appreciated to?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. So, if you look at, I\u2019ll give you a couple comparisons to give you perspective. So if you look at the quarter-on-quarter\u2026","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","\u2026 impact from earnings, it was about $180 million and most of that was in the upstream, okay.","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","Sequentially\u2026","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","\u2026 it was a negative impact of about $130 million, sequentially being versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and most of that negative impact was in our downstream business.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. The key aspects just a little bit more Doug\u2026","Doug Terreson","Yeah.","Jeff Woodbury","\u2026 is you mentioned Scarborough.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Yeah.","Jeff Woodbury","And then I mentioned the some marketing and distribution assets in South America and also I mentioned\u2026","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","\u2026 the European assets primarily retail assets, okay.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez","Hey, Jeff. Good morning. I know you ran through some pretty good detail on the downstream, but I wanted to ask you more specifically on the upcoming IMO changes in 2020. There's an awful lot of optimism among your independent refining peers. And I didn't know if Exxon had any view, do you share in the same kind of enthusiasm as far as what that\u2019s going to do to just look demand in some of the heavy oil discounts, so just didn\u2019t know if the company had a view?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Well, its good question and good morning, Blake. So if you think about our investments. They\u2019re all really embedded in our deep understanding in the energy markets that are -- that\u2019s really informed by our energy outlook. I mean that\u2019s why we do it, is to get down into the very deep insights that really guide our business strategy and our investment plans going forward. And this is one of those factors is our policy ultimately will impact the energy system and the products ultimately the society will need.","We've been watching this closely for some time. You have seen that we've made a number of strategic investments notably in places like our European assets with Antwerp and Rotterdam. We are going to Coker and Antwerp. As I said Rotterdam were putting the hydro cracker in that\u2019s going to take us out of the lower value products like marine fuel oil into higher value distillates like ultra low sulfur diesel.","As well as grow to lubricant-based stocks. The -- when you think about IMO 2020 specifically, what we want to be position to do is to offer a suite of options for the marine industry. So we are going to positioned to provide things like low sulfur blends. We\u2019re going to provide also sulfur marine gas oil. We will have LNG capability to provide. But also high sulfur fuels for ships with scrubbers.","So one of the advantages in addition to these investments we\u2019re making in Europe is that we got a fairly comprehensive conflicts of refinery network in the in the U.S. Gulf Coast that will be able to provide these products as well.","So, I think, in short I just say that we are providing a lot of optionality and we think we are very well-positioned to address this change in sulfur specs, as well as a number of other changes on the horizon.","Blake Fernandez","Understood. Second question I can\u2019t believe buyback hasn\u2019t come up yet, but this quarter, if I am kind of rewinding last year, I think, we went through this, first quarter seems to be fairly elevated as far as the requirement to offset dilution. I think you had $425 million. I am trying to confirm that that number should theoretically roll-off here throughout the year. And then I didn\u2019t know if there were triggering pointing, I mean, debt reduced, you\u2019ve get free cash flow, is there anything else you really kind of need to see in order to get the buyback program kind of up and running over and above this dilution?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. So, let me just make sure you understand the number of that I\u2019ve talked about in the first quarter. The $425 million was anti-dilutive purchase associated with our benefit plans and programs. That usually happens in the first quarter of the year, okay.","If you think about the buybacks and I certainly understand the interest around buybacks. I mean, simply put buybacks remain on the table, okay. The first priority is to be true this core mission I talked about previously and that is growing shareholder value. If we have opportunities that will provide accretive value investment opportunities, that's where the dollar will go. We are intensely focused on value growth.","Now we do recognize an important distributing value to our shareholders and we do -- we generally do that as a priority through our cash dividend. And I think we\u2019ve shown our commitment to reliably grow dividend as we\u2019ve already talked about.","And I think, as I said, it really demonstrate the confidence that the corporation has in it is business. But as you think about the buyback, we continue to think about it quarterly and we think about what is the current financial position of the company. I would say it\u2019s very strong.","Second, we look at what our investment and our dividend requirements are, and then we think about the near-term business outlook and the fundamentals, and what we think we need in the near-term in terms of additional cash for our investment program or debt maturity, and all those go into a view on whether we want to go ahead and start buyback shares again in a sustainable way.","I\u2019ll just highlight for everybody, remember that since the merger of Exxon Mobil we have bought back about 40% of the shares outstanding. So it has been a key part of our total distributions and it will continue to be one of the options that we will consider. But, first and foremost, reliably growth the dividend, and then, second, accretively invest in our business and then we\u2019ll think about how to use that extra cash. Does that help Blake.","Blake Fernandez","Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.","Guy Baber","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Baber","I wanted to take Permian midstream and logistics, I mean, strategy here a little bit, especially such an important growth driver for you all. But we have seen differential widening out in the Permian for oil and for gas, and potentially widening out again later this year for some time for oil, as those oil pipes get filled. Can you just help us to understand how your Permian crude is priced, maybe how much exposure you have to Midland pricing, how much you move to higher price markets. And then, maybe just an update on where you stand regarding some of the midstream capital investment opportunities that you've discussed and the strategy to just maximize the value of your product there and then I have a follow-up.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. That\u2019s good, Guy. I am happy you brought this point up. Because remember what -- a very -- the fundamental strategy that we've taking within our business is this value chain perspective. Permian is an outstanding example where we built this, what we believe an advantage position in the Permian, such that we can go ahead and develop the resource leveraging our expertise and things like development planning, extended-reach drilling, completion technology, reservoir management and drive the unit cost down lower than what we believe others will be able to do.","But, importantly, we\u2019ve got to carry that all way to what we think is we\u2019ve got a very advantage footprint -- manufacturing footprint in the Gulf of Mexico and thus the importance of the midstream segment, okay.","And if you think about what we have done is, we have a good line of side on that value chain to make sure that nothing is leaking out of there from a value perspective without making -- us making a decision if that was -- that's good -- that\u2019s a business decision.","That we shouldn\u2019t capture that that value ourselves. And we\u2019ve done things like purchase the Wink terminal which we were looking at the potential to go ahead and expand that. We entered into a joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners or a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, where we combined our pipeline assets to gives us a broader export flexibility.","But it is important that, that when we think about these things from a value chain perspective, it\u2019s all about making sure that you\u2019ve got a long-term view and then you position yourself smartly such that you\u2019re capitalizing on the value proposition. So as we think about our Permian production, we are -- we\u2019ve positioned not only the logistics network but also the supply chain to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value proposition and you think about some of the disconnects or the challenges some we\u2019re having, we\u2019re clearing all of our Permian barrels.","We\u2019ve got ourselves lined up that we\u2019re able to make sure that we can get them into market and have the flexibility either to capture the value uplift or manufacturing footprint or send them somewhere else via export in order to capture that value. So a very important example of how the integration has really provided significant value uplift for the corporation, okay?","Guy Baber","Yeah. Very helpful. And then I had two follow-ups here, one on the CapEx front, understanding it\u2019s early in the year, the CapEx was up year-on-year as you highlighted. It was actually a little bit below our model, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing globally from an inflationary or deflationary perspective, as you\u2019re ramping up activity here in your key areas? And I am sorry if I miss this earlier, but in Guyana, Liza-5, was there anything incrementally share at least the five at this point and maybe how are you thinking about the size of that third FPSO as you integrate those results?","Jeff Woodbury","Okay. Let me start with the last question first. In Liza-5 we\u2019re still early days. We\u2019re still -- the well itself was within our expectations and now we\u2019re moving into the testing program. So, there\u2019s really nothing more to share on it.","We have -- we still are holding a resource, recoverable resource about 3.2 billion barrels, but I\u2019ll remind everybody that that excludes any additional add from Ranger and Pacora at this point, because we still need to do some more delineation drilling in order to update the resource assessment.","All of that is being real time integrated into our development planning for the subsequent phases had to Guyana. First phase under 20,000 barrel a day vessel. Second phase, it looks like we have enough FID, yeah, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be about a 220,000 barrel a day vessel. The third one we\u2019re looking at it based on the data real time. We haven\u2019t landed on anything at this point.","But you can see what we\u2019re trying to do is, we\u2019re trying to get into more of these manufacturing routine like we\u2019ve really benefited from in the past like in Angola, is to really get to the point, where you start designing and you start rolling out these comparable similarly designed facility, such as you maximize the value proposition there, but very exciting the time for Guyana. There\u2019s lot going on as you can appreciate from exploration all the way now to planning for production. So watch that space and we\u2019ll provide updates as we progress.","On your other question around, generally the market and any inflationary pressures. I mean, clearly, there\u2019re going to be certain services or specific geographic areas that there are inflationary pressures. Like there\u2019s a lot going on in the Gulf Coast, in the manufacturing areas, that have put pressure on craft labor.","In Permian, obviously there\u2019s a lot of activity and that\u2019s put some pressure, but it\u2019s always about making sure that you stay ahead of all that and that you\u2019re positioning the business, such that it can offset any type of pressure, and in fact, maintain the focus on structural reductions in our business, and that really, frankly, starts all the way back to how you design these projects.","But if you think about the Permian by way of example, we\u2019re continue to drive unit cost down through our drilling efficiencies, it\u2019s all about capital efficiency, so then as you develop or produce these assets to the life that you\u2019re doing it at the lowest cost. But there are areas that we continue to focus on. We are proactive in terms of our contract reward -- awards.","We really look at the total cost of ownership to identify supplier cost reduction opportunities. We leverage bidding. We have a very robust supplier relationship management program. We've got the ability because of the financial possibility the corporation to accelerate and bundle equipment purchases.","So, it's all about make insure that we drop the cost down which has historically been able to offset that inflationary pressure. Now, you may have some in certain places that we're also working through but by and large it's -- what is the lowest lifecycle cost of our assets. That\u2019s good Guy","Guy Baber","Yeah. That's perfect. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng ","Jeff, just I think on behalf of the investor that the -- I will appreciate that Darren and the other management team will be coming to the call later in the year. So I think that's a quick step in the right direction.","Well, anyway, two quick question. First, I think, you have drill a number of well that is 12,000 to 15,000 feet lateral in both Bakken and Delaware several months ago. So, I presume that they have been producing for at least couple of months by now. Is there any production data that you can share, what you have seen in terms of testing the limit there?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Well, Paul, let me give you update where we are on those. First, just remind everybody, we try to give a view of what we saw the value was by extending the lateral lengths in these wells in the Analyst Meeting. You can always go back and refer to that. We have drill the number of these 15,000 foot wells in the Bakken that are still early that they are producing. I would tell you that the results are meeting our expectations in terms of what we would expect in terms of the uplift. ","We have also drilled some in the Permian. They have not yet being completed at this stage. You remember a lot of these wells have been drilled by pads, so in order to optimize, again focused on capital efficiency they're going to coming in batches.","We're being careful. I am going to be very candid with you. We\u2019re being very careful what information we disclose on this, because we do think that there is a competitive adventure here. And but I will tell you that we see the value uplift that we had portrait in the Analyst Meeting.","Paul Cheng ","Second quarter then, given the takeaway capacity in Western Canada, doesn't seems now you are going to resolved anytime soon. And look that, that portfolio within -- those opportunity within your portfolio also seems they have come down in terms of the packing order or ranking. So, how should we look at the incremental oil sands development project at this point from you guys? I think up and until the last year, even May last year that you guys were suppose to go ahead with a number of repetitive project, including the Aspen and the other one. So those deal is being on track to be developed or that there was just being say put back into the paper now?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Good question, Paul. What I tell you is, as you know, we've been working oil sands for over three decades both in the mining and in-situ perspective. Fundamentally any new investment is going to compete at the top of our investment portfolio. It\u2019s got to generate as we talk previously generate an attractive return that's accretive to our financial performance and has durable in a lower price environment.","We continue to identify opportunities to enhanced profitability in both in-situ and in our mining operations. Imperial just talk about what we're doing in Pacora in terms of improving reliability. The same has been true in the in-situ operations, by and large not only optimizing the steam operations, but trying to leverage the fairly deep technology work that we've been doing in our research facility.","And looking how we can best apply the proprietary as I said deep potential that we think we'll not only improve recovery but also reduce costs, and importantly, the environmental impact. So I tell you that portfolio and as you probably aware it is a clearly sizable amount of resource that we\u2019ve got up there, it\u2019s getting a lot of focus around applying the right technologies and capabilities in order to ensure that it competes at the portfolio.","So I wouldn\u2019t say that it has fallen down on a rank. It\u2019s just like every other resource we\u2019ve got, we are working on it and if we come to a point at some stage that we think that the value preposition is meets our objectives than we\u2019ll move forward with it. Is that good Paul.","Paul Cheng","Yeah. One just follow-up on that, will you anyway that go ahead to sanction the project without clear sight takeaway capacity in Canada is being resolved?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s very similar to whole Permian discussion I had, Paul, I mean, we have been thinking about making sure that, one, we have got the takeaway capacity, and two, that we\u2019ve got the flexibility to run these crudes in our equity refining capacity. So it stand ahead of that and making sure that we\u2019ve got that flexibility available and that was -- frankly that was one of the or the key justification of why we invested in the Edmonton Rail Terminal.","But, obviously, we -- our big supporters are making sure that there is investment and infrastructure, and that has been more challenged in certain areas. But we will continue to look forward to make sure that we are working the value chain in order to maximize that value preposition. ","Paul Cheng","Got it. Thank you. ","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you, Paul. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Woodbury","Hello Roger. ","Roger Read","Sorry about that, I had to kick the mute off. Can you hear me now?","Jeff Woodbury","I can. ","Roger Read","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Hey\u2026","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning.","Roger Read","If I could follow-up a little bit on Guy\u2019s question on the Permian. I mean, I totally get it, this is not a -- not anything but a plan program of development for you in the midstream. But are you -- if you were to need more pipeline capacity, should we presume that everything would be done within the joint venture with ETP or would you kind of evaluate the other options as you go forward. I am just kind of thinking over the next several years we are going to have these periods of pipeline over capacity, pipeline under capacity relative to production growth and how you\u2019re looking at maybe specific routes out of the Permian for all of it, both the liquids and the gas side?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. No. We would be evaluating all options. We would not restrict ourselves to one avenue. Remember, I know I keep on saying the same thing, but it\u2019s all about, how we are going to maximize the value preposition and we\u2019re looking at all the different midstream options that we can go ahead and consider.","You may recall, I believe sometime last year that we went ahead and announced that we were looking at spinning another $2 billion in the U.S. for infrastructure investments, things like the expansion of the Wink terminal and enhancing our logistics flexibility and optic. So we\u2019re considering a range of options.","Roger Read","Okay. I appreciate that. And then looking at your rig count the lower 48, four in the Bakken, 27 maybe go into 30 in the Permian. Clearly the Permian area is set up for growth. I was curious so as you think about the Bakken with four operated rigs, is that more of a stability or is that actually also in a growth position?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, if you look at the analyst presentation, where we showed the build up from our U.S. tight oil. Roger you\u2019ll see in there that we had segmented that between the Bakken and the Permian and through 2021, 2022, if I remember right, you have got the Bakken actually growing in terms of volumes and then in essence of Plato\u2019s, but of course, we maintain an active drilling program. The biggest build up is coming from our Midland assets, I mean, our Permian assets.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel","Thanks. Hi, Jeff. I realize we are not too far or removed from the analyst meeting, but given the comments that you made about, first of all, the importance of integration on U.S. Gulf Coast, with your Permian operations? And second, all the preparations you are making for IMO. I was wondering if you could address any further progress you have made towards FID the Beaumont light oil expansion and the Singapore resid upgrade project and maybe any critical past items to actually reaching those FIDs?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. No. I appreciate you are asking. If you recall, I think, it was in the analyst presentation on the Permian, we showed that we were looking at significantly increasing our light oil processing capability by about 400,000 barrels a day by 2021 I think it was. And a key aspect to that would be that we\u2019re thinking about as potential expansion of light crude refining capacity in North America, but that is currently still being considered, no final investment decision has been made at this point.","We are -- I tell you we were given a lot of thought to a number of options. Clearly, we want to bring that to closure pretty quick and we would expect to see an FID decision probably sometime next year to get us on track to meet the objectives that we laid out in the analyst presentation. The other, I am sorry, Jason remind me, what was the second one?","Jason Gammel","The Singapore resid upgrade project.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. So, that continues to move forward in Singapore. I mean, remember there is a number of projects that we have got on -- going on in Singapore right now. The resid upgrade is in progress and it should startup here shortly. ","Jason Gammel","Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the PNG...","Jeff Woodbury","Jason, let me clarify.","Jason Gammel","Yeah.","Jeff Woodbury","We are looking at doing FID decision on that here soon. ","Jason Gammel","So that was a way I took it.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah.","Jason Gammel","And then if I could just ask on the PNG, LNG expansion, Jeff. Are you actually actively marketing volumes from the expansion and have you reached the informal agreements with any buyers HOA type of agreements?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. So Jason we have got as you can appreciate with the number of LNG projects that we\u2019re progressing forward. We\u2019ve got a number of efforts in progress to go ahead and market those volumes, not just PNG but others elsewhere. Obviously, the specifics of those are confidential but just rest assured, remember we did the fundamental premise that we laid out at the Analyst Meeting is to really move forward these projects that were on the far left side of the cost to supply curve such that they compete very well to that demand growth that we anticipate over the period -- this period out to 2024 or 2040. So very well-positioned and we are moving a number of those discussions -- commercial discussions forward. Thank you, Jason.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rob West with Redburn.","Rob West","Hello, Jeff. I am interested in making a couple of comments on some aspects of the results and interested in your thoughts on how it looks to you and how you way to think about it. But when I look at the production across the different geographies of the upstream business, there\u2019s a lot of red in my spreadsheet of year-over-year decline and particularly in West Africa where I -- and see from one of your partners the investment levels going into some of those box in Angola that looks like it might continue to be in decline for a while? So I am quite excited by the long-term projects you are doing and the new growth that should be coming through in a few years and quite excited by that that next year when the Permian starts really inflecting. But in the near-term should we be expecting more year-over-year decline in the upstream production volumes and how should we think about that? ","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Let me talk about more generically that, obviously, there are a number of, let me call, leverage that we pull in order to maximize profitable volumes, I mean, a key aspect of what we\u2019re doing is in the base business where we've got -- this is the depletion decision as you are aware. And we've got a very strong focused on how do you improved reliability and enhanced open recovery and you'll see a lot of what we're be investing are very large resources that give us more flexibility to go ahead and apply our technical knowhow and our technology in order to increase recovery. So, there is a part of the organization that's focused on how do you mitigate the decline by enhancing recovery and operational reliability.","Then there is another segment that you got out there that is focused on accretive investment. That's why we've been -- typically that's what we spend a lot of time talking to the investments that we make in these very large resources like Hebron, Sakhalin-1, Upper Zakum and that's all focused on making sure that we bring long-term value to the corporation that is durable with the volatility in commodity price cycles.","Rob West","I am deeply in favorable of the value approach and but in terms in the next few quarters, should we be expecting decline year-over-year and that's okay because the longer loan growth is coming?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Well, I mean, certainly, there is decline every quarter. I mean these -- all these reservoirs are depleting. And as I said, in my comments, for 2018, we expect production to be comparable to 2017, okay. As I indicated, in the second quarter, due to reduced seasonal gas demand, we do expect the second quarter to be lower.","As we turn the corner to the second half of the year, there are number of things that we would expect that will drive our volume upward and that would be the things I mentioned, and the project activity, the tight oil activity move into the higher gas demand period of the year and then our ongoing conventional program. But no change to our communicated guidance, that we would be generally flat with 2017.","Rob West","Okay. Thank you. That's clear. If I can have a follow-up, I was reflecting on the charges coming through the business to hit the corporate line over the quarter. And my question is about effectively the tax write back for every dollar of charge has just going down. You used to get a $0.35 on a $1 back and now it\u2019s $0.21. Just -- has that triggered any cost reduction target, cutting corporate costs, or cutting some of those expenses that a lower tax rate back on?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I mean, I'll tell you, Rob, I mean, being with this company for 35 years, there is always an intense focus on optimizing on our cost. It just not in the\u2026","Rob West","I thought you might say that.","Jeff Woodbury","I am sorry.","Rob West","I thought you might say that so I interrupted you, keep on going.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't require something to trigger that mentality. I mean that need to be part of your DNA. I mean that is an imperative part of a value proposition is finding ways to get more productive and to reduce the cost structure. So, rest assured that that is the focus across all aspects of our business. Thank you, Rob.","Operator","We go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thank you for taking the question. Just one for me, we've seen a lot of headlines about unwinding of your joint ventures with Rosneft due to the U.S. and European sanctions. Can we get an update on the amounts of CapEx that\u2019s you are investing in Russia this year and where that capital is going given the restrictions on where you are able to invest?","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Pavel, let me clarify this aspect to make sure that there is no misunderstanding. As it relates to resources that are covered by the sanctions. First and foremost I want to be clear that we're fully complied with the sanctions, okay. There were a number of joint ventures we attend joint ventures that were involved in -- that would have been covered by the sanctions and as the U.S. codified those sanctions and expanded in 2017 we chose to go ahead and withdraw, which we've initiated that process with our partners, okay.","And we laid out the specifics of -- the specific impacts that in our 10-K. And as you know, specifically, that resulted in a write-down of any expenditures that were associated with those joint ventures.","Now separate from that is that we do have other activities that are not impacted by the sanctions. By way of example, we\u2019ve got a very long-standing relationship, successful operation on the east coast of Russia in Sakhalin-1 and that continues as it was previously it has been very successful in terms of the investment program and the value proposition for both resource owner and the co-venture partners.","There is also some other joint venture relationships that we have throughout the world with Rosneft that we\u2019re pursuing. So I want to make sure it's clear that as it relates to the sanctions we are fully compliant with them but the rest of our business is progressing as intended.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Can you share how much capital you're putting into Russia this share?","Jeff Woodbury","No. We don't have that information to share.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Appreciate it.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you, Pavel.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.","Theepan Jothilingam","Yeah. Hi, Jeff. It\u2019s Theepan here. A couple of questions actually, firstly, just thinking about your disposal program and in the context of higher upstream prices. I was just wondering whether things change in terms of trying to increase that run rate, I saw the first quarter was quite reasonably a bit ahead of that typical $4 billion per annum mark that you've guided to, so any thoughts that would be great.","And then, just coming back to refining, could you perhaps talk a little bit in the context of what margins you are seeing so as we come through Q2 and maybe relate that also to what Exxon is seeing the global oil demand for 2018? Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","Well, Theepan, thanks for your question. On the -- what I call our asset management program or divestments, I think I alluded to you in the prepared comments that we have been very focused on taking full advantage of where we think we can get incremental value on certain assets versus what we see as continued operations. So it's all about making sure that we maximize the value proposition sometimes, we don't ultimately get offers that would do that and we continue to operate those assets.","We\u2019ve been very careful to make sure that we don't know force a divestment because we\u2019ve communicated an expectation around a certain number of assets or certain dollar value that we expect to get from it. But rest assured, I mean, as you saw in the first quarter we had another $1.4 billion of gross proceeds from divestments that we will continue to pursue where we could get incremental value through the divestment program and I think we've indicated a couple times that we would be very aggressive at that. But we\u2019re not going to go ahead and walk away from value if we -- if the markets not going to offer what we think is worth or more than that.","On for the refinery margins, we don't project margins into the future, but I will tell you specifically as we think about demand, we expect demand to be up in the second quarter and third quarter driven by seasonal impacts. And certainly, what we've got to be doing is making sure that we maximize the product value by the offerings that we have, and of course, also maintain the logistics and feedstock flexibility in order to increase the margin that we will get from our downstream business. And, Theepan, did you have a question about oil demand.","Theepan Jothilingam","Yeah. Just wanted to get in that context, how you see\u2026","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah.","Theepan Jothilingam","\u2026 demand year-on-year, clearly you\u2019ve got a very wide footprint globally, so just want to get a sense on that? Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","Yeah. Yeah. So broadly speaking, I mean, I think, recognize that demand has been fairly strong last couple of years. In fact if you put it in the perspective of a 10-year average it\u2019s been in excess of the 10-year average. Round numbers, last year\u2019s demand growth was probably in excess of 1.5 million barrels a day. It's been fairly robust, but as you go into this year and by the way with that demand growth and with the supply, I mean, OPEC objective of get to the kind of five-year average of OECD inventories is within reach, recognizing we still have excess supplies versus where we were at year end 2013, it had something that certainly continue to be mindful of, as well as the significant supply capacity that remains out there in the industry.","Going forward, we see it fairly similar to 2017 in terms of demand and that's very consistent if you go back, all the way back to our energy outlook, we see that demand is grown about, oil demand is grown about seven-tenths a percent between now and 2014 per year. So it is the deep insights that we get from that demand assessment that we do that really allows us to guide our business strategies and our investment plans going forward. Thanks, Theepan.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions.","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I certainly want to thank everybody for their questions. I do want to clarify just one point to make sure my response was appropriate that there is a question about the earnings and cash sensitivity to the price of crude and we have some of this in our 10-K that you can go ahead and reference. But broadly speaking for every barrel of crude price it relates to about $425 million of earnings and about $500 million a cash for the year.","But going forward I want to thank you again for your time and your thoughtful questions. We always appreciate the engagement and the insights that you bring into the discussion, and we're looking forward to continuing that engagement as we go forward.","As you would appreciate we have taken an extra effort in order to engage with investment community at all levels with the corporation and I think that is allowing us as we talked earlier to provide a much clearer articulation of that value proposition that we laid out to the investment community in the analyst meeting. So thank you for your time and your interest and we\u2019ll be in touch in the future.","Operator","This does concludes today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead sir.","Neil Hansen","All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation on the call today and your continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today is Neil Chapman. Neil is a Senior Vice President and Member of the Management Committee with responsibility for the Upstream.","After I review financial and operating performance, Neil will provide his perspectives on the quarter and give updates on the substantial progress, we've made on the major growth projects across the business. Following Neil's remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I'd also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation.","Moving to slide 3. Let me start first by summarizing the solid progress we have made on our major growth plans along with other noteworthy accomplishments. Neil will go into more detail after my remarks, but I wanted to take a few moments to touch on some key highlights.","For the first half of the year, we've made good progress on our growth plans. The fundamentals and long-term demand growth that underpin our investments remain strong. The competitive advantages we've built into our projects make them robust across commodity price cycles including the margin environment we are currently experiencing.","We reached final investment decisions for nine major strategic projects in just the first six months of the year including projects from all three business lines. Offshore exploration success continued with four significant deepwater discoveries; three in Guyana and one in Cyprus and we achieved key milestones in the development of two of our LNG growth projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique.","Liquids production increased significantly from last year with volumes up 144,000 barrels per day or 7% driven by strong growth in the Permian. We remain on schedule with plans to increase production in the Permian to 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024, as we also continue to build-out supporting infrastructure and takeaway capacity.","In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, recent projects startups in North America and Europe are already making a positive contribution to results. These projects are accretive to earnings even in the current margin environment demonstrating the market resiliency we envisioned when making these investments. In particular, the Baytown steam cracker, which started up last year has performed exceptionally well with production exceeding design capacity by 10%.","Lastly, we increased the quarterly dividend by 6% marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Positive momentum we generated in the first half of the year is in line with the plans we laid out in 2018 and reiterated in March and positions us very well to generate long-term shareholder value.","I'll now highlight our second quarter financial performance starting on slide 4. Earnings were $3.1 billion in the quarter or $0.73 per share including a positive $0.12 per share impact from a tax rate change in Alberta, Canada. These results were in line with our expectations given the margin environment, seasonal impacts and planned maintenance we experienced during the quarter.","The margin environment remained challenging in the second quarter as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and industry product margins. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6 billion in the quarter. After adjusting for changes in working capital, which were primarily seasonal in nature and consistent. ","CapEx for the quarter was $8 billion and through the first half of the year CapEx is $15 billion representing 50% of the full year guidance we provided in March. The free cash flow deficit in the second quarter is a result of our strategy focused on the long-term and grow shareholder value across commodity cycles leveraging our financial capacity.","I'll now go through a more detailed view of developments since the first quarter on the next slide. Starting first with the Upstream. Average crude oil prices were higher than the first quarter with Brent up $5.63 and WTI up $4.93. ExxonMobil's liquids realizations increased by $5.09 in line with the increase in crude markers.","Gas realizations on the other hand were down in the second quarter. This was consistent with the typical three month to six month crude-linked LNG pricing lag that we experienced and a $0.51 decline in Henry Hub pricing as production growth continues to outpace demand in the U.S","Gas realizations were also impacted by weaker prices in Europe with lower seasonal demand and an increase in LNG imports. Production in the Permian averaged 274,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 21% relative to the first quarter. Permian production is up nearly 90% from the average production we saw in the second quarter of last year. In addition, the three exploration discoveries in Guyana in the first half of the year, we recently completed construction of the FPSO for Liza Phase 1, Liza Destiny which is now in transit to Guyana.","We also made a final investment decision for the 220,000 barrel per day Liza Phase 2 project and we updated the resource estimate to more than 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels. We also progressed toward a final investment decision for the Mozambique LNG project by securing approval of Rovuma development plan from the Mozambique government. ","We announced plans to expand unconventional operations in Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin and expanded our growing Deepwater exploration portfolio including the acquisition of 7 million deepwater exploration acres offshore Namibia.","In the Downstream, industry refining margins improved during the quarter, but remained near five-year lows. Unrelated reliability events at the Baytown, Sarnia and Yanbu refineries negatively impacted second quarter results. We expanded our Group II lubricant base stocks portfolio with increased production from the Rotterdam hydrocracker and a further expansion in Singapore.","Although, long-term fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business, Paraxylene margins weakened during the second quarter as a result of supply length from recent industry capacity additions. We achieved another important milestone in our plans to grow high-value premium Chemical product sales with the startup of the polyethylene expansion at Beaumont, which will capture integration benefits with the Baytown steam cracker. And once lined out it's expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the current margin environment.","We also announced a final investment decision for the Gulf Coast growth venture in Corpus Christi where with our partner SABIC we will construct a 1.8 million ton per year steam cracker and derivative units.","We continue to progress research and development of lower emissions technologies. In the quarter, we signed a joint development agreement with Global Thermostat to advance breakthrough technology to capture and concentrate carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources including power plants.","We also initiated a partnership with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory to research and develop a range of lower emissions technologies with a specific focus on ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and storage to commercial scale. Both of these important efforts are aligned with our focus on leveraging fundamental science to develop breakthrough solutions that can help reduce global emissions.","Let's now move to Slide 6 for an overview of second quarter earnings relative to the first quarter of the year. Second quarter earnings of $3.1 billion were up nearly $800 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were up approximately $400 million driven by higher liquids realizations and onetime tax items, partly offset by lower natural gas prices.","Downstream earnings increased by more than $700 million due to improved fuels margins, wider North American crude differentials, and the absence of negative mark-to-market derivative impacts. Improvements in Downstream earnings were partly offset by the previously mentioned reliability events. And finally Chemical earnings were lower by $330 million with higher scheduled maintenance and weaker paraxylene margins.","Turning to Slide 7, I'll expand on the impressive year-over-year increase in Upstream volumes. Production in the second quarter of 2019 was 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of more than 260,000 oil equivalent barrels per day relative to the second quarter of last year representing a 7% increase.","The higher volume was driven by production growth of 129,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian which represents an 89% increase than the prior year quarter. Increased production from Hebron and Kaombo also contributed to the higher volumes.","Lower maintenance in Canada, and the absence of impacts from the earthquake in Papua New Guinea, combined with stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe, provided additional volume uplift.","The bottom left chart highlights the strong year-over-year liquids growth of 177,000 barrels per day, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of 2018. Importantly, this marks the highest quarterly liquids production since 2016 and the highest second quarter liquids production in a decade.","Moving to Slide 8, I'll review the second quarter of 2019 cash flow. Second quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes of working capital yielded $6 billion in cash flow from operating activities. There was a $1.2 billion draw on working capital in the quarter, driven primarily by lower seasonal payables. This impact is in line with a typical seasonal pattern of a working capital draw in the second quarter which has been on average about $2 billion over the last decade.","Other items included the impact from the Alberta tax rate change which resulted in a noncash benefit to earnings of approximately $500 million. While no significant asset sales have completed year-to-date, asset marketing activities are in line with our divestment plans and consistent with our expectation of generating $15 billion from asset sales by the end of 2021.","Second quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $6.9 billion, driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian basin. Gross debt increased by approximately $4 billion in the quarter and cash ended the quarter at $4.2 billion.","As I have discussed and as you can see we are leveraging our financial capacity to invest in advantaged value accretive projects through the commodity price cycle. This is an important element of our strategy, so let me provide some additional perspective on the next slide.","The chart at the top left of the page provides a view of commodity prices and margins over the past 10 years and the relative position of the environment we've seen in the first half of 2019 to that range.","While margins so far this year have been on the low end of the 10-year range across many of our businesses these levels are consistent with historical experience and importantly, consistent with the scenarios that we anticipate when we make investment decisions.","In fact even in today's market environment as mentioned the recent Chemical and refining project startups that I recently highlighted are contributing positive earnings and cash flow. The cyclical nature of these businesses makes it critically important to have the financial capacity to invest across commodity price cycles and grow the dividend.","Over the past several years we've taken advantage of these downturns and commodity prices to assemble the best set of opportunities that we've had in 20 years and we are now investing consistent with our strategy to capture value from those opportunities. This combination of financial capacity to invest through the cycle and a deep portfolio of attractive investments is unique in the industry.","The chart on the bottom left of the page highlights our annual free cash flow generation over the past several years. Cumulative free cash flow over this time period is well in excess of our cumulative dividend.","This provided a strong basis to make value accretive investments and grow the dividend over time. And we view those two efforts as being closely linked together. The ability to grow the dividend requires continued investments in accretive, resilient opportunities across price cycles.","During times of price volatility, we keep the long term in mind as there can be a number of opportunities to capture incremental value by investing when others are pulling back. With our financial strength and a competitively advantaged portfolio we've been able to invest counter-cyclically in a number of key growth areas taking advantage of attractive low-cost environments.","I'll now provide some perspective on our outlook for the third quarter starting on slide 10. In the Upstream, we expect volumes in the third quarter to be in line with the second quarter. We will also see the impact of the absence of the second quarter onetime non-U.S. tax help of approximately $500 million.","In the Downstream, we expect Permian crude differentials to narrow as additional takeaway capacity comes online. Industry refining margins are expected to be in line with seasonal demand patterns. Scheduled maintenance in the third quarter should be significantly lower relative to the second quarter.","Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure, as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions. Consistent with the Downstream, scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the third quarter is also expected to be lower. And I'll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance on the next slide.","As we've previously discussed, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream this year will be higher than normal, in part due to preparation for IMO 2020. Planned maintenance and downtime tends to be seasonal, in line with demand patterns. And consistent with this, we expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the third quarter to be lower relative to what we experienced in the second quarter.","And then in the fourth quarter, we anticipate maintenance activity to pick up as we enter into the fall maintenance season, but activity again should remain below second quarter levels. The estimated earnings impacts for the third and fourth quarter for the Downstream are shown on the upper left chart.","In the Chemical business, shown on the bottom left chart, we also expect lower scheduled maintenance, with the impact in the third and fourth quarters below what we saw in the second quarter. We hope this provides you with some helpful perspectives on key drivers of anticipated market and planned factors for the upcoming quarter.","And with that, at this time, I'd like to hand it over to Neil.","Neil Chapman","Good morning everyone. It's good to be back on the call. As Neil said, before we take your questions, I'd like to share my perspective on the second quarter results, then I'm going to provide a few updates to the plans that we laid out in our New York March discussions.","I want to start by acknowledging the strong liquids growth. As I said many times, volume is not a target. It is an outcome of our plans to grow value. Nevertheless, our liquids growth reflects well on the organization maintaining the schedule in the early stages of executing our Upstream growth plans.","In terms of those growth plans, the ones we laid out in New York, I feel we're making outstanding progress. Permian growth is strong and on schedule. Guyana project plans are on or slightly ahead of schedule. And in the Downstream and Chemicals, 11 of the 19 projects that we laid out in New York last year are online and we FID-ed another six in the second quarter, going to provide some further details on these in the following slides.","We are in a unique position versus the rest of industry. We have a very attractive opportunity set. These are the advantaged projects that are robust at the bottom of the cycle conditions. So we have a very attractive opportunity set and we have the financial capacity to pursue them in a business that is very cyclical.","In the second quarter, three of our major businesses were at low points in their cycles. As you heard from Neil, that's been a major factor on our quarterly results. While we obviously prefer margins to be at the top of the cycle, the current margin scenario was contemplated and we have the financial capacity to maintain our plans. In fact, we've built our growth strategies, based on a full range of potential industry margins and the impact they would have on our financial results. That is why we put such importance on having a strong balance sheet to enable us to proceed with our long-term investment plans and weather through the cyclical nature of our business.","On a whole our businesses performed extremely well during the second quarter, actually they have in the first half of the year. Chemicals and Upstream reliability has been excellent and refining has also been strong with the exception of the three discrete incidents. The one in Sarnia, Canada; one in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; and the one in Baytown, Texas that Neil referenced.","Although, these are one-offs, they're not systemic to our overall performance. In total, we estimate the second quarter impact from these three instances to be of the tune of $150 million of earnings, that's the earnings impact. Of course, this is disappointing. Baytown and the Yanbu facility are now back in full production and Sarnia will be at marginally lower rates through the fourth quarter.","I want to take this opportunity to update you on the fire that occurred at our Baytown olefins plant earlier this week. First and foremost is the safety of our people and those in the surrounding community. I'm pleased to say, there were no reported serious injuries. An investigation into the cause of the incident and the potential damage continues. And frankly at this stage, it's really too early to say much more than that.","On the larger point of reliability, of course, it's an important focus area for us. It has been for a long time. We benchmark extensively and our Downstream facilities are ranked consistently better than the industry average. However, we must eliminate the significant one-off events, as we're just not satisfied with being an above average industry performer.","We're progressing a comprehensive reliability improvement program that we initiated late last year. This is leveraging insights across our Upstream, Refining and Chemical businesses and it's also reaching out to leaders outside of our industry to ensure that we leave no stone unturned in our drive to lead industry reliability at all times.","Slide 14 summarizes the progress of our major portfolio. Starting with the Upstream, I'm going to provide some more details on Permian and Guyana on the subsequent following pages. In Brazil, our Carcara development is proceeding on schedule. We expect to spud the first exploration well on Uirapuru and that's the block that's adjacent to Carcara with our partner Petrobras in the second half of this year.","We passed two significant milestones with host government approvals of our development plans for the Papua LNG in Papua New Guinea and Rovuma in Mozambique. In the Downstream, our three investments at Beaumont, Rotterdam and Antwerp these are all upgrading low-value streams to high-value streams, they're lined out and all are contributing to earnings and cash. And in the second quarter, we completed the FID of the three remaining major refinery projects that are in our growth plans.","In Chemicals, you the new Baytown cracker and two polyethylene plants are performing well, and the expansion of the high-margin thermoplastic elastomer business in Santoprene started up in May of this year. All these investments are also accretive to current earnings.","We started up the third polyethylene plant at Beaumont in July and that was one month ahead of schedule. We also completed the FIDs of four major new world-scale plants in the first half three of which were in the second quarter. At the new polypropylene line at Baton Rouge, our linear alpha olefins plant at Baytown that will be a new product to ExxonMobil's Chemical portfolio and expansion to our industry-leading high-margin propylene plastomer business at Vistamaxx, which is also at Baytown and the largest steam cracker that we have ever built plus the derivatives at Corpus Christi.","On slide 15, you can see that our unconventional Permian and Bakken volumes are growing in line with plan. We increased our Permian volumes by 20% in the second quarter, which is up 90% versus the second quarter last year. We're now at 51 rigs and 12 frac crews in the Permian and we brought 67 wells to sales in the second quarter.","Our unique development plans which are focused on maximizing long-term value of the resource and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil to drive capital efficiency are delivering encouraging results. The rocks and well performance is extremely strong. And as I said previously our approach is to understand the impact of development and operating practices on both IP rates and long-term recovery. Drilling a single well and applying a larger completion with higher intensity fracture can yield higher IPs, but it may yield lower ultimate recovery versus drilling several wells with less intense completions.","Capital efficiency is critical and it's an area where our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. It's all about balancing capital outlay IPs and the ultimate recovery to achieve the highest value. We've ramped up activity above surface with the ongoing construction of our Cowboy Central Delivery Point facilities in the Poker Lake region of the Delaware. And we finalized the FID to proceed with the greater than one million barrel a day liquids pipeline to the Gulf Coast. The Permian level activity is high and we're making great progress.","Page 16, our first FPSO Liza Destiny is en route to Guyana. We started the schedule for the first quarter of next year, but I'm optimistic we'll do better than that. We completed the FID on the second FPSO at Liza-2, which is close to double the size of Liza-1 in the second quarter and that will start up in 2022. The startup of the third FPSO for the Payara and Pacora development remains on schedule for 2023 startup.","We've had three further discoveries in the first half of 2019 Haimara, Tilapia and Yellowtail. We're continuing to assess the results of these discoveries and are not yet ready to finalize their resource size. However, the Stabroek resource will be 6-plus billion oil-equivalent barrels and again as I've said before this resource continues to grow.","We anticipate three further exploration wells in the second half. They are likely to include Tripletail Uaru and Maku with a potential fourth one to spud before year-end. We currently have three drillships in the basin, and the fourth will be on station in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left, we've included a chart to illustrate the continuing increase in our inventory of future exploration prospects.","I've included page 17 to remind you about Upstream divestment plans through 2021. We've previously communicated that we anticipate asset sales of $15 billion. As I said before, the $15 billion is a risk number and anticipate that some of the divestment candidates that we put in the market will not realize our retention value. But the marketing program is on track and includes the assets listed on the right. We're also in marketing discussions in other assets that are not public, so I have not of course listed them here. Again, this program is on schedule and we anticipate delivering the $15 billion previously communicated.","Finally on slide 18, a quick update on the significant growth milestones in our integrated ethylene and polyethylene business on the Gulf Coast. The Baytown and Mont Belvieu investments have been aligned for some time. And as I said earlier, are accretive to earnings even at the current low margins. The polyethylene units at Mont Belvieu started up in 2017 and are operating at capacity. The ethylene steam cracker at Baytown, which started up last year is operating at 10% above design capacity.","The third polyethylene line at Beaumont started up in July ahead of schedule. This was the first line in the world to start up on the higher value, but notoriously difficult to produce in a gas phase reactor metallocene polyethylene and that was from the first day of operations. We're very pleased that our startup was flawless.","In the second quarter, we completed the FID of the largest steam cracker we will ever build, plus the derivatives and they're going to be located in Corpus with our partner SABIC. This will be highly advantaged versus the industry Gulf Coast investments based on location, and of course the adjacency to the Permian lower capital costs and high-value products.","Startup is scheduled for 2022. The fundamentals supporting these Chemical investments remain strong. All of this is being done to what we know will be increasing global demand supported by population growth and the growing middle class.","In summary, our organization is absolutely focused on delivering the operating performance we expect to-date and on delivering our growth plans. We have a high level of confidence that we will deliver and our performance through the first half of this year demonstrates that we're on track.","And with that, Neil I'll hand back to you for Q&A.","Neil Hansen","Great. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for your comments, Neil. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Chapman and Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Neil great to have you back on the call. Neil, I've got two questions, if I may. My first one not to be terribly predictable but \u2013 is on Guyana. Clearly, the exploration program Hammerhead you've dedicated both assets to appraisal drilling. I know you're \u2013 as I understand it from your partner you're going off to kind of fully appraise what could be a major development hub in the Longtail Turbot area.","So I just wonder, if I could just push you a little bit on why you have not yet chosen to revisit the likely production trajectory, because it clearly looks like you are running well ahead not least because to have a fourth and fifth boat and still had 750 means those would be undersized. So just could you frame for us what you see the potential like today on how that would play into on your 2025 outlook which is clearly out of date?","Neil Chapman","Yes, a bit out of date. You know, it's -- what we communicated in March was this big increase getting up to 750 KBD by that time. I would tell you, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the basin. I want to start at that point.","As we said, we have the first boat on the way. We have the second boat in construction. We have three drillships. We have a tremendous amount of activity going on. And all of these items -- we're going at a great, great pace. We have to get up -- maintain alignment with our partners and with the government on each one.","What I'm really focused on and the organization is focused on primarily is delivering on what we communicated to you and to the investment community. And that's the numbers we laid out in March. Of course, as I indicated, there are some -- we're very optimistic that that will be at least what we will do. We're just not ready to make another change to up either the production outlook or at this stage anything more on the resource base.","You mentioned Hammerhead. Let me just make a couple of comments on Hammerhead. I think you are aware that we drilled two more wells on Hammerhead recently and the results were positive. I would describe them as reinforcing the high-quality reservoirs. We've now drilled three wells in Hammerhead. They're in communication, the press is in communication, which means there's very good connectivity which again suggests that there's good news at development planning.","You talked about appraisal drilling. You know, we're going to be doing some appraisal drilling on Ranger, which we've not quantified yet. That's the large carbonate structure, of course. All of that being said, we just have a tremendous amount of activity going on. I want the organization focused on delivering what we've committed to. And frankly, the next significant update in terms of outlook for production, I don't think we'll give anything different until an update in March next year.","Doug Leggate","Well, I can obviously -- well, I didn't want to be impertinent by saying out of date, so let me just clarify what I meant. When you first gave the 2025 target, the guidance was 500,000 barrels a day. It's now more than 750,000 and you still haven't changed the 2020. I know it's a long way away, but that was my point.","But my follow-up Neil is probably a little bit an off the ball question, kind of related to the disposal pace on the kind of the use of proceeds. My understanding is that you recently conducted a study with a buy side on opinions on share buybacks return of cash to shareholders and how you would -- how you might consider that in the future perhaps even with a potential to lean on the balance sheet.","I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to what was behind that the reason for that survey and whether you're still comfortable with the pace of the disposal program you laid out at the Analyst Day. Now, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I mean again, Neil can maybe make a comment in a second, on the specifics of the survey. Let me just make some comments on the disposal program. We highlighted $15 billion. I told the investment community that was a risk number. In other words, I anticipate we'll have to put more in the market to achieve that number. We're on track with that. I would tell you we're -- we communicated that in March.","We're just four months into a three-month program. And so -- a three-year program rather. And we're on track with the marketing. What we said, at that time, was in terms of our capital allocation that there's no change in the priority continuous -- our use of cash use of capital starts with investing with value-accretive projects.","Secondly, we're going to maintain our growing dividend. We want to maintain our financial flexibility and then we'll look at how else -- what else we do with the cash in terms of buybacks. And that's the way, I think we have discussed it for many years and we'll reinforce that in March.","Of course, we indicated then that with $15 billion on the planning basis that could result in returning some cash to the shareholders. But we will look at that as that cash comes in, and we'll set that based on the market conditions at the time. Neil, do you want to talk about the survey?","Neil Hansen","Yes. No, again just as Neil mentioned, the discussions we've had with a few buy-side firms, I wouldn't classify it as a survey. We certainly reach out to them to talk about how you might execute a buyback program. It wasn't intended to get a different perspective on our capital allocation priority, which as Neil mentioned, remain the same. It was more to gain a perspective from a few buy-side firms on -- if you execute buybacks what's the best approach to do that, what's the philosophy you should take. But again, Doug, I wouldn't classify this as a survey. It was a discussion with a handful of the buy-side firms of some of our larger shareholders.","Doug Leggate","Understood. Appreciate the answers guys, and thanks again for getting on Neil.","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","Hi, everybody. Neil financial results in the first half of 2019 seem to be tracking below the plan highlighted at Analyst Day for 2020. Although the company made clear at the time that those projections were predicated upon flat Brent rail and flat Downstream and Chemical margins too. So my question is when adjusting for market factors and whatever else you may deem appropriate, are you still comfortable with the 11% return on capital employed and $25 billion annual earnings figures for 2020? And if so, what factors will help bridge the gap from the first half 2019 actuals to the full year 2020 projections? Or do you think we'll get there solely from normalization of the market factors that Neil mentioned on page 9 in his opening comments?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. What Neil is -- I \u2013 again, we got -- we have Neil\u2019s quiet here of course, but if in doubt -- I'm -- this is Neil Chapman. I'm going to answer the question. Doug, I would say, remember when we laid out this plan in March 2018 what we were trying to indicate is the earnings power, the cash flow power that we're bringing into the business at constant prices and at flat margins. At that time, we said we did a flat $60 dollars a barrel and we do it for Chemicals and Downstream at 2017 actual margins and that was our intention.","And of course, we go back and skewered our performance. And I think that's what you're asking is how are we doing if you take away the price and margin impacts of the current earnings. I would say we're pretty much matching the plan. The significant -- the concern we've had of course has been these reliability events, particularly the ones that we\u2019ve had in the Downstream.","Outside of the ones that we reported in the first and second quarter, there's nothing material that's changed from our plan that we laid out last year. It doesn't mean to say there aren't pluses and minuses. It doesn't mean to say we have some positive surprises and some negative surprises, I think that would be naive to say everything is absolutely perfect. But on average, I would suggest that we're pretty much tracking the plan, and there's no reason at this stage for us to adjust those outlooks that we laid out 18 months or so ago.","Doug Terreson","Okay. No, I realize its imperfect, but just wanted to try to get a gauge on it. So, thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.","Sam Margolin","Good morning. My first question is about the Permian. The industry for a while now but maybe coming to a head here it seems to be having some issues with spacing and its impact on productivity. We don't have a lot of precise numbers about your spacing, but we do know that your development plan calls for -- call it a high concentration of lateral feet per square mile or they're just -- you have a lot of wells that are stacking up in your section.","So can you talk about just broadly this might be too complex a question. I don't want to get too esoteric, but just broadly how you're managing some of these issues we're seeing in the industry given the nature of your development plan in the Permian?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Simon it\u2019s -- of course, like you I read as many of the different results in the industry. I would tell you that in terms of our planning basis, again it's unchanged from the detailed plan that I laid out in March. And what I said at that time that we are driving a different approach than the industry with these really leveraging a combination of this large contiguous acreage that we've had and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil. And, of course, you will recall that I went through all of that.","I also discussed at that time that we are working on plans that we'll develop and drill multiple horizontal benches at one time. Our feeling -- there is communication between these horizontal benches. And if you go in and drill one bench now and expect to come back years later and drill the other benches, we do see or we do believe there's communication between the benches and it should dissipate. And our belief is that drilling of multiple benches simultaneously in the approach that I laid out appears to be the right way to go.","We're at the very early stages of that. Frankly it's too early to highlight anything new from what I said back in March of last year. I am aware that there are competitors out there who've looked at spacing and have moved along a line of having closer spacing than we have in our plans. I have heard that. I think everybody in the industry has read about that.","My understanding is the company involved in that has pulled back from it. It hasn't been successful. We have not taken that approach. Our spacing is not as tight as that. So it's early days. We have nothing new to report versus what we said last time. As I said, we are on plan and nothing different.","Sam Margolin","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. We'll go back to the March materials. My follow-up is on Chemicals and it's sort of a macro question. And you highlighted that there's some margin headwinds in the industry right now due to capacity, but capacity continues to get sanctioned globally. There's FID in the face of this margin pressure.","And so I was wondering for your perspective on the demand side. Are you seeing a big pull for new supply in the petchem chain even with some capacity related margin headwinds now? And does that say anything about the longer term cycle and what your high-level views on the chem side are?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Sam I would tell you that and again in Chemical just to break it down to the individual products, and of course we are heavily focused on ethylene and polyethylene and those are the margins that we typically talk about. And Neil highlighted the paraxylene business, but let me talk about ethylene and polyethylene because that's the major driver of our Chemical business.","Polyethylene demand grows at about 1.5 times GDP. And as I recall, the ethylene market is about 150 million tons globally. And so what that means is you need three to four new crackers per year just to meet demand, three to four worldscale crackers per year. Actually what we see right now is the demand remains very robust around the world. It's all driven by the growing middle class around the world. That's the driver for plastics, that's the driver for polyethylene. That middle-class having a high standard of living and that drives the assumption of polyethylene.","So actually globally we see the demand remaining very robust. There's no changes at all. What happened is there has been a glut of capacity. And so capacity is higher than demand. In the polyethylene business, unlike some of the other commodity businesses we're in, the demand sets it up relatively quickly.","Now I will tell you that there are some further increments of capacity in ethylene and polyethylene to come online in the next year or so. So we don't see any change in the fundamentals at all.","The glut in supply today is all because of these new capacity increments, most of which are on the Gulf Coast. So I think the short-term margins and if I was to try and predict short-term margins inevitably I would get it wrong, we do. But because of these extra increments of capacity that are coming on in the next 12 months, I would anticipate it to be pretty soft during that period.","Now I've been in the chemical business for most of my career I think most of you know. And the Chemical business is notorious for coming back faster than anybody anticipates, but on a planning basis, I'd expect it to remain soft at least for the coming six months.","Sam Margolin","Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Hey good morning. Good to talk to you Neil and Neil. So the first question I had was just around European gas. Obviously we've seen softness in global gas prices. Groningen is a smaller part of the business mix than it was a couple of years ago. But can you just frame out, how big that European gas is as a part of the business on a go-forward-basis? And is that a risk to profitability at the upstream -- of the upstream group?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I mean I'll give you some approximate numbers here, Neil. I think in terms of volumes of gas in our portfolio, about 75% of our volumes from gas is what we call flowing gas, 25% is liquefied natural gas. And of that 75% flowing gas, about half is in the U.S. and half is in the European markets. I'm just going to break it down for you.","Of that European, about half is Groningen and half is a combination of as I remember roughly Germany, U.K. and Norway. So it's a relatively large part in terms of volume. It is not a relatively large part in terms of the earnings of our business.","What I would tell you is the spot price as you've seen in LNG has dropped significantly, of course, over the last six months. Japanese, JK and market price plus the MVP price in Europe. And that's what's impacting the flowing gas prices. And what we have seen is we have seen continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia. That's been the growth driver over many years. It's just a little -- it's not as high for the six months of this year as it has been in the previous two years. I mean -- as I remember don't quote me these are approximate numbers.","I believe year-to-date Asia LNG demand is up about 3% which is lower than it has been and the global demand or global supply of LNG is up north of 10%. So, what happens there, those cargoes look for a home and they can't find a home in Asia, they will get directed towards Europe that puts pressure on the European price. And if you look at the European gas business, the inventory level is quite high in Europe as well right now. That's what's putting the pressure on the spot LNG price and that's what's putting pressure on the flowing gas price.","Neil Mehta","That's helpful Neil. I guess the follow-up is relative to even at the Analyst Day, Exxon's shares have outperformed your smaller independent competitors in places like the Permian. How do you think about the environment for M&A and Exxon's role in consolidation in the Lower 48?","Neil Chapman","Well first of all, I'd tell you that, we're eyes wide open. We're always looking for opportunities. I mean -- and I think one of the reasons you maintain a strong balance sheet, it gives you that flexibility to act if you see something of value. I always start in the upstream with this. We have the strongest portfolio of opportunities this corporation has -- in the Upstream this corporation has had since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. In other words we don't need to do anything. I feel very, very comfortable with the growth plans that we have laid out to you and we see and we can execute through 2025 and beyond. So, we have the capacity to do something. We don't need to do anything from a business. What we need to do is execute our current set of opportunities. So, that's a great position to be in.","But we look all the time for value-added opportunities. So, I think that's a great part about looking at the portfolio. It's all a question of, if something is out there, which is competitive in our portfolio in other words, upgrades the portfolio and we can bring a competitive advantage versus industry. I mean that's the way we look at it.","In the Lower 48, in the Permian specifically, I hear like you all hear a lot of chatter about potential consolidation down the road. But the market -- that will play out in the market. For us, what I like to say to our organization eyes wide open. If there's an opportunity out there, bring it forward. But I really want to make the point that we don't need to act. We don't believe we need to act right now. We have a great opportunity set as it is. Do you have anything to add here, Neil?","Neil Hansen","Well, I guess that's absolutely right, Neil. And given the portfolio that we have, we can be patient, we can be opportunistic and if we do see an opportunity to bring unique value with our competitive advantages and we can bring in something that's accretive to the value of our overall portfolio, then obviously we would be very interested in that type of an opportunity.","Neil Chapman","Yes I do. Just to go back to the Permian again and reinforce the point I have made my terms. We are taking a different approach to the Permian. I mean we are taking an approach which is leveraging the scale of this corporation. It's a manufacturing approach. We're doing it at scale, which obviously a lot of the small players wouldn't have the capacity to do that. And we're going to do it through the cycles. We have the capacity to do that. We believe we have a significant capital advantage by doing it that way. And as a result of that, I think if we can demonstrate and we will and we are demonstrating that, we can demonstrate it. It puts us in a position where we have an advantage development plan that we could apply that to other resources in the basin should we see fit to do so.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, guys.","Neil Chapman","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi good morning. I guess my question, my first question, so it's a bit of a follow-up to a couple of questions that have been asked maybe slightly differently. If we look at the quarter, there's a fair amount of debt added this quarter and you talked about kind of just investing through the cycle. You have the $15 billion of asset sales that you're targeting over the next three years and you want to keep the balance sheet ready if an M&A opportunity comes along. But if we look at it that way and think about the way the script looks right now, does it make more sense to not think about share buybacks to just keep the balance sheet in the best shape you can with assets or proceeds as you invest through the cycle? Just want to kind of tie that altogether? Thanks.","Neil Chapman","I'll start and then Neil maybe you can add anything you want to add. But I think the strength of this balance sheet is really important of course, but it's being demonstrated by the current market conditions because as I said in my other comments, we feel very strongly. We have the capacity to maintain our investment plans through these low points in the commodity cycle.","Actually, we -- at the current conditions if they were maintained and we see these as very low as you have seen and Neil pointed out from his chart, if they were to maintain those conditions, we still believe we have the capacity to execute our plans if these conditions would remain through 2025 and still have some powder to execute an acquisition should we want to do so. But of course, it's something you watch closely. You're constantly looking at that all of the time. But today and on a planning basis, we feel like we have the capacity to make no change at all to our plans. And even if these low margins continued, we can continue with our plans. Neil, do you have anything to add to that?","Neil Hansen","Yes. I am just -- thinking back to the Investor Day Phil, when we talked about this, we conveyed that we felt very comfortable with the investment program that we have available to us. We talked about the priority of doing a reliable growing dividend and that we felt comfortable with the balance sheet and that we didn't feel at that time that we need to do any additional maintenance on the balance sheet. And so to the extent, we had proceeds coming from asset sales or additional cash coming from higher prices and margins given where we were in those priorities likely the cash would then come back through buybacks, but that was obviously given a current or an assumed price and margin environment and we are in a different environment today, but when these proceeds come in from these asset sales, which is a target out to 2021, we don't know what environment we will be in at that time.","So it's difficult to predict exactly where that cash would go, but we can reaffirm what the priorities are. We're going to continue to invest in accretive projects, pay a reliable growing dividend and ensure that we have the capacity and the financial strength to take advantage of opportunities that become available to us including when we have a downturn in margin to prices which is as we said a very attractive time to operate and invest when costs are lower and when others are pulling back. So, there's no change to the priorities. What happens when that additional cash comes in from those proceeds again, could occur over the next two or three years, it will be dependent I think on the price and margin environment at that time and what opportunities we see available to us.","Neil Chapman","And Phil, I'd tell you, this is not something new for us. I mean, if you go back to the low crude oil prices in 2015-2016 that's when we lent into the business and made the acquisitions in the Permian, in Mozambique, in Papua New Guinea and in Brazil. And again, I go back to the strength of opportunities that we have right now is because at that low point in the cycle we have the capacity to move and pick-up some very attractive resources at very competitive prices.","Phil Gresh","I appreciate that and obviously you can't time the asset sales quarter-to-quarter so certainly can appreciate that. On the Chemical side, I guess my follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked is that if I look at the performance of ExxonMobil specifically over the past five quarters your earnings have gone down every quarter.","And I know this quarter you had some maintenance so some of that will come back here. But if I look relative to other some of your other peers where you have traditionally kind of tracked their performance, I think they have seen a bit better performance recently and yours has continued to degrade and so just kind of shifting through the sides I know you called Paraxylene as one factor. Is that -- if you're to kind of disaggregate the performance would you say that that is the primary factor that you think is differentiating your softer performance recently? Or are there other things we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Well, I think there are other things. I think what you have to start with in the Chemical business is looking at the configuration of the assets that each Chemical company has and our business is heavily weighted towards steam cracking and polyethylene by order of magnitude and it's sort of 65% of our Chemical business.","Polyethylene and ethylene margins for us have been very strong for multiple years and we've benefited from that. And at this stage of the cycle the ethylene polyethylene margins for the reasons that we already discussed are down. If you have a Chemical company that has 25% of its business in ethylene, polyethylene and the rest of the business in other products you probably wouldn't see that impact of ethylene and polyethylene. It's really driven by the configuration of assets that you had.","If we look across our Chemical company's performance over the last 12 months in terms of operations, in terms of delivering on their higher-margin growth it's been at or above plan. The total impact we are seeing is because of industry margins being down due to overcapacity. That has been primarily driven by ethylene and polyethylene primarily driven by these big incremental capacity coming on the Gulf Coast.","Paraxylene is similar. Paraxylene is also a significant part of our Chemical company nowhere near the size of ethylene and polyethylene. There has been some big capacity increments of Paraxylene that has come online in China in the recent months and that's put Paraxylene margins under pressure. These are cyclical businesses.","The performance has no change. The underlying drivers of these businesses are unchanged. The underlying drivers for demand are unchanged. What's really important for us is that we continue to deliver more competitive steam crackers in polyethylene businesses than anybody else. That's why I made the comments when we were talking about the latest investment to Corpus Christi.","This is significantly advantaged we believe versus any other Gulf Coast investment. It's a significantly lower capital cost. We're leveraging the scale of our Upstream organization. We located the plant so close to the Permian. It's a cost advantage and we are producing not commodity polyethylene, but higher value or higher margin polyethylene. And so we don't see any change to the structure of this business. This is a margin impact-driven by short-term excess in supply.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Appreciate the comment. ","Neil Chapman","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS.","Jon Rigby","Good afternoon and also good morning. Thanks for taking questions. Two please. The first is, I hear what you say about M&A opportunities and so on in the Permian and I guess, those will come around periodically and you'll take a look at those when and if they arise. But we've got the surplus transfer rights opportunity coming up in Brazil in November and you could argue that that is somewhat more singular. ","Neil Chapman","Yes.","Jon Rigby","So I just wonder whether you could talk a little more about what your attitude is to that? And maybe if I just add my second question straight away\u2026. ","Neil Chapman","Sure.","Jon Rigby","I was just looking at your CapEx profile in the U.S. in the Upstream and I see it bumping up both sequentially and year-over-year and I guess that may in part have something to do with your comments around infrastructure build out. So I just thought maybe it would be good opportunity if you could just sort of lay out the activity in a little bit more detail around infrastructure as well as the drilling activity. Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jon. Let me start with the transfer of rights in Brazil. B\u00fazios, which of course, is the big reservoir down there the big resource that's in those transfer of rights. I mean, that's the largest one there are other ones of course, but B\u00fazios is by far the largest. Because it is so large I think everybody in the industry will have a look at that. I'd be very surprised if they didn't. But it is very, very large. It is singular. Those kind of sizes of what I'd call discovered resources it's relatively well-delineated.","The way I look at it is we have to bring some advantage to that versus anybody else in the industry. And if I can find a way where we can bring a significant advantage therefore we can get more value for our shareholders and we don't just get into a bidding war versus other players because I mean that's not the business. We want to be able to bring an advantage to that resource should we want to participate.","We are looking at that resource as I am very, very confident all the major players are in the world. It doesn't mean to say that we're going to act on it Jon, but we're certainly looking at it. It is a large resource and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. And obviously I don't think you'd expect me to say much more than that.","And in terms of CapEx, actually I'm very proud of where we are. With 50% as a corporation of our CapEx plan in the middle of the year and actually if you peel the onion back further with 50% of our CapEx plan in the Upstream halfway through the year as well. So we're tracking in total on plan. It doesn't mean to say there aren't some puts and takes I mean there are.","I think in terms of the above surface buildout, particularly in the Delaware basin what I laid out in March is we have to put a lot of upfront money to build out those facilities both compression and these development corridors and all of the logistics within the basin. That's part of our plan.","I would tell you there are puts and takes in all of that. Overall, we are on plan. It's well documented that it is taking longer to drill these horizontal laterals in the Delaware right now than it is in the Midland. And you see the numbers -- you've all seen the numbers that are reported externally.","Key -- for all the players in the Delaware that we find a way to get those drilling times down closer to what we see in the Midland. We are working that we're making decent progress, of course, I want us to go faster, but we are making decent progress. So there's nothing really to flag outside of what we have already said. It is within the range of what we had expected. And today, our Permian production is accretive to earnings. We are making money in the Permian right now.","Jon Rigby","Well, thank you.","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.","Biraj Borkhataria","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one, a question on Pay, so, I understand the question for the pace of development in Guyana. And obviously you're taking advantage of the services available at very good prices.","For the Permian, are you concerned at all that the pace of your development. And the impact it could have on the overall oil market. I get not all of the growth is oil, but a substantial amount of that exponential growth chart is oil.","And then, if you take you guys plus Chevron and a handful of your peers, it looks like the majority of the sector wants to grow volumes faster than the market is growing, which suggests prices may be not that positive over the medium-term. So I just want to get, your thoughts on that. And whether you think it's a concern at all. Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Thanks, Biraj. I mean again I'll make some comments. And Neil, if you have any feel free, to jump in. I mean, I think, we laid out that pace and we said we are going to get to one million oil-equivalent barrels in the Permian and Bakken by 2024, if I remember correctly.","That's not driven by anything more than we see these. And it's extremely competitive. We see them as less outside of the supply curve. And we see them as high returns and within our capacity to execute them to the standards that we expect to execute them. That's the way we look at it.","What really is important, in a commodity cycle, in commodity businesses, is to make sure that, we have a competitive advantage versus anyone else in terms of cost of supply. And it's really driven by cost of supply. That's why I am so keen, that we maintain our capital discipline in the Permian.","We must continue to work the capital cost down and to deliver on what we have laid out in our plans. Remember, this is a declining business. You have to keep replacing your capacity. And what's key for us.","And key to win in this business is to make sure that our portfolio is the most competitive in the industry. And that's the basis of these plans. And the Permian is a big part of that. Do you have anything to add on that?","Neil Hansen","No. I guess the only thing I would add globally the market again remains balanced. Demand growth continues to be strong. Obviously, OPEC has remained committed to their cuts. You have oil that's off-line in Venezuela and Iran and other locations. So you are seeing growth in the Permian. But I think overall, we are still seeing a relatively balanced market.","Operator","All right. Your next question goes to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Neil Hansen","Good morning, Roger.","Neil Chapman","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","If we could come back to I think it was slide 9, the one showing the margins. And kind of where you are relative to the 10-year, I was just curious, so as we look particularly at the downstream and the Chemicals.","If you think about those margin performances call it a lost opportunity or adjusted for your downtime, kind of how much was truly margin loss versus had you run at a normal level of activity, where you think those margins might have been?","Can you help us think about maybe where cash flow should be back half of this year, given maybe more normalized levels of downtime?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Well. I'll make sure you I understand the question, Roger. What would be the impact, if we didn't have the reliability incidents, is that your question?","Roger Read","Yeah. What if we were to isolate only the margin aspect in terms of price or let's just say net margin the industry offered versus net margin you captured?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I think two things to bear in mind. I think in terms of our performance, in the first half of the year. And the second quarter in refining, I highlighted in my comments, that there was $150 million earnings impact from those three significant reliability events. Isolate those and that gives you a number.","There is a much larger impact from the heavier turnarounds, scheduled maintenance that we have. And Neil gave some numbers in terms of how that would manifest and how that will change in the third and fourth quarter. I don't know, Neil, if you have anything else to add?","Neil Hansen","Yeah. And Roger again, just so I understand what you're asking. The charts on slide 9, those are industry margins. Those are not the realization that we captured. Those are again somewhat reflective obviously of our footprint. But they are industry margins.","Neil Chapman","I think the other thing to -- really, really important here is, the industry margins manifest themselves differently in each of the refinery players. It depends on your configuration.","Just to give an example, if you have no refining assets in Europe and the European margins are low of course that will hit the European players. And not hit the players who don't have a footprint in Europe.","And even if you just go into one region, like the United States, the refineries are different. Some are high conversion refineries, some are low conversion refineries. There are different margins, for high and low margin.","In the U.S. there are different margins on the Gulf Coast versus the Midwest. And so, when you look at these margins, you have to peel back the onion further and apply the specific margins to the individual configuration, both geographic and technical configurations of your refining assets that differs from company to company.","What has been shown on the chart that Neil showed, was I think was an average of industry or an industry market price of this.","Neil Hansen","Yeah. That's right. And Roger, maybe just from a downtime, maintenance, earnings impact in the first half of the year. I think for the Downstream in the second quarter we showed on Chart 11 it's in roughly $500 million $600 million. So I think the first quarter was a little bit lower than that.","And then for Chemicals, it was a little bit below $200 million. And then we tried to show, on slide 11, what that looks like in the third and fourth quarter. So again down significantly, I think from what we have seen in the second quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some indication where we will be in the second half of the year.","Neil Chapman","Roger just to go back to my point on slide 9 that was Downstream margins, that reflects an equal weighting a-third, a-third, a-third of markets in the U.S. Europe and Asia. And so it's an average. It's an illustrative. But if you don't have a-third, a-third, a-third in those three regions then your margins could be different than that.","Roger Read","Yeah. For sure, I appreciate the clarification. Because my original interpretation was that was your margins not just industry margins.","Neil Chapman","Yeah.","Roger Read","Okay.","Neil Chapman","Thank you.","Roger Read","And then just as a follow-up question on the Permian. I mean, I know we have the chart that shows the pace there, but phenomenal performance in Q2 and familiar with timing of well completions things like that. As you think about Permian growth at this particular juncture is what we saw in Q2, what you believe becomes more representative? Or Q2 is just kind of one of those quarters where you're zigging and zagging a little bit? Just zigs just above the line and maybe over the next couple of quarters we zag back towards the line.","As Sam mentioned, we don't have a lot of clarity on a lot of what you're doing out there or at least not contemporaneously. So I was just curious to how you think about the performance in the Permian? And maybe where that shakes up?","Neil Chapman","Your vocabulary on zigging and zagging, I describe it as a lumpy. And the reason I say, it's lumpy is, because the way we are developing the Permian is that we can drill a lot of docks and we can frac a lot at different times. So I don't anticipate and if you go back to the chart when you see or read our actual performance, that's kind of what you're going to see.","You're not going to see the same growth every single quarter. But we are very confident that we can meet that what's a green famously called the green blob. But the green growth profile, Roger I'd say that's what we are going to -- we will meet. You\u2019re absolutely right, it will be a zigging and zagging, but it is not necessarily the way everyone would develop. It reflects our development plan that we're going to have particularly in the Delaware, these long corridors of well pads.","And we're going to drill up multiple benches at one time. And if you think about it move those drilling rigs down the corridor bring in those frac crews, frac them and then you'll see a boost in production. So I don't think it will be the right thing to do to look at every single quarter and say that we'll repeat that growth rate every single quarter. But I am very confident that we're going to meet the overall growth rate that we represented in that famous green production growth zone.","Roger Read","Great. Thank you.","Neil Chapman","Sure.","Operator","Next we'll go to Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Neil Chapman","Hi, Paul, thanks.","Paul Cheng","I have one Downstream, one Upstream. Neil for Permian, I think in March June you was mentioning that the rig count will probably go to about 55 exit rate this year and then next year may go to 60, 65 depends on the activity level. Is that still some of digging pain at this point or that has been changed based on the additional information you have seen over the last several months?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I would say the 55 number is a number that I would still think we will be at the year-end, and we haven't got any change in plan on that. I really don't -- I don't get fixated on the number of rigs quite frankly. I mean that was a sort of what we estimate we will have. If the productivity of these wells is better, we could reduce, I mean, that's all about this capital efficiency that I keep coming back to.","So as a planning basis, I mean, today we are up what I say 51, I think across both basins right now. That's in line with getting to sort of that 55 number call at the year-end, but it could be 53, it could be 56, 55 is the best planning basis I can give you.","Paul Cheng","Sorry. I guess my question is that I mean based on what you see over the last several months in the productivity and everything or within that I feel basically that is still the same plan that you haven't really changed. There's no material information that you have seen either improvement nor deterioration comparing to your current plan?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I mean, there is nothing to flag, because it is within the range of our planning basis. I mentioned a few minutes ago, what's really important is to increase or improve the drilling time in the Delaware. I read about numbers and people are saying in the industry that it is taking 30% longer to drill the same length well same length lateral in the Delaware as it is in the Midland.","Actually, I think it's a little bit different than that. There are some parts where that's too high and depending on the length of the lateral exchange, but it is indicative that it is taking longer, and that is a key activity for us to get that drilling time down, because this is obvious, if you can't get that drilling time down to the level that you expect to in your planning basis, you can do one of two things. You can cut back your volumes so you can add more rigs.","We still believe in our planning basis, we will get the productivity that we have and that reflects the number of rigs, the capital outlay and the volumes that we're predicting. But it is the most important thing Paul, I would tell you.","Paul Cheng","Sure.","Neil Chapman","And the way we're going about it is we have moved the total ExxonMobil capability into this basin. We are applying all of our drilling capabilities from all around the world to this very, very important area. And I feel very, very confident in our plans, I feel very comfortable with where we are heading. I wish we could close that gap faster.","Paul Cheng","And I think your -- from a rig count standpoint you're about 50-50 between Midland and Delaware. Should we assume that will be the case for the next one or two years?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. Actually, I'm not sure we're 50-50 right now. We're still -- we have more rigs in the Delaware today than we do in the Midland, but that's part of our development plan in the order of magnitude, if I remember, I think we have maybe, I think it is 29 in the Delaware and 22 in the Midland right now just for the numbers.","But our resource, our well inventory in the Delaware is much, much higher than it is in the Midland. And I think we've been quite clear and again I come back to -- this is such an early stage to jump to conclusions. And just to give you an indication, we estimate we have a well inventory in the Delaware of something around 6,500. So 6,500 well inventory, we drilled 100. We drilled 100. So it's very tough to extrapolate from 100 wells where you're going to be with 6,500.","And that's why I think it's so, so important that we stick to our long-term planning basis. We know what we have got to do, but to try and extrapolate and draw too many conclusions from that number of wells, I think it just needs -- I think we need to be careful about doing that.","Paul Cheng ","Right. Final question for me under the IMO 2020 world most of your ability in your refinery to take the high sulphur we see it as a feed directly to the coker with minimal system?","Neil Chapman","Yeah. I think as you know if you could sort of peel back the onion at IMO with these new regulations the shipowners have this multiple option. They can buy low sulfur fuel oil, they can install scrubbers or if they can switch to some other piece like liquefied natural gas."," The way that plan plays out is the demand for high sulfur recedes, we would anticipate it will decline and the demand for low sulfur will increase. And you would anticipate so that will -- that could lead to changing spreads of course. I think if you have low conversion refineries, you'll be incented to run -- to reduce sulfur by running sweet crudes. Our refineries particularly on the Gulf Coast are high conversion refineries with low fuel oil production.","And so we would say that we feel very well positioned in the U.S. We have high conversion refineries. We added this big new coker in Antwerp and we're investing in projects that reduce high sulfur fuel oil production in Singapore. So we've been planning this for a long, long time. The market will do what the market will do, but directionally we feel like we sit in a very strong and advantage position.","Paul Cheng","Sure. I guess my question is that I mean, can you take the high sulfur fuel oil and directly feed it into your coker as a feedstock instead of buying heavy oil? So replace the heavy oil run your refinery by using the high sulfur fuel oil I guess that's my question.","Neil Chapman","I think the answer to that is yes, if we have spare capacity. I mean, I think that's the bottom line on that. That's what they're there for. You can do that. But of course, we're balanced across that's why we invested in the coker to size it for our facilities across Europe. But the answer is, fundamentally yes, you could do that if you have capacity.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Thank you, Paul. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll take our last question from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen.","Jason Gabelman","Yeah, hey. Thanks for taking my question a the end of the call. Firstly, we didn't touch on a couple of projects. The Mozambique LNG development and what's going on in Papua New Guinea. You did put in your press release that you still expect to sanction Mozambique at the end of this year, but there's been some reporting that you're looking at maybe changing who's doing the EPC on that project and I'm wondering if that could delay when you would sanction it? And then just any updates on what's going on at Papua New Guinea with negotiations with the government would be helpful. Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Sure, Jason. I think in Mozambique, we're still proceeding on the planning basis that we have for Area 4 and the two lines that we're going to put in Rovuma. There is likely to be at least we read there will be a change in ownership on Area 1, of course everyone reads that and Patrick made some comments and I think earlier on this week publicly that we have had some very, very preliminary discussions with Total to say, is there something more we can do to between Area 1 and Area4 to get the capital costs down.","That's a very, very early stage, because of course that ownership has not changed yet. But I think as Patrick said, if there's something there in the interest of both companies, so for sure we will look at that to improve the capital efficiency. But no change right now in our current planning basis. I think Patrick's comments were more talking about if something comes down the road then it's advantageous to both companies or both consortiums more Area 1 Area 4 than obviously we would look at it. But our planning base is to go ahead with what we've already communicated.","In terms of Papua New Guinea and the Papua LNG change of government there President, Marape is in power and I met with him about one month ago. And as he has publicly said and as petroleum minister has said they want to look at the legal aspects of Papua. Our understanding is they've had that review and they're discussing the outcome of that review now. As far as we're concerned, we have an agreement with the government. Prime Minister, Marape understands that.","And I don't see any change, but we'll have to wait and see what comes out of the government discussions. I have to say, Total is the operator on this block, so you really have to talk more details with them. As far as we're concerned, we have a contract and we honor our contracts and we anticipate no change in that agreement.","Jason Gabelman","Thanks. If I could just ask a question another one about chem. I know it's been covered pretty in depth today, but a peer had mentioned that they're seeing destocking in the China Chemical landscape in terms of inventory and there's been discussions kind of about an emerging naphtha oversupply. And I was just wondering if you're seeing one China kind of tapering back its feedstock costs per purchases? And if that is reverberating through the supply chain particularly for naphtha? Thanks.","Neil Chapman","Just to make sure I understand Jason. You're talking about destocking of polyethylene?","Jason Gabelman","No. So kind of not buying as much feedstock cost for their naphtha crackers and the inventory on hand.","Neil Chapman","I think it's pretty typical in a commodity business. People raise their inventory levels and reduce their inventory levels. Sometimes people speculate in terms of where they think prices are going and margins are going that's typically why people do that. I don't know if in China there's a destocking and folks believe that there is going to be some change in naphtha price. Naphtha is driven by of course fundamentally by expectation on crude oil price, but also the differential between naphtha and crude is driven by the supply\/demand of naphtha.","So I really -- I hate to speculate on why they're destocking. I think what you have seen in the markets over the last 12 months is relatively low naphtha prices versus crude oil. And I think that's primarily driven by this it is more like crude is on the market which leads to more condensate, which leads to more naphtha. And so you're seeing a trend in that over recent months. But I think it would be to speculate on short-term destocking in China I don't think I can add anything to that. Neil?","Jason Gabelman","Thanks.","Neil Hansen","Thank you. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight the second quarter that concluded. Again, excellent progress in the Permian and the achievement of a number of key milestones across our portfolio. I appreciate your continued interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation."],"8941":["Exxon Mobil Corp.

Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.","Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation.","Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher feed and energy costs.","Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide five, as indicated, ExxonMobil's second-quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion.","The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion.","Moving now on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from the year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide eight, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from the year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million. And all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable one-time impact from the Alberta tax increase, and favorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of field decline and downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including field decline, downtime, and divestment impacts.","Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11, Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime, reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales, and less favorable tax items.","Moving now to slide 12, sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand.","So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced margins by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million.","Turning to slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs.","Moving now to Chemical results, starting on slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.","Moving to slide 16, sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and an increase of maintenance activity.","The next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation is advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage.","Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%. We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup.","To build on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire InterOil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered undeveloped Elk-Antelope field and is payable above 6.2 trillion cubic feet, up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet. Finally, the agreement is subject to InterOil shareholder approval and the other customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews.","This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to six additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk-Antelope complements our existing discovered undeveloped resources, such as P'nyang, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea. And we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow this successful business.","Moving now to slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities, where we are advancing several attractive new investment opportunities, ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major projects startups in 2016 and 2017, of which four have already initiated production.","As shown in the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador, where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late 2017 startup.","In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. Eight drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018.","ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the Tengiz Expansion Project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in Tengizchevroil, the operator of the field.","Now in offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same high-porosity sandstone reservoirs we saw in the Liza-1 discovery well.","ExxonMobil along with its partners is progressing development planning activities on an early production concept involving a floating production, storage, and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. A final investment decision [FID] will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, regulatory approvals, and market conditions.","On July 17, we began drilling the Skipjack prospect, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest of the Liza-1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stabroek Block.","In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with The Ratio Companies to acquire a 50% interest in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana and will become the operator. Kaieteur is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra-deepwater north and adjacent to the Stabroek and Canje blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the three blocks.","Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operated portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids. We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies, and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions.","With longer lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion costs, this high recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development costs over the past two years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken. Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating costs to approximately $8 per barrel.","As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the Permian drill-well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drill-well locations in the Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drill-well inventory equates to nine years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And, as you can see on the chart, our economic drill-well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve.","Turning to slide 20 and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China.","In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction, and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced metallocene catalyst technology, process research, and applications expertise.","ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of our Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer, and industrial segments.","Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low-sulfur diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane.","The corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with SABIC to build a world-scale ethylene cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. SABIC and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomers project at our Kemya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers.","Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and, together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle.","And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business.","Moving to slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At midyear, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business.","Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil crude barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses.","And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and now I'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","A few of your competitors have publicly committed to new capital management plans and performance metrics by which they plan to be held accountable in the future. And on this point, ExxonMobil is typically focused on industry-leading returns across the business mix, I think is the way that Rex [Tillerson] phrases it. And the company has clearly been successful in that area. But my question is whether that objective may require revision when you consider that none of your peers were able to earn their cost of capital, even with Brent near $100 in 2014. So we're in a little bit of a different scenario these days, and I wanted to see if there was an update on how the company may be thinking about capital management plans, performance metrics, et cetera, in light of these circumstances?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, I think nothing has changed in our strategy, Doug. I mean, we fundamentally keep focused on maximizing shareholder value and have always been and will continue to be measuring that based on a return on capital employed. As we have talked previously, Doug, I mean, the focus is on value. Our decisions are based on the value choices that we make. Now if we get additional volumes growth or we get additional market share in those choices, well, that makes it even better. But there's no change, we continue to lead on return on capital employed, and we maintain focus on the business fundamentals.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. And I also wanted to ask a question about refined products demand. Specifically, your refinery throughput and your sales declined about 6% year-over-year, but there were changes to the portfolio along the way. So my question is whether or not there was anything unusual about that data point just because it is minus 6% besides the portfolio factors? And also what you guys are seeing in refined products demand around the world?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Let me start with the second part of the question. And as you know, demand has been generally strong from gasoline products, and distillate demand is growing, but the issue that we're all faced with right now are very large inventories of products at this point. The way we'll manage that is like we always manage it. We've got to be the most competitive refiner in the Chemical business out there, and we'll continue to focus on the key elements to achieve that objective.","In terms of the quarter-on-quarter performance, in terms of volumes, it's primarily due to plant maintenance activity.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Jeff, the year-over-year, first half versus first half, is it the same answer that it was really related to the changes in portfolio and turnarounds? Is that the way to think about it?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Exactly.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay, okay, thanks a lot","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question will come from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My first question is on Guyana. It's clearly a large discovery. Can you share any preliminary thinking on development concepts, when volumes might be realized, whether there would be an earlier full production system? Is Kizomba B a good template here, and thoughts on adding a second rig?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I certainly appreciate and understand all the interest in Guyana. We're very excited by it, as we talked in the past. We're integrating the data that we're picking up from the drill wells and the seismic analysis real time. You can appreciate there's a good effort around development planning. And as I said in the prepared comments, the current plan right now is an early production concept as an initial start. It's probably too early to discuss too much of those details. Clearly, there has been some initial work that we've done for regulatory purposes. But as I said, we have a lot of work to do, and we'll continue to manage it.","When you think about things like bringing in a second rig, that will be a function of a lot of issues. And when you do something like that, Evan, you want to make sure that you've got a really good understanding of what your prospects look like, and you understand the dependencies on them. You don't want to outrun your headlights on it. Good success so far, we're encouraged about the growth in Guyana and the development capability, but we want to manage this in the most effective way to make sure we maximize the value.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's fair. And my second question is another Tier 1 asset here. The InterOil transaction really has unique value to Exxon due to the PNG LNG brownfield expansion and the economics. Maybe more on the macro, what is your outlook on the LNG markets, and does the potential for multi-train expansions in PNG reduce your appetite for LNG development elsewhere over the next several years? Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Evan, I'd say let's start with our energy outlook. And it starts with our forecast that gas is going to grow about 1.6% per year from 2014 to 2040. And LNG will triple over that time period from today's capacity. So that really sets up the business case for us. Now, like any type of commodity, there are going to be periods of oversupply and periods of shortness, and we do expect that into the early part of the next decade that there will be some oversupply. But we keep focused on the long-term value proposition. And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices.","Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability. So I think the organization sees that as a very significant opportunity moving forward. Broadly speaking, as you've heard, we've got a number of LNG projects that are in our development planning stages that we think are going to compete for that long-term LNG demand growth.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. How are you today?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Doug. How are you?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, thanks. I guess can I start with a follow-up please on Evan's question? I guess I'd like to switch to the additional exploration activity. I'm just wondering. I realize exploration is what it is. But to the extent you can share any thoughts on risk profile, how you've chosen the next exploration targets because previously that's (30:17), and that seems to have been pushed back in favor of Skipjack. So what is the read-through? What is your go-forward plan, and is there anything on risk profile you can share from the read-through from Liza (30:30)?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Doug, just to clarify, you are talking about just Guyana right now, right?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, sir, yes.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","As I said in my prepared comments, we're drilling the Skipjack prospect. It is testing a similar play to Liza, with comparable resource potential. Clearly, Liza helped to derisk a new play in a new basin. But as you know, all exploration wells do carry inherent risk. We do have a lineup of other prospects in the block. As I said, we've added two additional blocks, one that's got a seismic survey in progress and the next one in which we anticipate once the deal is concluded that we will do the same there. And that will continue to be fed into our list of options, and we'll decide what the next best opportunity is to pursue after Skipjack. But right now, the plan is that the rig will move from Skipjack back to Liza for another appraisal well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's terrific. Jeff, if I may just add on this a bit, I think Mark [Albers] had suggested that you did [indiscernible] (31:45) indicators across the whole block. Would Skipjack qualify under that category?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I'd tell you that the seismic images are similar to Liza, and probably that's where I'll end.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. My follow-up, a quick one, is M&A. Last down cycle, you guys obviously were very active. This down cycle is more asset focused with InterOil, it would seem. What are your thoughts on where the other basins (32:15), things that you could see opportunity? Of course, top of mind is Rex's recent visit to (32:21) and Mozambique.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Really nothing. I'd say from an acquisition standpoint that it's business as normal. We continue to stay very alert to the value propositions across our portfolio. We're not really focusing on a specific geography or resource type. But it's got to meet the fundamental quality expectations we shared previously, and that is it's got to compete with the resources we've got in our existing inventory. And we've got to have confidence that we can bring value to it and that it's got long-term strategic value that's going to be accretive to our returns. As you know, we've got the financial flexibility to do a number of things, and acquisitions is one of those things.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Would you care to address the press speculation in Mozambique?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Doug, I really can't comment on any market speculation.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'll leave it there, Jeff. I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff. How are you?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Sam. How are you?","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good, thanks. I just wanted to actually follow up on the LNG outlook question. I'm not going to ask you to front-run your 2017 long-term market outlook, but one of the things that other operators are saying is that one of the big challenges in sanctioning LNG projects is that it's difficult to find buyers right now. But it seems like if LNG prices are structurally lower into the long term, maybe demand could accelerate perhaps faster than what the view was one or two years ago. And I was just wondering if you're seeing anything, if you have spot market exposure, if there seems to be increased penetration of LNG in some markets that you hadn't seen before, and if it was a function of price?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I'd say that certainly there are a lot of players in the LNG market now. But I would also say we have built a very credible reputation with the buyers. We delivered our projects on time, on schedule. We have an exceptional operations center that has been very effective in managing the contracts that are in place. So we've got a really good relationship out there with the buyers. We've got a good feeling on where there are market developments. And you understand that the approach that we take, these are multibillion-dollar developments, and we by and large are going to fund those based on long-term firm commitments. And that's how we manage these investments to ensure that we get an attractive return on such a large commitment.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks for the color, and then just a quick bookkeeping question, if I can. As you know, there's a lot of focus from investors on quarter-to-quarter sources and uses of cash. I was just looking at this working capital draw, and if we could get a little color on that, if it's going to reverse or maybe what was behind that.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","So the working capital had a $2 billion impact, and it really is a function of many different variables in it. But I'll pull out that one is a pension contribution that we had detailed in our 10-K this year, and then the second being just normal account \u2013 changes in account balances between receivables and payables.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks so much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a quick one on Guyana. You were very successful in Angola with the early production. Could you be producing within a couple of years, do you think, as soon as 2018?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","What we were laying out in our permitting activity is probably early into the next decade at this point. There's a lot to consider to make sure that we are maximizing the value for the resource owner and for the co-ventures.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood, Jeff. Thank you. Secondly, the PNG, would that be for your own \u2013 would the InterOil deal be for your own facility, or are you intending to continue with the second development?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, that's a good question, Paul. Clearly, that's a topic for discussion amongst the co-ventures when we bring it together. You remember, as I said in my prepared comments, that we've got our already established discovered undeveloped resources that we've been working on in order to underpin an expansion to the existing PNG facility. The Elk-Antelope assets obviously are an attractive add. When the deal is closed, it's a matter of discussion amongst the co-ventures and the government parties to agree what the best value proposition is for how we develop that. And I think there's a strong case to say that it's going to go through our existing facilities.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, that's very helpful. Jeff, finally the cash flows of the quarter. Was there any major distortions in terms of the operating cash flows that we should think about? And can you remind me, do you have a sensitivity of cash flow to a dollar change in the oil price? Obviously, the concern here is that for the quarter, cash flows are falling short of your combined CapEx and dividend. I know your guidance is for flat volumes. I assume you're spending at a level to achieve flat volumes. My worry is that maybe we need to see a much higher oil price, I'm thinking more like $60 a barrel to balance this cash flow versus CapEx versus dividend. Can you give us a sense of how the cash flows would move? And if there was any particular distortion in the quarter? Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, sure, Paul. I mean, there was no specific distortion in the quarter. I will say that, if you recall in the Analyst Presentation, we did provide you a perspective of cash flow neutrality. In there, if you recall, we used a range of $40 to $80 per barrel, and felt like we were very well positioned to achieve cash flow neutrality by next year. I think the organization is making some really good progress in reducing our costs and making sure that they're all focused on creating incremental margin.","Your comment about price impacts on cash flow, we do provide in the 10-K some pricing sensitivities on earnings that you may want to go ahead and look at.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I will indeed. And, Jeff, sorry, I've had a follow-up request from a client to ask you why is CapEx trending well below the full-year guidance. Right.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","So our CapEx guidance, as you all know, just over $23 billion. Year-to-date, we are trending below, and it's driven by a number of factors. One is the organization remains focused on capital efficiency. We're still capturing market savings. Importantly, we continue to execute our projects very well. We're not seeing major budget overruns or extension to the schedules, and that's an important deliverable. And then there are still opportunities to go ahead and delay some of our resource investments that in this down market we can restructure them to capture additional value. So those factors are what I would summarize as the shortfall year-to-date.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, Jeff. Have a good weekend.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","You too, Paul.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I was curious if you could go into the impact from the Canadian wildfires and also the impacts in Nigeria, what kind of volume loss you had during the quarter? And also, I assume the Canadian wildfires are no longer having a substantial impact, but maybe the outlook in Nigeria?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, sure, Brad. Well, I mean, for the quarter, it was about 100,000 barrel a day impact combined. The Canadian wildfires, I mean as you know, they're not impacting our assets directly, but we went ahead and shut down out of safety for our organization. This time of year we watch it very closely, but for the most part, we think it is behind us.","Nigeria, you may recall that we did declare a force majeure in May for a period of time, and that resulted from a third-party operator that had an operational instance while they were towing a drill rig that, unfortunately, sat down on one of our pipelines. So we had to shut in the facility to help them remove that rig and then investigate the impact. More recently here in July, we had another force majeure. We picked up a system anomaly on the offshore export pipeline and have had some initial investigation. And we believe it was damaged due to a third-party impact. And we're working with the joint venture partner and our government authorities to investigate how to rectify that at this point.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then I was curious if you could also talk a little bit about the new petrochemicals plant that you're investigating on the Gulf Coast. Just thinking about there are a lot of plants in queue ahead of you presumably before that would come online. So how do you think about the supply and demand dynamics of that?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, really good question, Brad. Let me start again with our energy outlook. We see chemicals demand growing about 1% above GDP between now and 2040. Over the next decade, we see that ethylene demand will grow about 4% per year, and that translates into capacity additions of about 6 million to 7 million tons per annum, per year, of additional capacity. So you can think of that as maybe four to five world-scale crackers per year. So once again, our outlook will inform our business strategy and our investment choices, and we see this as a really good opportunity.","Remember that we've currently got a project underway in Baytown to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity and a corresponding project in Mont Belvieu to add derivative units to take it to polyethylene, in fact, metallocene polyethylene. This project would look at another world-scale cracker of about 1.8 million tons per year of ethylene. And that would feed, at this stage still early, would feed a monoethylene glycol plant and two polyethylene plants.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that color.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi there. Just coming back to the gas theme, obviously you had Paris on the CO2 side. You've got a very bullish forecast on LNG demand. I mean, is this a general shift towards gas? I noticed you're sort of 60% oil, and it would have been even higher in the quarter with Nigeria and Canada. Or is this just knowing the assets just an opportunity to just get hydrocarbon at the low end of the gas cost chain?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No, Ed. It's not a shift in our strategy in any way. We've been very consistent in it. It's a recognition of opportunities that we see across the globe in both the crude as well as gas. And again, I'll go back to my value theme. It's where we think we can maximize shareholder value.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then on U.S. gas price, I mean obviously there's a lot of noise about spot LNG prices and contract renegotiation, but obviously, there are time lags in the contracts as well, so you would have expected the gas price to probably go down a little bit. But anything funny that you're seeing in terms of the gas prices across your non-U.S. portfolio?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No, not really. As you recall, crude prices got to a low level in the first quarter of this year. There is a lag effect on the contracts. We've got many different contracts. It's hard to imply that there's a standard that you can use to calculate the impact. But generally, you can see a crude lag impact of anywhere from three to six months.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, cool. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you, Ed.","Operator","And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Jeff, just wanted to follow up on the first question in terms of refining margins. And you guys have a unique perspective on this given the amount of capacity that you touch. Do you think the weakness that we've seen year over year in refining margins and versus the five-year average is a function of global demand? Or of refining capacity and utilization? And then how do you see it playing out over the longer-term?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No, I think it's probably the latter. It's probably refining capacity and then, as you know, inventory build. So I mean, with very strong demand in 2015, good demand in 2016, I think the sector was ready for the demand moving into 2016. And you've seen that in the inventory builds. And going forward, just like any supply\/demand fundamental, either the demand's got to grow or the supply's got to shrink, and you'll see the same type of fundamentals going forward. Our focus will be one of \u2013 again, as I said earlier, it will be making sure that we're the most competitive refiner out there.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","As you think about it geographically, which regions do you think will have to rationalize runs as you think about your competitor portfolios, to the extent margins do continue to weaken?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I'm not going to speculate on capacity utilization. Rationalization, we've said for some time, we expect to see across the globe, particularly in places like Europe and Asia.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great, Jeff. And the follow-up question on M&A here is I think in Rex's remarks at the Analyst Day, he had pointed to valuations from Exxon's perspective of U.S. E&Ps were challenging and the bid\/ask spreads aren't there. If you could talk about the opportunities set as you think about M&A in the Lower 48, that would be helpful.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","As you can appreciate, Neil, the bid\/ask is really a function of many factors, including the business climate and for us the unique ability for us to add value to it. There has been a pickup, a slight pickup. The longer that prices stay in this area code, probably the more ability to come to a win-win agreement. As I said earlier, Neil, really it's keeping focused on the full breadth of opportunities and trying to identify where we can come to a win-win solution that adds value for the long term.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you, Neil.","Operator","And our next question will come for Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could just ask the first one on capital priority, do you have any rough priorities in terms of the use of cash as the commodity recovers in terms of balance sheet versus capital acceleration versus shareholder return? Is there a point that you look to get back to before thinking about restarting the share buyback program?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No. If you go back to our capital allocation approach, it's all about making sure that we provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time continue to invest in accretive assets. The buyback program has been the flexible part of the program. As we've talked previously, the buyback program is considered on a quarterly basis. And it also considers things like the company's current financial position, our investment requirements, as well as the near-term business outlook. We'll make those determinations on buyback on a quarterly basis.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And in terms of debt reduction on that as well, are you at a place where you'd like to reduce absolute levels of debt, or are you fairly comfortable with where you are right now for this point in the cycle?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I think given where we are in the cycle, we've got significant debt capacity that we can leverage. Paying down debt is obviously one of those things that we will consider as we move forward. But we've got a very strong balance sheet. We're going to maintain our prudent cash management and we're going to invest wisely. But at the same time, we're not going to forgo attractive opportunities. And I think you've seen that here, as we talked this morning in the prepared comments.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And maybe if I could shift one to the U.S. onshore, we appreciated the slide that you had in there with some details on the Permian and the Bakken. Could you say how many rigs you're running right now in the U.S. onshore currently? And how should we expect to see you manage that heading into 2017? Are you at the point where you're thinking about moderately accelerating?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","So right now we're running \u2013 for the second quarter we were running 11 rigs in total. Now we're down to about 10.","In terms of going forward, we want to be mindful of a number of factors. We generally manage this with a very measured pace considering a number of factors that would drive how aggressive we want to be in the near-term. You heard me say in the prepared comments that one of those things are the market conditions, but also resource maturity, learning curve benefits you saw in the prepared comments, the significant benefits we continue to realize in our Permian and Bakken drilling activities. We don't want to outrun the headlights and we don't want to miss some value opportunities. You need to have the right infrastructures in place. And then there's obviously considering the current supply\/demand balance. So we'll manage it as we go forward, depending on those factors.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from Asit Sen from CLSA Investments.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Asit.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","So thanks for the color on PNG, LNG. I just want to get a little deeper, please. If you were to add a train, a new train to the existing facility, how much resource gas do you really need to underpin a train? Is it still sort of a 5 Tcf number? And remind us of your resource footprint there. I think in your opening remark you said 4.1 million net acres. What is Exxon's resource footprint in the region?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, I guess on the first one is, the resource required for a train is really a function of how big we build that train, and that's part of the development planning that we're going through at this stage. As you heard me say earlier, the two existing trains have a combined capacity of 6.9 million tons per annum.","In terms of our total acreage, I don't have a number to share with you at this point. I mean, the IOC deal, as I said in my prepared comments, adds 4 million acres.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","And then shifting gears to International Downstream, Jeff, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the current trends in Asia given emergence of Chinese teapot refineries? Did you see anything incrementally new in the first half of 2016? Are you seeing anything different? Or is it business as usual?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I'd say the latter, business as usual.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thanks, Asit.","Operator","And our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to ask a clarification on Paul's CapEx question. You're talking about costs trending well. Is there any specific reason that you wouldn't have lowered the full-year guidance for CapEx? Are there specific projects or things you're thinking about for the back half that would have it trending upward from a pretty consistent rate in the first half?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Well, I mean, Phil, we really provide guidance at the beginning of the year. Unless there's something materially different in our plans, we really don't change that guidance. Now the organization will obviously continue to manage it in the most effective way. If there are opportunities that come up on the horizon, we'll judge it against the value proposition and not be constrained if we think it's the right decision for the company. As I said, having said that, we do expect a downward vector.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, okay, fair enough. You did lower it last year, I think midyear, so that's why I was asking. I guess I'll ask one final question on the second quarter. Just given the magnitude of the miss, you usually don't miss by this much, looking back over the past five or 10 years. So if I take maybe the LNG lag effects or gas pricing, the effect of the production, up 1,000 barrels a day, do you have any rough sense of maybe what one-time factors from an earnings standpoint hit you in the quarter?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, well, I mean, I would summarize it on the Upstream side, it's primarily driven by three components: one were gas realizations; two were the non-reoccurring events; and then three would be the downtime that we talked about previously, particularly in Nigeria and Canada.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any way to quantify it?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Nothing more than what we've shared in the prepared information.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Getting kind of late in the call, but I guess the question I'd ask, kind of getting to the, call it M&A or investment options as you look internationally. So you've announced the InterOil transaction. There's been \u2013 and I know you won't comment on rumors, but there have been rumors out there about moving more aggressively into Iraq, potentially Mozambique. Does any of this reflect an improvement in sort of I don't know if you call it a bid\/ask spread on some of these big global projects, but maybe a view internally that things are at least looking a little more stable or that sellers are starting to be more reasonable about what they're requesting?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I mean, I guess nothing's really changed in how we consider acquisitions, as I said earlier. We'll continue to scan the opportunities, and some of these things come and go and they come back again, so they take a while to transact. And if it competes with our existing inventory investments, it's something that we're interested in. It's something that we want to try to progress and make a deal on. By and large, I do think, Roger, that resource owners do recognize ExxonMobil's capabilities. And I think that, particularly in a down cycle where the resource owner is trying to attract investors, I think that plays well for us.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah, okay. I can certainly understand that. And then just a last question that hasn't come up in a while, but Argentina and the shale opportunity down there, any updates worth mentioning?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yeah, so you may have seen that we had announced a pilot for the Vaca Muerta in the Bajo del Choique and La Invernada block. It's a five-well pilot that we're progressing. It's underpinned by the December approval of a 35-year unconventional exploitation concession that we were able to secure. And the pilot will then allow us to better assess the full acreage potential. So good progress; it looks very promising. And you may have also picked up that we've got our XTO organization stirring (1:00:07) that asset as well to bring the U.S. knowledge and expertise into Argentina.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I did. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Thank you, Roger.","Operator","And our next question will come from Anish Kapadia with TPH.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi, good afternoon.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Good morning to you. I have a question going back to the InterOil deal again. I just wanted to understand why you chose to use equity, use your shares rather than cash for the deal. Just wondering if it's to do with balance sheet constraints, and especially as I think you're likely to get a significant amount of cash in from Total from milestone payments.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Anish, don't read too much into it. We have flexibility to do either, stock or cash. As you would expect, the final structure of a transaction is really a function of the dialogue between the seller and the buyer. And obviously, we keep focused on what the seller's needs are. But again, I wouldn't read too much into it. There are no balance sheet constraints with ExxonMobil.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay. And my follow-up question is on your U.S. gas production. We've seen some steep declines in U.S. gas production previously, and it seems to have moderated some more recently. I'm just wondering if you can give some idea of how you see that trending over the next few years and in the current gas price environment.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","If you recall, we are the largest gas producer in the U.S. We've got a substantial resource base that underpins that and a significant amount of development opportunities. If you think about the recent period, there has been \u2013 to be very transparent, we've had a much stronger focus on development of liquids opportunities, less so on gas.","Longer term, we think about that gas resource base in a number of ways. One, as I said earlier, we expect gas to grow globally at 1.6% per year. So we expect in the U.S. is that gas will underpin increases in domestic use, and you've seen how gas has continued to grow in power generation, as an example. Two, we see that gas helping to underpin some of these petrochemical investments that we've been talking about like the investment we've got in Baytown and even the one we're considering with SABIC. And then three, that gas also underpins our ability to compete in the global LNG market and our anticipated increases in demand.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Do you have the same seismic signatures?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Yes, we do, John.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, great. Next one, you said China stabilization. Can you be a little bit more specific? And that's it for me, thanks.","Jeffrey J.

Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","We're just looking at the quarter-on-quarter change in GDP, and by in large, it's been fairly stable. Fourth quarter of 2015 was about 6.8%. It's been on a gradual decline. First quarter of 2016 is 6.7%, and then it's estimated to be about the same level in the second quarter.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","I'll just add on China, John.

Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Three quick questions. You mentioned that now you have 10 rigs in the U.S. Can you tell us what is the number of rigs you need to maintain flat production in the Permian and Bakken?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Paul, we really don't think about it as how many rigs we need to keep production flat. We really think about it from a full global portfolio perspective. And as I said earlier a couple times, we've been very focused on maximizing value. And on the short-cycle investments, one of the things we've got to think about is the supply\/demand mechanics. So we really don't think about it from keep volumes flat. We think about how do we maximize value.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I fully understand. I'm not saying that Exxon thinks about that, but it's for our own benefit that in terms from an industry standpoint. So I'm wondering if there's a number that you can share.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No, there isn't because we don't work it that way.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Secondly, in page 11 of your presentation, hopefully you talk about asset sales gain and tax benefits different between first and second quarter. We saw the difference in earnings. Can you tell us what is the actual sales gain and the actual tax benefit in the Upstream during first quarter, and also in the second quarter?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","So you're asking for the quarter-on-quarter earnings?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","No, I'm talking about the actual asset sales gain you report in the first quarter and in the second quarter for Upstream. And also what is the tax benefit you record in the first quarter and also the second quarter in Upstream?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","From an earnings asset perspective, in the first quarter it was about $80 million total positive. And in the second quarter it was immaterial. It was a negative $20 million in the second quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, tax benefit?","Jeffrey J.

And final one, in M&A you mentioned that in order for you to go into a major concession, you need to ask the question, what do you bring to the table. Should we interpret that means that either once you applied whatever is the asset or what ownership, you will be the operator, or that you will be able to convince the consortium to move those assets into your own development site (1:07:23), like you may be able to do in Papua New Guinea? Should those be an important principle when you consider?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Those are certainly key considerations when we consider opportunities on the acquisition front.","Paul Y.

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys, just one question for me. About a month ago Exxon was in the headlines stating its preference for carbon tax and then the selection fees, and I wanted to ask. Within Exxon's project economic planning, do you incorporate a future carbon price? And if not, what would you need to see before you would include that factor in your planning?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary","Pavel, if you look in our energy outlook, which we've got posted on our company website, you'll see that we've included now for many years what we call a proxy cost of carbon. And over the outlook period out to 2040, that number grows as high as $80 per ton. But you'll see it in our energy outlook if you go ahead and take a look at it.","Pavel S.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you. Morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is Jack Williams. Jack is a Senior Vice President with responsibility for the Downstream and Chemical business lines.","As we'll discuss on the call today, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. It was a quarter highlighted by strong operating performance, significant growth in liquids production, and considerable value from our integrated business model. As a result, we delivered the highest level of cash flow from operating activities since 2014.","In addition, we completed several advantaged projects and made significant progress on investments that will generate long-term accretive value for our shareholders.","After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Jack will provide his perspectives on third quarter results and give an update on several key investments and strategic focus areas. Jack and I will be happy to take your questions following our prepared remarks.","Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation.","I'll move now to slide 3, which summarizes a number of developments that influenced our third quarter performance. As I mentioned previously, cash flow from operating activities was the highest it's been in four years, dating back to the third quarter of 2014.","Corporate charges for the quarter were outside the $700 million to $900 million range that we typically experience. This was due to net favorable absolute one-time items of $420 million, primarily related to tax. Now it's important to note that we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be at the high end of the normal range of $700 million to $900 million.","Crude oil prices increased slightly during the quarter, with Brent up $0.92 and WTI up $1.71. Permian tight oil production increased by 17% relative to the second quarter. We continue to ramp up drilling activities in the Permian, while also maximizing the value from our integrated midstream and manufacturing operations.","We had lower levels of downtime in the third quarter and stronger operating performance in Canada, where Kearl delivered quarterly record net production of 230,000 barrels per day.","We also achieved a number of significant milestones on long-term Upstream growth plans in Guyana and Brazil. Jack will discuss this a bit later in the call.","In the Downstream, tighter supply resulted in stronger fuels margins in Europe, while wider crude differentials contributed to improved margins in North America. We successfully leveraged our midstream logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities.","Improved utilization from lower scheduled maintenance and better reliability also contributed to stronger earnings in the quarter.","In line with our strategy to grow sales of higher-value products, we successfully started up a new hydrofiner at our Beaumont, Texas, facility and a delayed coker at our Antwerp refinery. The hydrofiner will increase production of ultra-low sulfur fuels by 45,000 barrels per day, using a proprietary catalyst that will remove sulfur, while minimizing octane loss. The Antwerp delayed coker will increase supply of distillates and marine gas oil, further strengthening our Downstream portfolio ahead of IMO 2020.","The long-term demand fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business. We experienced weaker margins during the quarter. Improved realizations were more than offset by higher feedstock costs, primarily U.S. ethane. A significant scheduled turnaround at our Singapore facility also impacted quarterly results.","We continue to expand Chemical manufacturing on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This included start-up of the 1.5 million metric ton per year ethane cracker at our Baytown, Texas, chemical and refining complex.","Now moving to slide 4, which provides an overview of third quarter financial results. Third quarter earnings were $6.2 billion or $1.46 per share, up 57% from the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.6 billion, including a $1.5 billion in proceeds from asset sales.","Third quarter CapEx was $6.6 billion. We continue to progress investment to support our long-term growth plans, including increased activity in the Permian and the acquisition of additional acreage in Brazil.","CapEx through the first three quarters of the year was $18.1 billion. Now if you exclude the acquisition of incremental Brazil acreage of about $1 billion, we remain on pace to meet full-year guidance of approximately $24 billion.","Free cash flow after investments was $7.2 billion, more than enough to cover the $3.5 billion in dividends.","Debt ended the quarter at $40 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease compared to the second quarter. And as a result, we've reached the lowest level of debt that we've had since the end of 2015.","Cash increased to $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter. This increase, which was above our normal operating levels, due primarily to the timing of proceeds from the Germany retail divestment, which closed in the fourth quarter. So again, we received those proceeds the day before the quarter ended, and the transaction closed on October 1. We don't have the earnings impact in this quarter, but we did receive the cash.","I'll start the more detailed review of our third quarter results with a reconciliation of Upstream financial and operating performance. Slide 5 provides a look at Upstream results relative to the second quarter.","Liquids growth contributed to Upstream earnings of $4.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase. Gas prices increased by 7%. Crude realizations were essentially flat, impacted by wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials. However \u2013 and we look at this \u2013 the estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on our Upstream was $170 million, but given our integrated logistics and manufacturing position, that value and more was captured in the Downstream.","Having the takeaway capacity that we have that exceeds our Upstream production allows us to \u2013 allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit of approximately $280 million in the Downstream.","Lower scheduled downtime and the absence of impacts from the PNG earthquake increased Upstream earnings by $130 million. An increase in production, in addition to the volume recovery we saw from lower downtime, contributed $320 million to third quarter earnings. Other items included net absolute favorable one-time tax impacts of $370 million.","Now moving on to slide 6 and a comparison of third quarter Upstream production to the second quarter of this year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.8 million barrels per day, an increase of 139,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments, volumes were up 5% as a result of improved operations and a continued focus on growing volumes with the highest value.","Liquids increased 3%, driven by continued growth in the Permian and improved performance at Kearl. Natural gas production was up 5%, lower downtime across the LNG portfolio including Qatar, PNG, and Gorgon.","Moving to slide 7 and a comparison of third quarter Upstream earnings with the third quarter of 2017. Higher prices increased earnings by $2.6 billion, driven by a $19 per barrel or 41% improvement in crude realizations and a 30% increase in natural gas prices.","Again, we estimate the unfavorable impact of wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials on our Upstream results, in relative to last year, to be approximately $360 million. The total estimated benefit though that we captured in the Downstream from our fully-integrated value chain was $590 million compared to the third quarter of last year.","Downtime decreased earnings by $80 million. This was largely driven by carry over from the second quarter Syncrude outage. And just to give you an update, as of mid-September all cokers at Syncrude were back online.","Other volume impacts increased earnings by $130 million. Liquids growth, largely driven by U.S. unconventional and Hebron, was partly offset by the impact from lower entitlement volumes.","Slide 8 provides us a comparison of third quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year. Oil-equivalent production declined by approximately 90,000 barrels per day. However, and this is important, if you exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments, volumes increased by more than 60,000, with liquids production up 6%, including 57% growth in the Permian.","Gas decline year over year was mostly in U.S. unconventional, again, aligned with our focus on value and our near-term prioritization of liquids growth opportunities. Lower entitlements, resulting from higher prices, reduced volumes, as did continued efforts to high-grade our portfolio. And the largest impacts came from the divestments of our operated assets in Norway and a number of U.S. Rockies gas assets.","Increased downtime in the quarter was driven by carryover again of the second quarter unplanned outage at Syncrude.","Liquids growth more than offset decline from mature fields. This was led by the significant increase in unconventional Permian and Bakken production and the continued ramp-up at Hebron. Improved performance at Kearl also contributed to the increase in volumes.","Moving now to slide 9. I'll review Downstream third quarter financial and operating results, starting first with a comparison to the second quarter. Downstream earnings of $1.6 billion increased by $918 million, proved operations and the capture of significant value from our integrated business model.","Refining margin strengthened in North America supported by wider crude differentials and in Europe with tighter supply. Stronger margins contributed $150 million to earnings.","As previously mentioned, our integrated logistics network that allowed us to connect barrels in the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities enabled us to capture significant benefit from wider differentials. And we estimate the favorable impact to the Downstream to be approximately $280 million versus the previous quarter.","Lower levels of scheduled maintenance and improved reliability increased earnings by $460 million.","The absence of last quarter's unfavorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a positive $140 million contribution to earnings. But let me tell you, the absolute impact from foreign exchange on third quarter earnings was immaterial. In fact, it was about a $15 million help.","And then finally, other items included improved refining yield and mix and minor asset sales gains.","All right. Now moving to slide 10 and the comparison of current quarter Downstream earnings relative to the third quarter of the prior year. Downstream earnings for the quarter were up $110 million.","Margins had a negative impact on earnings of slightly more than $100 million. And this was mostly driven by lower lubricants and fuels margins in Europe and Asia Pacific. The absence of supply tightness that resulted from Hurricane Harvey last year also impacted our relative margins.","Now before I move on, let me give you some additional perspective on lubricants margins. With higher feedstock costs and softer market fundamentals for base stocks, the negative impact on third quarter earnings from lubricants margins was more than $200 million compared to last year. And then if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we've experienced approximately $500 million in downward pressure from lubricants margins.","This was partly offset again by our ability to successfully capture approximately $590 million of benefit across our value chain from wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials.","Downtime and maintenance resulted in a $10 million negative impact in quarter-over-quarter earnings. Higher maintenance activities were offset by the absence of the volume and expense impacts that resulted from Hurricane Harvey last year. Other items reflect the impacts of the lower U.S. tax rate, benefits from minor asset sales gains, and improved refining yield and mix.","Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 11, starting first with the comparison of the third quarter with the second quarter. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $713 million, a $177 million decrease. This was mainly driven by higher planned maintenance, partly offset by growth in sales of higher-value products.","Margins decreased by $20 million, as increased ethane prices impacted polyethylene margins. This was mostly offset though by stronger aromatics margins.","Sales volumes increased earnings by $40 million with higher polyethylene demand and contribution from our new assets in Singapore and the U.S.","Downtime and maintenance negatively impacted earnings by $140 million, mainly driven by planned turnaround activities in Singapore. The other items you see there included some unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Now turning now to slide 12 and a review of current quarter Chemical earnings relative to the third quarter of last year. Lower margins resulted in a decrease of $140 million; higher feed and energy costs outpacing stronger realizations.","Higher product sales improved earnings by $30 million, supported by an increase in sales from new assets. Downtime and maintenance had a negative impact of $90 million, and again this was driven by the Singapore turnaround. It was partly offset by the absence of last year's impacts from Hurricane Harvey.","Other items included operating expenses for the new assets and upcoming projects, as we continue to position our Chemical portfolio for long-term accretive growth. And unfavorable ForEx also had an impact on earnings.","Slide 13 provides a review of sources and uses of cash. Third quarter earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital, yielded $11.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities. Asset sales contributed $1.5 billion in the quarter, including proceeds with the previously mentioned Germany retail divestment, which again closed in the fourth quarter.","In line with our capital allocation strategy, cash flow from operations and asset sales fully funded year-to-date investments and shareholder distributions. We've also been able to reduce debt levels, further strengthening our industry-leading financial flexibility.","Cash used to fund investments and shareholder distributions in the third quarter were $5.4 billion and $3.5 billion respectively.","Our ending cash balance of $5.7 billion was up $2.3 billion from the prior quarter. And again this was driven primarily by the timing of asset sales proceeds.","At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. He will provide some additional perspectives on third quarter performance and discuss the progress we've made on the long-term growth strategy we outlined at the 2018 Analyst Meeting.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, thank you, Neil. I'm glad to be here today. And I'd like to thank all the folks on the line today for their interest in ExxonMobil. Let me make a couple of comments about the quarter. And then I'll go into some more updates on the strategic progress.","We're very pleased with the business progress that's reflected in the third quarter results. First, if you look at the Upstream, if you ex entitlements and divestments, the net positive volumes growth versus both sequential and year-ago quarters really bodes well, as it reflects the contribution from just one of the five key growth areas that we talked about back in March, and that's of course the Permian. I'd also add that the Hebron ramp-up contributed significantly as well, and it's also going very well.","In the Downstream, as Neil mentioned and quantified earlier, we're seeing the benefits of this integration across the value chain. And we're capturing value from low-cost crude feedstock that we purchased in Midland and Edmonton for our Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries. And that's enabled by the strong logistics position that we have.","And of course, in both the Upstream and the Downstream, we're very pleased with the improved reliability. This level of performance is much more in line with our ongoing expectations and has continued into October as well.","Now the Downstream did benefit from seasonally lower refinery turnaround activity. And in the fourth quarter you should see scheduled maintenance activity more in line with second quarter levels.","In the Chemicals business, we are seeing some near-term impacts of recent industry supply growth, including our own, which does not change our view of the long-term attractiveness of this business. The fundamentals continue to remain strong. Our growth plans remain on track. And that's evidenced by the recent start-up of the new Baytown steam cracker. So all in all, a good quarter.","So now let me cover a few slides to highlight some of the progress we're making in our Downstream and Chemical businesses.","I'll start with a reconnect in the Downstream. And what we talked about was the key driver for Downstream earnings growth is this yield shift to grow higher-value products. And that's largely through the deployment of our proprietary catalyst and process technology.","Now this yield shift is accomplished primarily through six advantaged refining projects. Three of these are in the near term, the Beaumont hydrofiner and Antwerp coker, both of which are now online, and then the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker, which should start up around year-end. And just for completeness, the other three are the Fawley hydrofiner, Beaumont light crude expansion, and the Singapore is the upgrade project.","So just a couple of comments on that. When I say advantaged, what I mean there is that either due to proprietary technology application or to integration benefits or both, these projects generate from mid-teens to mid-20s discounted cash flow returns.","And when I say primarily, in terms of primarily those six projects, those projects really are needle movers in that regard. But there's also a few hundred other smaller optimization projects that are collectively having a big impact as well. As a matter of fact, as you think about the 2018 and 2019 turnarounds, in over 80% of those, the scope includes work on these small optimization projects. And I think it's just really a great example of how our Downstream teams are continually working to improve the performance of our assets.","And the other main strategic area for us is this integration across the value chains. And in the Permian, we really have a unique position that's already generating additional value today.","We're progressing a very attractive pipe-still expansion at Beaumont. And we're further building our logistics position to capture the advantaged feeds on the Gulf Coast integrated facilities. I'll talk more about that logistics in a second.","On Beaumont, just a quick reminder on that project. We're adding a 250,000 barrel a day atmospheric pipe-still and some hydrotreating conversion capacity. But we're utilizing an existing gas plant and utility capacity. And we're replacing over 100,000 barrels a day of intermediate products that are purchased at Baytown and Baton Rouge.","So this project is highly attractive. You're essentially getting a large-scale capacity addition for the unit cost of a debottleneck project. So very, very attractive project. And it significantly improves the Beaumont complex earnings profile.","Okay moving on to Chemicals. In March we spoke of 13 new Chemicals manufacturing facilities, and these are all underpinned by these competitive advantages that we were talking about, integration, proprietary technology, performance products, and global market access. Seven of the 13 are now operational, with the steam cracker at Baytown that started up in early \u2013 early in the third quarter.","We're actively progressing projects to increase our Chemical product manufacturing capacity by 40%. So if I look forward, we have the Beaumont polyethylene expansion that should start up middle of next year. We're progressing a new ethane cracker in Corpus Christi. And we've recently announced a plan to pursue a new liquids cracker in China. I'll expand on these in a later slide, but I just want to leave you with the point that we're on track with our Chemicals growth plan.","So now for a couple of business updates. Start with the Antwerp delayed coker. This 50,000 barrel a day coker is now operational. And the point I want to make here is that it is located at Antwerp, but I want to stress that it's a regional coker. In other words, we're planning to process resids from our entire European circuit at this coker.","And you can see on the map that we're showing here that it's centrally located in the manufacturing center of northwest Europe, so we can process third-party resids as well.","At the time of FID on this project back in 2014, it was not clear when the IMO bumper fuel spec change was going to come into effect. But the project was attractive based on just trendline industry margins. And we knew the spec change provided potential upside. Of course, looking at the start-up timing today, it looks very likely we're going to achieve that upside, that additional upside.","Once we achieve stable operations on the coker, we'll be looking for debottleneck opportunities to further increase capacity in the unit. And typically we're able to get about another 10% or 15% of more throughput over time.","So this coker positions us well in Europe for the 2020 IMO spec change. But we're in good shape in the rest of the world as well, with the most global coking capacity of any of the IOCs.","And we're also going to offer a marine gas oil and a low sulfur fuel oil option for our customers. And of course, we'll continue to offer a high-sulfur fuel oil product to the ship owners who invested in onshore scrubbers.","Moving on to the Permian. We are positioned well in the Permian across the full value chain. It starts with the Upstream position, where we continue to see positive indicators on both the quality and the size of the resource in the northern Delaware Basin acreage.","You can see on the chart on the left that we're making good progress versus the growth potential communicated back in March. Our XTO Permian team is very excited with the results they're seeing out there in this new acreage. And the vector is clearly up on the Permian developments.","I was out there about a month ago. And in fact, the entire management committee and the board went out there. We even let Neil go out there with us. And the team, it was clear to see that the team was very energized. They're really starting to hit their stride. It was really good to see that operation. Still early days, but again, the vector is up there.","Today \u2013 looking more Downstream, today we have the ability to run 450,000 barrels a day of light crude in our Gulf Coast refining circuit. And this has provided ample incentive to secure efficient transportation capacity to our refineries well in excess of equity production from the Permian.","Currently, we have about 270,000 barrels a day of committed capacity. And that's likely going to grow further in the coming quarters.","And the 450,000 barrels a day is growing too. In addition to the Beaumont expansion, we're working on some other smaller debottleneck projects to add about another 50,000 barrels to ultimately take our Gulf Coast light crude processing capacity to over 750,000 barrels a day.","And then in addition to our three Gulf Coast integrated facilities, we run Permian crude at 10 other sites outside the U.S., including our Singapore crude cracker.","On the lower left of the chart is a chart from Mark (28:05) showing the integrated earnings based on 2017 prices and margins. Year to date with the actual environment we're seeing, we've made well over $1.2 billion across this value chain. And it's clear from the current environment, it's highlighting the value of our approach in the Permian.","So last thing I'd like to say is given the growth plans we have in both the Upstream and the Downstream here, we're progressing a large 1 million barrel a day plus crude pipeline system with our JV partners that's going to provide long-term efficient transportation to our Gulf Coast refineries and also other outlets. FID is planned for next year, will start-up in 2021. And we plan to be both an owner and an anchor shipper on the line.","Moving on to Western Canada. And our position across the full Western Canada crude value chain is somewhat similar to the Permian, with strong Upstream and Downstream positions that facilitate a development of a really valuable midstream logistics position that ensure we capture the full value of West Canada crude, even when there's a large WTI\/WCS differential.","And just to clarify here, when I say we and our on this slide, I'm also including IOL [Imperial Oil Limited]. All the assets in Western Canada are fully or partially owned by IOL, and they're of course operating everything up there.","Our Upstream position is comprised primarily of interest in Cold Lake, Syncrude, and Kearl. And this production is processed at the Strathcona and Sarnia refineries in Canada; our Midwest Joliet and Billings refineries; and then all of our three large U.S. Gulf Coast integrated facilities. And all of these with heavy oil processing capabilities.","During the early days of bringing Kearl on stream, we made the decision to invest in a 210,000 barrel a day capacity rail terminal in Edmonton. And that's to allow efficient unit rail transportation to the Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast in case Canadian production growth out-ramped pipeline capacity.","As you can imagine, the utilization of this terminal is increasing rapidly in this current pipeline constrained environment, which provides another transportation option down to the Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries, in addition to our committed pipeline capacity.","Today, we're running about 100,000 barrels a day through this terminal. That should grow to about 170,000 barrels a day by the first quarter of next year.","Our Downstream logistics positions in this value chain are unique, and like the Permian, added a significant earnings contribution in this quarter.","Moving to Chemicals. The chart on the left here was shown back in March. And it shows the market position of over 75% of our Chemical product sales, where we're either number one or number two in the market.","Our seven new facilities that are now online have added about five MTA of additional manufacturing capacity. And as shown in the red stars on the chart, they're focused on many of the products where we already have a leading market position.","We continue to progress a new 1.8 MTA ethane steam cracker along with ethylene glycol and two polyethylene derivative units at a site near Corpus Christi, Texas. Construction of that project is pending completion of the environmental permitting process. And expected start-up is in 2022.","In September, we announced an agreement to pursue a liquid steam cracker complex in China's Guangdong province to produce performance polyolefin products for the domestic Chinese market. The current plan is the unit will have a direct crude cracking capability similar to our Singapore operation.","And we're growing all these new facilities with a significant proportion of performance products, which currently are about 30% of our overall Chemical sales. They're growing at a rate of about double that of the commodity Chemical sales we're having. And they achieve, due to superior performance characteristics, on average about a 30% higher price than commodity products.","So now let me wrap up with sharing a few other highlights in our business that \u2013 milestones since the end of the second quarter.","In Brazil's fifth pre-salt bid round, we were the successful bidder on the Tit\u00e3 offshore block, adding up more than 71,000 net acres and bringing our offshore acreage build to about \u2013 well not to about \u2013 to precisely 26 blocks, two-thirds of which we're the operator.","In Guyana, we made our ninth offshore discovery and fourth year to date, the Hammerhead-1 well. This discovery reinforces the potential of the Guyana Basin. So as I think Neil highlighted last month, we've added a second exploration rig. In fact, I can verify that rig has now spudded the Pluma exploration well. And we're also fast-tracking the Liza Phase 1 development, so the vector is certainly looking up in Guyana.","Our Permian tight liquids production growth continued. It's up 57% quarter on quarter 2018 versus 2017. And we're currently running 38 rigs in the Delaware and Midland basins.","In Angola, the first Kaombo FPSO successfully started up in late July, with production expected to reach 115,000 barrels a day. And a second FPSO is planned to start up in mid-2019.","Moving to the Downstream. Our Indonesia lubricants acquisition is proceeding well. Transition with Federal (sic) [PT Federal Karyatama] (34:33) is on track. The expertise in motorcycle lubricants is complementing the mobile lubricants offer. And we think we're positioned well now to be a strong competitor in a growing market.","Mexico, our fuels market entry is progressing well. Recently, we've been streaming new sites at the rate of three new retail stations per week.","And in Germany, our retail divestment was completed October 1. So we're moving to our branded wholesale model there.","And the Augusta Refinery and Terminals divestment is on track for completion at year end. So if the Augusta sale does close in the fourth quarter, we expect a combined earnings benefit in the Downstream from both the Germany and the Augusta divestments of about $700 million to $1 billion with forex movements being one factor that could impact the final earnings.","And moving to Chemical. Start-up has commenced at our Newport, Wales, Santoprene specialty elastomer expansion project, with the first production line now in service and the second line planned for start-up in next year.","And our Beaumont polyethylene plant expansion that I mentioned earlier will take the remainder of the ethylene from the new Baytown cracker that's not going to Mont Belvieu. And that's progressing well, and the start-up is planned for mid-2019.","So before I hand it back to Neil for some \u2013 to start the Q&A, let me just wrap up by telling you that we're on track with our growth plans. We've seen a bit of upside in Guyana and in the Permian. And we've hit a couple of important milestones with the Antwerp coker and the Baytown steam cracker start-ups.","So I feel good about where our businesses are positioned today and the underlying path we're on. We are all excited about the opportunities in front of us. And I can assure you the organization is working very hard on it.","So with that, I'll hand it back to Neil.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Great. Thank you for the comments, Jack, and I do appreciate you letting me go on that Permian trip. It was wonderful.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No problem. No problem.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","All right. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Williams and Mr. Hansen.

Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, Jack and Neil, maybe you could start off by just talking about the LNG cadence of projects. You've got so many different options out there, whether that is Mozambique, Golden Pass, the potential upside of PNG, Qatar.","And I think we as an investor community are wondering what are the priorities in terms of most likely to sanction? When? And how should we think about the cadence of that growth? So if you'd just frame out how you're thinking about it and where you stand with some of the key projects, that would be helpful.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank, Neil. Let me start off, Neil, and you can chime in if you like.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","We are very happy with the portfolio of opportunities we have in the LNG market. At Papua New Guinea, we're building on success there with the foundation project that's continuing to achieve performance above expectations.","Mozambique, a big new area for us, large resource base. We think we're bringing some real unique expertise that we have from both PNG and in Qatar to bring to bear on that resource.","And then of course here in the U.S., continuing to look at Golden Pass with QP. And obviously, very interested in any expansions in the North Field as well.","So I would say that given the low cost of supply of all these opportunities, they're all attractive. We see a growing LNG demand that would certainly allow all those projects to go forward.","Naturally, the Mozambique is a little bit behind PNG in terms of the onshore trains, the offshore coil may make it a little quicker. But \u2013 and obviously in Qatar, with the new trains, we would like to pursue that as soon as possible. But that may be a little bit longer term as well.","So in terms of the cadence, what I'd tell you is that there's other parties involved in all of those. We find them all attractive. We're wanting to pursue them all in our typical capital efficient deliberate way. But very proud of where we are and the opportunities we have in front of us. And we're excited about pursuing all of them, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. The follow up I had is we've seen some increase in unconventional M&A. One of your peers doing a deal in the lower 48. And then some of the independents as well here over the course of the last week.","Just wanted your latest thoughts on pursuing growth in the lower 48, whether to do it organically? Or to do it through transactions? And just what the bid\/ask looks like in the market, especially with some of the shale players having a pullback here decently over the last couple months?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, yeah, thanks, Neil. You mentioned it earlier in your question. Let me just reinforce that, from an organic standpoint, we have a very exciting growth plan. We talked about that earlier. A lot of running room. We had that big acquisition, northern Delaware Basin, that we're now estimating over 5 billion barrels, 9 billion total in the basin. So a lot to go after there.","Having said that, we do maintain the financial strength to be able to capitalize on any environment we find ourselves in that might present an attractive opportunity. And we continue to scan the market for all opportunities that play to our strengths. We think certainly unconventional does that. So we're continuing to look.","I would say that as we think about those kinds of opportunities, we're certainly thinking about where we can really bring our development strengths. So something that would have a large undeveloped aspect to it.","But we do like our organic growth plan. We feel like that's going to give us a lot \u2013 many years of substantial growth. And as you may have noticed, our rig counts is increased in the Permian and the vector is up there. And so we got a lot to \u2013 a lot on our plate right now, but we continue to look.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Neil.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you, Neil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for calling on me.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","I guess my first question, I'm going to relay a question that I've been encountering in the investment community. And maybe you can have a better answer than I've been able to come up with.","But one of the fears that gets brought up occasionally is that fiscal terms internationally are sort of tightening. Renewals are challenging, especially with momentum in commodity prices. And people are afraid there's a lot of contracts that are scattered around the world that are sort of at risk. And that renewals aren't going to be as attractive.","Can you talk about how your unconventional business \u2013 if that's true, first of all? If it's not, you can just refute it. But if your unconventional business kind of functions as an offset to that, you can simply rotate capital into the U.S. where you're seeing those international headwinds? And whether there's sort of a limit to that strategy?","And just generally, if there's a strategic function to the U.S. unconventional business, besides just kind of short cycle volume growth at a high margin?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay. Sam, let me start with that and Neil may want to chime in. But on the last part of the question first, around the unconventional. I mean we do see it more than just kind of short cycle place to go invest.","We do view that whole unconventional strategically, and it really plays to our strength with the large unconventional organization that we have. So I would certainly characterize the U.S. unconventional as strategic and as a strength of our corporation.","Now getting back to the earlier part of your question around PSC extensions and terms and so forth. What I would say is that by the time PSC extensions come up, we typically had 20, 25, 30 years of operations. And we would hope \u2013 certainly our expectation, we would hope that the resource owner recognizes the strengths that we bring at that point in time. And that we are able to progress and extend, to the extent the resources are required, extend those terms, obviously with a fulsome negotiation.","So I wouldn't want to pre talk about where those things are going to go and when. But I would think \u2013 we typically start out with a position, start out from a position of strength in terms of what we've delivered in terms of the value to the resource. And that certainly comes into play in terms of those types of decisions.","The other thing I'd like to point out is in terms of this overall comment you made around fiscal starting to tighten and so forth, is when we talked about these five growth areas that we talked about back in March, think about when those were acquired and brought into our portfolio and the environment at the time. So we basically brought all those in kind of at the bottom of the cycle, where we had some \u2013 where the environment was reasonable in terms of getting reasonable terms and so forth. And all of those were tested hard at bottom-of-cycle conditions.","So to the extent that you think things are tightening now, it makes those resources and those projects all the more attractive. Neil, anything to add?","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, the only other thing, and maybe just to reiterate some of those points, Jack, we have a long history of execution. We have a good relationship with the resource owners. We tend to be a partner of choice. The diverse portfolio that Jack mentioned does give us that flexibility, Permian certainly being an example of that.","The only other thing I'd say is we've successfully renegotiated multiple extensions across our portfolio in the past. So I don't think there's any near-term pending concerns on fiscals. I think we continue to focus on making sure we deliver what we say we're going to deliver, that we establish those good relationships. And that certainly mitigates any of the risk you might have from deteriorating fiscals.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, thanks for all that color. And my follow up is quicker, just on this theme of integration. There's obviously a lot of focus on crude takeaway from the Permian and maybe from Western Canada too. But frac has been very tight in the Gulf Coast. And you sort of highlighted it with your Chemicals summary of the period.","But just how you think about the full suite of integration, besides just takeaway and refining. But maybe some of those intermediate stages too, if you have investment plans for that.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I can make a comment there. On the broader question of the takeaway capacities and these disconnects, the nice thing about being across the value chain is it doesn't really matter whether those disconnects are there or not in terms of the value we accrue to the corporation.","We'll \u2013 for instance in the Permian, we'll either accrue that value with higher crude price at the wellhead, or we'll accrue that value through our midstream and Downstream. But we'll get that full value of those molecules going all the way through the value chain to the customer. And really I think the same thing is true in Western Canada.","Now on the ethane issue and the NGL fractionation capacity. What I'd tell you on that is that that's a transitory issue. And there's more NGL fractionation capacity being built, constructed right now.","We certainly see that going away. We see plenty of ethane supply out there. And quite frankly, a lot of it's getting rejected into the methane stream right now. So that's going to get resolved. And I think it's going to get resolved in a matter of over the span of 2019. But I'd say that's more a transitory sort of issue. Neil?","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, I'll just reiterate. Long term fundamentals for the Chemical business remain very strong. We look at demand over time still growing at 1% above GDP. You'll see times where you'll see cyclical pressures. We don't try to attempt to time the \u2013 when we bring these investments online, we make these investments based on those long term fundamentals.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks so much.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. First area I wanted to just hit was on the Chemicals business, Jack. If we, I know there were some headwinds there from maintenance in the third quarter. But we have seen some pressure for much of the year on the earnings profile in the business. And it's a big area of investment for you guys. So maybe you could just elaborate a bit more on your thoughts here? And just in terms of the margin outlook for the various businesses?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Sure. Neil just mentioned, we do see a longer term growing demand, the fundamentals of the business still look good.","The issues have kind of shifted a bit. In the early part of the year, we had depressed aromatics margins. And those look much better now. And now with the U.S. ethane feedstock increases, it hurts the ethylene and polyethylene margins.","So there's a few kind of near term things going on. But it doesn't change the fundamental analysis for those supporting those big investments. We still see a growing market. We think our investments are all advantaged in terms of cost of supply.","We have these performance products that are unique to us that also enhance our projects as we bring them online. So as we look at the fundamentals, we really still like that business a lot and like the investments that we have made and are making.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Second question, just a quick numeric one would be, you had mentioned the two asset sales in Downstream and the earnings impact that you expect to see. What is the lost earnings impact from both of those assets on a go-forward basis? Because that's \u2013 you guys have a lot of asset sales. And I think that's the harder part for us to figure out sometimes.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Boy, I'm not sure what the lost value is going forward. Obviously, when we look at divesting assets, we do that when someone else sees more value for the asset than we do.","And so again the assumption is when we sell these divestments, we're getting more value out of them than we would if we were to keep them. But I don't have a specific number on those two individual assets on what we're giving up. But I can assure you that what we're getting today is worth more than what we would get if we were to keep them.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, I would agree on that. Yeah.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I could just ask one last one then.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Sure.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the cash flows, you had a headwind from deferred taxes. And I think in the first quarter, you had a big headwind from affiliates that you had expected to reverse at some point. Maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on where we would stand on that. Thanks.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, you're right. In the quarter, we did see an adjustment for the non-cash impacts from those favorable one-time tax items that I mentioned.","If you look full year, we will always see some timing on equity companies in terms of earnings and when the dividends come in. It's tough to predict when that will happen. I think we mentioned in the first quarter that that was the case. And we have seen dividends come in from equity companies.","I think another important thing to consider is these equity companies also may prioritize accretive investments over dividends. And so I think one of the things you're seeing and probably the biggest impact on a year-to-date basis is TCO. So TCO is the equity company that holds our Tengiz investment. And so obviously, they're prioritizing dividends over investing in that project.","So tough to predict exactly when the dividends come in. There will always be some timing impacts. But again, we've seen some cash come in. But we're certainly supportive of those companies continuing with investments that will provide value to the shareholders.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, hi. Good morning, everybody.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jack and Neil, I wonder if I could pick up, Jack, on one of your comments about fast-tracking Liza 1. I think originally \u2013 actually just a broader question on Guyana generally. Hammerhead, my understanding from your partners, could potentially also be fast-tracked in addition to Liza 1.","So I'm wondering if you can address where you see the guidance that you laid out for Guyana at your strategy update, versus to what appears to have been fairly rapid progress in the last six months.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, on Hammerhead, the rig just moved off there. We did some \u2013 in addition to drilling the well, we did some dynamic flow testing and so forth. So a little bit too early to provide any EUR estimates on that one. So I think that leaves us at this estimate that's out there right now of over 4 billion oil-equivalent barrels, up to 5 FPSOs, peaking at 750,000 barrels a day, with Liza 1 targeting early 2020 and Liza 2 coming in behind that. We're talking to the government right now about our development plan and environmental permit. Hope to start that one up in 2022 or behind that.","So we're continuing to tick on along. But when you look at the time between discovery and this projection of the Liza 1 start-up, it's very impressive in terms of what the industry timelines typically look like.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, Jack. Just to be clear. You did say fast-track, so has the March 2020 date changed for Liza 1?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, and I don't think we ever said March. We just said early 2020.","(54:52)","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Doug, when you go from five years from discovery to online, I view that as fast track. I mean that is very fast movement. That's about as good as it gets in industry. So that was why I took on fast track.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow up, guys, if I may is also \u2013 I'm afraid, Jack, it's also an Upstream question. Just going to the Permian, the 38 rigs, Q1 \u2013 or Q2 sorry, you gave us the completion cadence. You said you brought 50 wells online in Q2. Can you tell me what the \u2013 how that completion cadence looked in Q3? And what the \u2013 whether you've caught up now with your rig activity? Because obviously, it was still pretty light on the important completion pace. And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, and no need to apologize. I don't mind talking Upstream, and I don't mind talking Permian at all. I, in fact, enjoy talking Permian. Yeah, on the \u2013 let me answer your question directly, and then I'll expand it a bit.","We brought on 58 wells in the Midland Basin, and only eight in the Delaware Basin in the third quarter. And you'll notice the rigs are about equal between the two basins. And what you're seeing is that in the Midland Basin, there's a lot more infrastructure. We had the rigs there longer. And so the timing just worked out to where we have a lot more wells coming online there than the Delaware Basin.","Over time, some of that's going to switch over \u2013 some of that growth is going to switch over to the Delaware Basin, but it's just less mature. I think it points out the issue that I think that Neil Chapman said a couple times and I've said it as well. It's going to be fairly lumpy coming on. I mean we are basically doing three things. Our teams out in the Permian are doing three things simultaneously.","First, we're delineating this big new acreage position we have, and like I said, that everybody says, that looks very promising. There is further upward vector on that resource. We already increased it from 3 billion to 5 billion barrels. And there's further upward tailwinds on that.","We're building out infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. We're spending a lot of time and energy on this infrastructure build-out. There's about 200,000 barrels a day of well pad facilities under construction right now, in addition to two major central processing facilities.","So \u2013 but we had essentially a blank canvas on this 225,000 acres. There was not a lot of facilities out there. So we're building all that from scratch. Which in some respect is an advantage for us, because it allows us to bring other parts of our corporation, this major project expertise, to bear on this. And we're going to wind up with an infrastructure there that's really unlike anything else in the Delaware Basin or in the Midland Basin for that matter or any other unconventional development that I've ever seen. It's going to be very capital efficient and allow us long term to have a very competitively advantaged operation.","So \u2013 but in addition to those two things, we're also growing production. So they're also having some of the rigs dedicated to just developing where we know we have mature benches. And we feel like we know it pretty well, and we're just growing production.","But there's all those things going on at once. So it's going to be pretty lumpy. We draw a nice smooth line, but it's going to be pretty lumpy as we go up there but \u2013 as evidenced by this quarter. And...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jack, may I ask for a point of clarification real quick. I know I've got to jump off here. But Neil did promise a little bit more of a look-forward on some of your commentary. If you're 50 [wells] in Q2, 58 in Q3, can you give some idea as to what that's going to look like in Q4 in your current plan?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, I can't. I really don't know. I mean I can just tell you the rig activity we have out there \u2013 now I will say one thing. A lot of those rigs have been picked up in the last three, four, five months. And when you think about these multi-well pads that you drill four, five, six wells at a time and then have to come back and frac all those wells, all the facilities considerations and so forth, it's seven, eight, nine months between picking up a rig and having production online.","So it's coming. The activity is there. We're liking what we see. But I can't give you a number for fourth quarter.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And next we'll go to Thomas Kline with the Royal Bank of Canada.","Thomas Klein - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. With a good quarter and strong cash generation, I'm just wondering what else you guys would need to see, quantity, price or in terms of the environment, to prompt share buybacks? And especially in light of recent rhetoric on this from peers. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Great. Thank you, Thomas. Yeah, we did have really what was an excellent quarter from a cash generation perspective. We're very pleased with it.","I think nothing's changed for us in terms of our capital allocation strategy. And we're in a very fortunate position to have a really impressive portfolio of attractive accretive projects. And we're going to prioritize investing in those.","I think we talked about how the fact that in the Upstream, they're going to generate a 20% return and a 15% to 20% return in Downstream and Chemical. So that's certainly a priority.","We want to continue to pay a reliable, growing dividend. I think we've paid a growing dividend for 36 years now. And we recognize that those two things are tied together. We need to continue to invest in accretive projects, so we can continue to pay a reliable, growing dividend.","Now beyond that \u2013 and you've seen a little bit of it this year \u2013 we want to ensure that we have the financial capability, the financial strength that we need to take advantage of investment opportunities, regardless of the price cycle.","To the extent we can meet that, those objectives, and there's excess cash, we will certainly distribute cash back to shareholders. It's an important part of our capital allocation strategy. I think we've distributed more than $220 billion since the Exxon and Mobil merger, so it's certainly a key factor in that.","And I think if you look at it maybe bigger picture, what we're trying to do is we're trying to position the company for long term sustainable distribution to our shareholders.","I mean that's the objective. And we think the best way to do that is to ensure that we are taking advantage of, again, a portfolio of opportunities that's probably as attractive if not more attractive than anything we've seen since the Exxon and Mobil merger.","So we're not going to prioritize buybacks over doing that, because what we're really focused on is long term sustainable distributions. Anything to add to that?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I would just say that the shareholder accretion from this investment program we have is \u2013 we think is going to be very impressive. So I'd just echo that point. That we have a very exciting investment portfolio in front of us.","Thomas Klein - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks you. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Hey, thank you.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you very much, gentlemen. I appreciate the conversation around the coker at Antwerp. I was hoping you might be able to make similar comments about the Rotterdam hydrocracker.","First of all, just the size of the unit. And whether you would actually be also processing your European system and potential third-party VGO through that unit? And finally, whether you have the hydrotreating capacity there to be able to handle third-party high sulfur VGO?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Let's see. I think it's primarily handling the feeds from our refinery there in Rotterdam. But let me just kind of give you a sense. Again, this is advanced technology, advanced hydrocracker from the proprietary technology.","And we think we're going to generate not only about 20 kbd of high-quality Group II lubes but also some clean products as well. And due to what we already had on the ground in Rotterdam, and this shift to a kind of a real lubes-based stocks generating machine, this is going to have substantial impact on the Rotterdam refinery profitability.","Now we talked about, and Neil talked about, some weakness in near term in the base stocks market. And clearly, that's coming because we're adding a bunch of Group II capacity, which long term is going to be very advantaged.","So don't know what we're going to be looking at when we first come on in early 2019. But it's fundamentally a very advantaged investment, one of the best returns we have. It doubles the earnings from Rotterdam. And I think again, I think it's primarily focused on \u2013 I think most of the feeds into this unit are at the refinery today.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Thank you for that. And I was just hoping that you might be able to give us where you're at in the process for that second group of three expansion projects in the Downstream. Have they all reached FID? Are they in construction? Just where are they at in the process?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, we're looking to FID Beaumont probably first quarter of next year. The Fawley unit is going to be about the same timing as Beaumont, probably more like midyear, working for an FID on that one.","Singapore is a little bit behind that. We're looking more like a 2023 or so start-up on Singapore. It's a bigger project. It's a very, very large project in Singapore. Very fundamental \u2013 fundamentally shift the whole Singapore, when you take 75 kbd of resids and turn that into a lot of lubes and clean products, that's a very, very large project. That one is a little bit later.","But Beaumont, we've been looking at all opportunities to accelerate that and try to get that on as soon as possible, because we see that one as extremely attractive.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jack, just on the Beaumont cool unit, 200,000 barrels per day. Can you share a little bit more detail in terms of how the \u2013 you're talking about that replacing maybe 100,000 barrels per day of the feed. So how's the output is going to look like at the end? How that is going to change? And what kind of CapEx we may be talking about? And when that is supposed to come on stream?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, we're looking at 2022, maybe perhaps 2021. Still looking at that pretty hard in terms of when it's going to come on stream.","What we're looking at doing is a new atmospheric pipe still. 250,000 barrels a day coming in. We'll take the middle of that tower, hydro treat it there on-site, and get some diesel fuels coming out of Beaumont. So Beaumont will net increase diesel coming out of the refinery.","And then the bottom and the top of the tower are going to be intermediate products to Baytown and to Baton Rouge, again replacing products that they're buying today. So not a lot of net increase in new product coming out of those, just lower cost.","And again, given the advantage, 30% less than industry cost, because of all of these advantages, the utilizing existing infrastructure I talked about, and well in excess of a 20% return project.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jack, should we assume that the diesel or distillate increase in Beaumont is somewhere in the 30,000 to 50,000 barrel per day, based on what you described?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Probably higher.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Higher than that?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, yeah, probably more like 60,000.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","60,000? Okay.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I mean, ballpark. I don't have the number in front of me, but something like that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And where \u2013 sure. Would that be all in ULSD, or that would it be a combination?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","It'll all be ultra-low sulfur diesel that'll be coming out, clearly, and yeah.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. And that in terms of the other, say, debottleneck opportunity, 150,000 barrel per day expansion, what kind of timeline we may be talking about?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Which project is that?","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Paul, I assume you're talking about the debottlenecks at the other facilities.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's correct. Sorry.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","So Baytown, Baton Rouge. Yeah.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, it was not 150,000, Paul, it was just 50,000.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, it is 50,000.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","So we have 450,000 capacity today; Beaumont would be another 250,000; another 50,000 on top of that; and then over 750,000 total. And I'm rounding the numbers here, but over 750,000 barrels a day after Beaumont and these other attractive debottleneck projects.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A final short one. Neil, I think earlier that you say that you will be on track to the $24 billion CapEx if we exclude the $1 billion you spent in Brazil recently. So is that means that we're going to be roughly, say, $25 billion for the year?","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, Paul, our \u2013 and as again, subject to what happens in the fourth quarter. But our current outlook is \u2013 for the full year is $25 billion.","What we've seen though throughout the year, fortunately, is some incremental opportunities to acquire additional acreage in Brazil. And that's roughly about $1 billion above what we thought we were going to get. And so that's where you get to the $25 billion. Again, that's heavily dependent on what happens in the fourth quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome, Paul. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Alastair Syme with Citi.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thanks for taking my questions. In the Analyst Day, Jack, you put out earnings expectation shots on both the Downstream and Chemicals. And I know they were the long term, but there were also numbers for 2018 and 2019.","And I'm just sort of aware your run rating well behind these, both for 2018 and sort of the expected 2019 performance in both Downstream and Chemicals. Can you sort of help us with how much of this is macro and how much of this is unplanned downtime?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, Al, so let me just say this. The market environment is very different than what we had. We assumed 2017 flat conditions. And in the Chemicals business very different. Well, actually Chemicals and Downstream both very different margin environment.","But the underlying activity that we talked about on those projections is on track. That's why I was saying these milestones of these projects starting up. So the underlying activity that's driving these earnings results that we're \u2013 these earnings projections, earnings potential projections that we talked about in March are all there.","As a matter of fact again, I think we're seeing a bit of upside. So don't know in terms of \u2013 can't give you any definite numbers in terms of earnings themselves, but I can tell you the activity is going well.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","So you would see it more as a macro then?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And on my follow-up, can you just talk around IMO? In particular, if you see scope for an emergence of compliant blends, particularly in the Asian region?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I don't know if I can answer that question specifically. But I can just tell you that we're supportive of the timing. We think that the industry will be able to adapt. We think it's the right thing to do in terms of going from 3.5% sulfur down to 0.5%.","And we're going to be ready. And we're going to be ready with a bunch of different options. So as I mentioned, we'll still have HSFO, we'll have a low sulfur fuel as well, we'll have a marine gas oil, and we'll have LNG. To the extent that some ships convert to LNG, we'll have that as well.","And then also we have a lot of coking capacity that will be churning out some \u2013 destroying that distillate and churning \u2013 destroying that resid and churning out some high-quality distillate. So I think we're going to be ready. And we're looking forward to that environment.","So I can't really tell you anything specific about what others are doing or what the markets are doing. Going to be hard to see how that \u2013 what the impacts are going to be on that overall. Obviously, the clean\/dirty spread is going to grow. And we don't know how much and don't know for how long. So I think the industry is going to deal with it just fine.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you. Good morning.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Hey, Roger.","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess the question earlier was asked about buying things or whatever. And you detailed in the fourth quarter some of the asset sales coming through on the Downstream side.","I was wondering, in a market where oil prices have recovered, you clearly are focused on the investment side, but everything has to compete for capital. Do you see any acceleration potential in dispositions over the next couple of years? And particularly as the Upstream starts to transition with a greater component from the lower 48, if that makes it an easier decision to move forward on asset sales?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, let me just \u2013 we kind of hinted at this and talked about it a little bit back in March and certainly in dialogue. I think we've all been having \u2013 we've been saying that we are going to be more active in terms of looking at our Upstream assets.","And as we bring on \u2013 as you mentioned, as we bring on all these high-quality assets and invest in these new accretive volumes clearly we need to be looking at the other end of the portfolio and seeing what might be worth more to somebody else than it is to us, given where our portfolio is heading. So we are already more active and we'll continue to be more active in that area.","What I can't give you is any specifics right now in terms of the timing, in terms of how those transactions, when those transactions may happen. Obviously, we need to have an active buyer as well as a seller.","But we have had some \u2013 and if you think about what we've announced year to date with the Norway divestment that was last year and then Scarborough and the Rockies gas, that we have been active. And that activity is going to continue to ramp up.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for that, Jack, and I appreciate the greater disclosure Exxon is giving. But I didn't really expect you to give me a list of projects that you were going to be unloading here.","As a follow-up \u2013 oh, sorry. Just as a quick follow-up, the question about share repos was asked. But I was wondering since you mentioned debt had declined to $40 billion, lowest since 2015, I was just curious. Is there a debt goal, debt-to-cap, net debt, total debt number, recapturing the top credit rating? Any of that kind of drivers that we should think about in terms of where debt goes down the road?","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. This is Neil, Roger. I'll take that one. We don't target a specific credit rating. We don't target a specific debt level.","Again, I think the aim or the goal is to ensure that we maintain financial strength, financial capacity, so that we can act countercyclically. We can take advantage of investment opportunities regardless of the price cycle.","But aiming or putting a specific target out there, we don't typically do that. But again, we already have a very \u2013 as you know, we have industry leading strength on the balance sheet. And then we want to maintain that, so we can take advantage of opportunities, but we don't target any specific debt level or credit rating.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","And we view it as a competitive advantage, Roger. I mean you can imagine it gives us a lot of capacity to use that balance sheet when we see accretive opportunities.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, thank you, Roger.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob West with Redburn.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Oh, hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to ask the first one about the comments you made earlier around your Downstream investments. And the question is, are you surprised how little some of your peers are investing in new either capacity or complexity at their refining base? And could you just make some comments about why you think that might be, if it is a trend that you are seeing?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, I would just say, mildly, yes, surprised. But I don't really know why. I mean I think that's something you'd have to ask them.","One thing I would like to say though, is as we think about refining investments, we're really not interested in kind of plain vanilla industry standard refining at an industry standard unit, that conversion capacity, that kind of thing. We're bringing proprietary technology and\/or footprint advantages on all those projects we had. So they are all well in excess of what others might see on their potential refining investments. And I think that probably differentiates us.","In addition to that, you look at some of the differentiated products we have coming out as well. So I think that may be a reason why.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. Just second one would be on digital. And really the question is, what is your number one highlight in the digital space in the last 12 months? And the context for asking is, I've seen one of your peers talk about having 20 million data points a day at a new Gulf of Mexico platform. And I've seen one of your other peers just signed a big new agreement with a machine-learning company. Is there something that you'd point to in that space? Or would you say it's less active than peers there?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, let me \u2013 Neil might want to weigh in on this one too, but let me just make a comment. I can assure you we are very active in this space.","We have had a lot of discussions at the management committee level around all the things we're doing in digital.","We are not rushing out to do a me-too type project in digital. But we are putting in the underlying infrastructure to give us advanced analytic capabilities. We are doing things like pervasive Wi-Fi in our facilities to where we can make our operators much more productive. We have real-time data feeding in from all our major pieces of equipment that's improving reliability. So we are \u2013 we don't \u2013 you're right. We haven't talked about it as much as some of our competitors, but we are very active in the space.","All aspects of our business have big digital organizations in them, looking at all that opportunity. And that's coordinated with a central IT organization that's looking at the overall strategy. So very active, and we are seeing some bottom-line benefits for sure.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","And maybe one example I can give. You look at what we're doing on the subsurface. And you can imagine over time how much seismic data we've collected as a company. And so one of the areas we're looking at is digitizing that. And again, with the idea of using artificial intelligence and big data to help us continue to look for resources. That's one specific example. But again, I think it's happening across the business.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Thank you. Thank you for those perspectives.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good. Thank you, Rob. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. We'll take our last question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.","Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in at the end of the call.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, good morning, Jason.","Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Firstly, just on \u2013 yeah, morning. Just on the Brazil acreage footprint expanding here. Can you first remind us, of that $1 billion, how much has been spent year to date?","And secondly on that, there haven't really been many updates on the Carcara development. Can you give us any updates that you have? Or how you're thinking about this project coming along, given not much coming from you or your partners in that project?","Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. Let me handle the last part of the question, and maybe Neil could chime in on the numerics on the investments this year.","On Carcara, we're working with Equinor on that, as they're operating that development. And again, we see that as a recoverable resource of more than 2 billion barrels of high-quality oil.","We've had another on-block discovery that could increase that further. So it's looking good, continuing to progress. We're still talking, continuing to talk about what's the optimum development plan and timing on that. But we see it as very attractive. I think we both absolutely agree it's very attractive. And we see that as kind of being a 2023, 2024-type start-up, depending on a number of factors on the permits and when we get going there.","But one thing I'd like to mention is that I talked about 26 blocks in Brazil. And all these are blocks we went after because we saw on seismic some attractive features that we wanted to look at a lot harder.","The only thing we had in our outlook from Brazil that's been included in those earning projection outlook we talked about back in March is just the one Carcara. Everything else in Brazil is complete upside to the outlook we had.","And we do see it as very, very prospective. We're very excited about the program now. We're probably going to spend the rest of this year, next year acquiring additional 3D seismic, interpreting that. Maybe 2020 before we're out there drilling new exploration wells. But we see they're very prospective. And we're very excited about the opportunities there.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Right. Maybe I can give you a little perspective on year to date. So again, with the acquisition of the Tit\u00e3 block, which was roughly 71,000 acres, we're now up to 2.3 million net. I think year-to-date approximate numbers will be \u2013 I think full year will be around $2 billion, which is again about $1 billion above what we had in plan.","And Jack mentioned the 26 blocks that we're in. I think the other thing that's attractive is we operate approximately 66% of those blocks. And then most of them are under concession contracts as well. So a very attractive position.","Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Great. Thank you, Jason, and thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight a third quarter that included strong earnings and cash flow performance, supported by improved operations and significant liquids growth.","I'd also like to remind you that our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, will participate in our fourth quarter and full year earnings review. We appreciate your continued interest, and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation."],"8945":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2015  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Woodbury - VP, IR and Secretary","Analysts","Phil Gresh - J.P.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call and Webcast. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web-site. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Now turning to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the second quarter. We are delivering on our investment and operating commitments across our integrated portfolio. Corporation's results demonstrate sound operations, superior project execution capabilities and continued discipline in both capital and expense management.","Downstream and Chemical earnings increased significantly from the second quarter of 2014 driven by higher margins, continued strong demand and the quality of our product and asset mix. Upstream production volumes of 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day were 3.6% higher compared to a year ago quarter and liquids volumes were up nearly 12%.","Growth was underpinned by an increased level of new development start-ups over the last 18 months, largely in Africa, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. These results underscore the resilience of our integrated portfolio and the benefits of our disciplined capital allocation. In the first half of 2015, the Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion with free cash flow remaining positive despite challenging market conditions.","Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth improved in the second quarter of 2015. The U.S. rebounded after contracting slightly in the first quarter. Europe improved marginally amid concerns on Greece, China's economy stabilized, while Japan's growth tapered. Crude oil prices partly recovered during the quarter while natural gas prices declined further. Refining margins continued to strengthen in both the U.S. and Europe. Chemical commodity margins also improved while specialty margins weakened.","Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated, second quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, which represents $1 per share. Corporation distributed $4.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $1 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $8.3 billion, which is in line with plans. We have remained focused on structural improvements through capital efficiency as well as the capture of additional cost savings in a softer market. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.4 billion, and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $33.8 billion.","Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. For the quarter, cash decreased from $5.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $7.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $500 million in the third quarter of 2015.","Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil second quarter earnings of $4.2 billion were down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream and Chemical results. Gains on asset sales were $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting the absence of the Hong Kong power and Canadian asset divestments in the Upstream segment.","I'll also note that our corporate effective tax rate was 45%, up 4 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter and up 12 percentage points sequentially. This higher tax rate reflects the relative mix of income across geographies and tax regimes as well as a one-time increase in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta, Canada.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $750 million as lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partly offset by higher Chemical results. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","Now turning to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9, Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $2 billion, down $5.9 billion from the second quarter of 2014. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $1.5 billion where crude declined by almost $46 per barrel and gas was down almost $2.40 per thousand cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $330 million driven by production growth on our new developments.","All other items were negative $1.7 billion and this was driven by the absence of divestment gains from Hong Kong power and Western Canadian assets which represented $1.6 billion. Also, the higher income tax rate in Alberta, Canada resulted in a negative $260 million non-cash deferred tax adjustment. Lower operating costs provided a partial offset.","Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 139,000 barrels per day or 3.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 243,000 barrels per day or nearly 12%, benefiting from new projects or programs and favorable entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 622 million cubic feet per day or 5.8% driven by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. Volume adds from the Papua New Guinea LNG and Hadrian South projects along with entitlement effects offset build decline.","Now turning to sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, Upstream earnings were $824 million lower than the first quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $600 million as crude was up almost $11 per barrel while gas declined about $1 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $420 million driven by lower seasonal gas demand in Europe, regulatory constraints in the Netherlands and maintenance in the U.S. All other items reduced earnings by $1 billion, mainly driven by unfavorable tax and foreign exchange effects and lower gains from asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the second quarter was $5.77 per barrel, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Earnings per barrel for the first half of 2015 was $6.74.","Moving to Slide 12, sequentially, volumes were down 269,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 6.3%. Liquids production increased 14,000 barrels per day on new project growth and work programs, partly offset by maintenance, entitlement effects and field decline. Natural gas production was down 1.7 billion cubic feet per day driven by lower seasonal demand in Europe and regulatory constraints in the Netherlands.","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $795 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our margins increased earnings by $1.1 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $80 million. All other items reduced earnings by $230 million, driven by higher maintenance activities.","Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $161 million. Stronger refining margins mainly in the U.S. increased earnings by $140 million whereas higher maintenance activities reduced volumes and increased expenses by $160 million and $140 million respectively.","Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings were more than $1.2 billion, up $405 million versus the prior year quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $340 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $20 million. All other items increased earnings by $50 million, mainly due to asset management gains, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving to Slide 16, sequentially, Chemical earnings increased by $264 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $10 million. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $40 million. All other items added $230 million as asset management gains were partly offset by higher maintenance.","Moving next to an update on our exploration and project activities on Slide 17, we continue to focus on pursuing a diverse set of high-quality resource opportunities. In Guyana, ExxonMobil made a significant oil discovery on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block well which was drilled approximately 120 miles offshore, encountered more than 295 feet of high-quality oil\u2011bearing sandstone reservoirs. We are encouraged by these results and we're assessing commercial viability of the resource as well as evaluating additional potential on the block.","In Romania, drilling continues in the deepwater Neptun Block with five wells drilled to date. The potential for commercial development will be assessed after completion of the drilling program. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, drilling activities on the [Al-Kush] [ph] Block are underway and anticipated to finish later this year.","Turning now to the status update on our new development projects, in Canada, the Kearl expansion project started up ahead of schedule in June and is currently producing more than 100,000 barrels of bitumen per day. This development of the Kearl resource enabled us to draw significant learnings from the initial development project and capture lower capital costs and operating efficiencies. From Kearl, production averaged 130,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and is ultimately expected to reach 220,000 barrels per day.","Erha North Phase 2 in Nigeria is another example of a capital efficient development. This subsea project utilizes existing processing facilities and avoids the need for an additional FPSO vessel. Deepwater drilling and subsea equipment installation are progressing with start-up expected later this year.","And at the Banyu Urip development in Indonesia, we continue to experience favorable well performance and production is now more than 80,000 barrels per day. The central processing facility is expected to start up in the next few months which will enable the project to reach peak production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year-end.","In the U.S., Lower 48 onshore, we have maintained a measured investment program to unlock the value of more than 15 billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil is a leading producer onshore and the largest producer in the United States. Through our XTO affiliate, we operate in all major U.S. unconventional oil and gas plays. Longer-term, gas investment is paced with anticipated demand growth whereas near-term emphasis is on the development of 2.4 million net acres in the liquids rich Bakken, Permian and Woodford, Ardmore and Marietta where investment opportunities remain attractive in phased price environment. Net production in these three areas was about 240,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the second quarter, up more than 20% from the second quarter of last year.","Throughout the commodity price cycle, ExxonMobil has a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency in our operations while maintaining high operational integrity. We regularly assess our performance relative to the competitors and strive to be best in class. So as this chart illustrates, our efforts deliver results. XTO is a leader in exploration and development costs per barrel of crude reserves added, just one metric of many that are considered.","This position is enabled by our disciplined and measured approach to resource development, deployment of proprietary technologies and our intense focus on efficiency and productivity. We also demonstrated the capability to respond quickly and a rapidly changing environment and to date have captured incremental savings of about 30% drilling and completion cost from the peak in 2014. These savings include market benefits as well as ongoing structural cost efficiencies and productivity improvements across our operations.","So I'd like to conclude this morning's comments with a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the Corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through midyear, ExxonMobil earned $9.1 billion benefiting from our integrated business which captures value throughout the commodity price cycle as demonstrated by our Downstream and Chemical results. In the Upstream, production increased to 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up almost 3% year on year and remains in line with our plans.","Volume contributions from successful new developments underscore our superb project execution capabilities and reputation as a reliable operator. Our operational results combined with continued capital discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion and free cash flow of $3.9 billion. Our commitment to our shareholders remains strong as the Corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders through midyear. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan.","Phil Gresh","First question is one asking the CapEx, what your latest thoughts are for the budget for this year, and then as we look ahead post 2015, at the Analyst Day you said sub-$34 billion, it was a bit vague, a lot of your peers have been talking about reducing their sustaining capital cost as you look ahead. So just wanted to get any thoughts from you about perhaps where CapEx could go over the next few years, if you have any updates.","Jeff Woodbury","I'll tell you that we have no new guidance on our \u2013 so our CapEx guidance for 2015 remains at $34 billion, but having said, given our ongoing focus on capital efficiency and the very successful capture of market savings in the current business climate, I think it is fair to say that there is a downward vector on that number. And that type of focus and efficiency will be carried on into the subsequent years. I haven't said that, also note that we continue to invest in the business and we have a very attractive inventory of high-quality opportunities, and given the financial flexibility we've got, we can garner some real benefits during the down cycle in a softer market environment.","Phil Gresh","Sure, okay. Second question is on the acquisition environment, seems like others have been talking about the bid ask spread, maybe starting to improve a bit here, maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing, are any attractive opportunities starting to pop up on your radar screen, and just more broadly, as you think about the portfolio, are there places where you think inorganically you'd like to shift the mix every time, and I'm specifically thinking about short cycle?","Jeff Woodbury","Let me just broadly speak on acquisition or what we like to say as asset management, I characterize it for us as businesses as normal. We always keep alert to value opportunities not only to pick up what we believe is strategic and high-value opportunities but looking for means to create greater value from our existing portfolio. So we keep alert in terms of what we would target.","If you step back and think about the diversity of our resource base, we're very well covered across all of the resource types. We're always interested in expanding those positions or further high-grading them. So I wouldn't suggest that as we consider opportunities for picking up additional assets that we're more focused in one area or the other, we're always looking for high-grade in the portfolio. And Phil, that also includes our exploration program. It is designed to identify higher value opportunities to be added to the resource base or maybe to displace what we see is not as relatively significant as the exploration program can add to.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Sorry my line cut out there for a minute, so I hope this question hasn't been asked already, but there's two things I wanted to hit this morning, Jeff, if I may. First one is on tax. I'm trying to understand the extent of I guess the mess on the internationally Imperial we're all looking at anyway, and we're noting what Imperial did with their tax charge related to the change in the Canadian tax regime. So I wonder if you could address that issue first, and then I have a follow-up please.","Jeff Woodbury","So if you look at our tax in the second quarter of 2015 relative to 2014, we're up just over 3%. I'd say that about 5% of that were associated with one-time tax items, the largest piece being in the Alberta tax that I mentioned in my prepared comments. The rest of the closure on that, down about 1% is really due to the portfolio mix of income across our various business segments and geographies. If you look sequentially, Doug, we're up almost 12%. And again, the mix effect adds about a 6% increase and the one-time items add about 6%, 4% due to the Alberta tax increase and then just under 2% associated with the absence of the first quarter U.K.'s tax rate change.","Doug Leggate","In absolute terms, Jeff, order of magnitude it looks to us like that was somewhere around $0.10 or $0.12 in the quarter of non-recurring non-cash. Is that sum about right?","Jeff Woodbury","Say a little bit more, Doug, on how you're coming up with that.","Doug Leggate","So I think the $320 million was what Imperial took, that alone is $0.08, right?","Jeff Woodbury","The Alberta, as I said in my prepared comments, Doug, was about $260 million ExxonMobil share.","Doug Leggate","Okay, alright. I'll go back and look at that. My follow-up is really on the Downstream. I mean obviously, I realize for commercial reasons you don't want to talk about Torrance explicitly but when we look at the can of results that other West Coast operators have had and the relatively weak year at Downstream that you had, it kind of strikes me that you probably have some \u2013 there's probably some merit in giving us some idea of what the likelihood of Torrance coming back on line is without all the additional cost of importing gasoline and so on. So to the best that you can at this point, Jeff, can you give us an order of magnitude in terms of timing as to when you expect Torrance to get back to where it ought to be?","Jeff Woodbury","I think first if I could, Doug, just to comment on your statement about a relatively weak Downstream in the second quarter, now I'd first say that we've seen significant margin improvement relative to last year. Second, as I commented on, we did have a very heavy maintenance period in the second quarter of 2015 and that had the downward impacts I referenced in my prepared comments.","In terms of Torrance, I think you probably know, Doug, that some of the units in the refinery are operational that reduced rates. We are producing gasoline by importing components and blending with refinery production, and I'd also say we're also producing distillates. We are progressing repair of the electrostatic precipitator as well as pursuing interim options. It is difficult to provide you a time at this point, given the definition work that's underway as well as the regulatory review that's underway. As we get closer to defining that timeline, we'll look for an opportunity to share that broadly.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate you there. You've at least taken a stab at the answer. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard and Weil.","Blake Fernandez","Question for you on the gas volumes which were fairly weak, I think you pointed out in the press release 622 million cubic feet down year-over-year. Could you highlight the Netherlands component of that, maybe give us an update of, for one, what contribution the Netherlands had in that decline, and then maybe some timing or outlook on when that may come back?","Jeff Woodbury","The Netherlands was, as you could appreciate, a large component. It was about 600 million in the second quarter relative to the prior year, prior quarter.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, and any thoughts on when that may return to market?","Jeff Woodbury","The Netherlands on a quarter to quarter basis was also say with the regulatory restrictions that the government has placed on the asset, and that will return over time but it's going to be a constrained cap on what we can produce from the resource.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, fair enough. The second question for you, on Slide 11 you highlighted some of the sequential decline. I guess I know the benchmarks were up, I know you've got some issues with tax and whatnot, but that $1 billion waterfall on other category, can you kind of highlight what is in there besides tax and then also if you could maybe highlight some of the LNG impacts? I know pricing got clearly weak this quarter.","Jeff Woodbury","So on the $1 billion other component, this is the [indiscernible] and about 60% of that had to do with tax, 15% or so was Forex and the rest is a number of other puts and takes. On your comment about LNG, let me just broadly say that our natural gas realizations had a negative effect of about $300 million. So to square that with the $600 million increase in realizations, we had about $900 million positive due to liquids and $300 million due to negative gas realizations.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Let me follow up on CapEx and the down-cycle approach, your peers appear or at least are more vocal in cost-cutting and laying off employees, increasing asset sales and reducing the forward CapEx guidance to close their funding gaps by almost extensional upstream struggle. So I mean your releasing call has been different. Is that just stylistic or does it mean a different approach by Exxon through the down-cycle, any comments there?","Jeff Woodbury","I would back up and just talk fundamentally. Culturally, the organization is designed to constantly focus on capital efficiency and cost management, okay. What we are looking for always, Evan, is to drive the cost structure down in the business, okay, and when we have a down-cycle like we're seeing right now, we further are well-positioned to quickly lead that cost curve in capturing market savings. Now on top of that, we've got that financial flexibility to invest through the cycle and that does very much very well position us to capture those market savings in the down-cycle. So in short, I'd say it is a focus regardless of where we are in the cycle.","Likewise on staffing, I mean you mentioned common staffing. I mean first and foremost, I want to highlight that our people are our greatest asset and they really drive the success of this Company. Therefore we take a very measured approach managing our headcount given the cyclical nature of the business and the need for us to be ever more productive and in doing so we keep an unrelenting focus on capturing organizational efficiencies to keep the organization right sized, again, given the likelihood of business volatility.","So if you look at our employee headcount, it has been coming down consistently since the merger of Exxon and Mobil where we were at about 125,000 employees, today we're at just over 80,000 employees. And you may recall during Analyst Meeting that the Chairman talked about some this and he gave some examples by way of steps that we've taken well in advance of the down-cycle in order to do exactly what the numbers are depicting.","Evan Calio","Right, and your CapEx appears to be trending at least below guidance so far this year. My follow-up on the Downstream and maybe as it relates to the U.S. Upstream, I mean can you discuss like crude transfer pricing assumptions between North American Upstream and refining? I mean it would appear that refining with offset may not be entirely market-based kind of understating refining and transferring some of that to your Upstream, any color there would be helpful.","Jeff Woodbury","I mean it is very much market-based. I mean as you know that our integrated sites have the capability to run at very, very wide range of feedstocks. I can't get into the specific pricing at all but we have very competitive capacity within the U.S., we're the largest in the Gulf Coast and mid-continent. As you know, our capacity increase is greater than our overall U.S. production. So we're also out there picking up supplies that meet our systems needs.","Our mid-continent and Gulf Coast refineries have increased processing of advantaged North American crudes. Currently about 45% of the slate was North America in 2011 and currently we're at about 70% in 2014. The key point I want to emphasize here is that we get intrinsic value given the integration of our operations between Upstream, Downstream and the Chemical business, allowing us to really focus on optimizing the value of the molecule.","Operator","Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse has our next question.","Edward Westlake","This is just a philosophical question. I mean, Jeff, you've got a great balance sheet and you've just reduced the buyback. Are you worried about future deterioration in cash flows due to the macro, is this just a decision that's just made quarter to quarter without thinking about the implications? I know people are chattering in the market this morning that you're trying to conserve cash for M&A, so maybe just a comment there, and then I've got a detailed comment on the results.","Jeff Woodbury","Ed, just go back, fundamentally our business plans and our investment strategy comes from our perspective on the long-term that we share with you all in our energy outlook. That's what really sets our business strategy and our investment outlook. Now stepping back from that, we maintain a very robust balance sheet as you say and we have the significant inventory investment opportunities, over 90 billion barrels of high-quality resource, a very strong inventory of Downstream and Chemical opportunities, but we manage the cash flow looking at the current business climate as well as the future outlook and we have a high degree of confidence in what we expect supply\/demand to do in the future. Fundamentally, we're committed to our shareholders to continue to provide a reliable and grown dividend and I think the continued buyback is evidence of the confidence that we have in the integrated business model.","Edward Westlake","You mentioned the LNG impact which was helpful. Obviously Asia LNG prices might come in the spot market particularly, not contract, come under where the pressure is. All of these Australian projects try and fight their way into market and they all have commission cargoes and some spot with them. Can you sort of give us a sense of how much flexibility in the overall contract structure your customers have to sort of say, we're going to take minimum amounts of volumes to maximize our advantage to take some perhaps the cheapest bulk cargoes that are available? I'm just trying to get a sense of is there a little bit of the margin or price risk and volume risk even to your sort of existing LNG business, and it's fine for you to say, no, there's not a big risk, I mean that could just be the answer.","Jeff Woodbury","Sure. I'd just remind you that a majority of our LNG is under long-term contract. So we have very little spot risk and we've got diversion capability in the existing contracts to allow us to capture a greater value there.","Edward Westlake","So if Asia says, no, you can put it into Europe or do something else from the Middle East.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","So it's pretty clear that there is a path to grow production through 2017 with some of these large capital projects that you talked about and seeing indications of production growth here in 2015, one of the questions investors frequently ask is, how does Exxon grow production post 2017 which we'll probably get some line of sight on at the next Analyst Day when you roll forward past 2017, but any initial color about how you think about growth especially if the forward curve proves correct post 2017 would be valuable?","Jeff Woodbury","I'd say first and foremost, just step back a moment and remind everybody that based on that very sizable high-quality resource base we've been talking about, we've had a very significant Upstream investment program in place now for some period of time whereby from 2012 to 2017 we had committed to our shareholders to bring on 32 high-quality long-life assets. We're about halfway through that in terms of starting them up. We had a very substantial tranche of them starting up in 2014 with eight. This year we have another seven starting up. As you go into 2016-2017, we've got the rest of them coming on. The information that we had shared back at Analyst Meeting, we would grow capacity by about 1.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, and recognizing that those projects are starting up in 2017, we're just at the early stages, they would ramp up into 2018 and thereafter.","We also shared, Neil, in our F&O review the list of projects that we've got on the table right now for 2018 forward. These are all in different stages of progress, some are in development planning, some are in [beat] [ph], but that is the list that we are working on to bring to an FID decision. Some of these that we're working to further optimize in the current price environment, some may have some opportunities to enhance the commercial terms, but as we get closer to FID's decisions, we'll signal where we are. As you indicated, we'll provide another update in March of next year which will take us beyond the 2017 horizon.","But all that said, I want to reinforce that we've got this very robust inventory of investment opportunities and I don't want to focus just on the Upstream, the Downstream and Chemical business as well, and that positions us well to be very selective on what we want to progress and when we want to progress, and it gives us the capability on those other assets or investment opportunities to keep working on them to make sure that we're capturing the greatest value from it.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Jeff. And then the follow-up is on that point about Chemicals, it was one of the few places in the quarter where we saw a real upside to our numbers. Just wanted to talk about what you're seeing from the macro in the Chemical space, clearly margins having compressed as much as some would've thought given the move down in Brent and then just how you're thinking about growing that business on a go forward.","Jeff Woodbury","So just broadly speaking, as you can appreciate, there are structural differences in the Chemical business. U.S. natural gas, natural gas liquids provide for very strong margins and advantage polyethylene. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, the liquids fees, energy prices have been hard and we were at the bottom cycle in Asia-Pacific but we saw in the first half material improvement due to lower fees and energy costs.","Specialty margins have declined over the past few years with capacity additions exceeding demand growth, but demand growth remains robust. So as we've said before, our long-term business we have a positive outlook for global demand expecting to exceed GDP by about 1.5%, or said in another way, growing by more than 50% over the next 10 years, of which about two thirds of that will be in Asia. So very well positioned to participate, as you see that we're making some important investments like the expansion of Baytown that allows us to continue to participate in the high value polyethylene market given the very low feed cost we have here in North America.","Operator","We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good","I appreciate the comments on the whole savings in the U.S. Lower 48. I wonder if you could offer what Exxon is seeing as far as cost savings internationally, free the projects under construction, maybe some currently in the development phase and maybe even offshore as well, do you expect to capture some of the cost savings there and what would be some of the timing on that relative to what you've seen so far in the U.S.?","Jeff Woodbury","I would tell you Allen that let me break it up between capital and expense, and to answer your question right now, yes, we are capturing cost savings across our global portfolio. On the cost side, I just want to keep on emphasizing, cost management is a fundamental driver in the success of our business, no doubt about it, and throughout that business cycle our organization has a strong culture of driving down the cost structure and then when we're in these down cycles we expect to lead the cost curve and capture additional market savings, so ongoing structure improvements and additional market savings in the down-cycle.","So we're very well positioned and one of the things that allows us to react very quick, as I mentioned last quarter, is that we've got a global procurement organization that is always focused on capturing the lowest lifecycle cost and they are absolutely critical in managing our overall cost structure.","As you can appreciate, Allen, savings vary significantly by region and type of service. By way of example, our base metals are down as much as 40%. Engineering services and construction labor is down 10% plus. Rig rates are down across the board both land and floater. On floater, the day rates of mobilization costs are down anywhere from 25% to 40%. So we're well positioned to capture that both on the cost as well as the capital side.","Allen Good","Great, thanks. One more question, maybe a bit premature but certainly made headlines of late, along with the Iran deal, it seems that some of your peers have become interested, I know there's been some headlines suggesting Exxon as well, what would you need to see in Iran as far as milestones for you potentially become interesting and doing business there?","Jeff Woodbury","Allen, I'd just say that we'll continue to monitor the circumstance and I want to be really clear that we'll remain in full compliance with existing sanctions. As you know there are multiple sanctions that apply to U.S. companies. That's all I can really say about that right now, Allen.","Operator","We'll go next to Asit Sen with Cowen and Company.","Asit Sen","Two questions. Thanks for the additional color on Lower 48. I'm wondering if you could give us the breakdown in the production and rig activity by the three main unconventional plays and talk about how you expect things tracking in the back half of the year.","Jeff Woodbury","So really good growth there, I mean from a net production basis, as I said we're producing about 240,000 barrels a day, over 20% increase quarter on quarter versus the prior year. Permian is about 120,000 barrels of that, Bakken just over 80,000 barrels, and Woodford is about 40,000 barrels.","Asit Sen","And rig activity please?","Jeff Woodbury","So our rig counts have come down just a little bit. From the first quarter we're down about 10 rigs, so we're currently running 34 rigs in those three plays. We've been able to continue to high-grade the activity. I think as we showed in the Analyst Meeting, we continue to capture both cost efficiencies and productivity improvements. A lot of what we learned in these plays are being quickly shared to make sure that we're integrating all those learnings into our forward execution plans, but very pleased with the positions that we've got in those assets and we've got a very sizable inventory of drillable prospects.","Asit Sen","So would you think that there would be upside to the incremental 2017 target? I think it was 150,000 barrels a day. Would you, given efficiencies?","Jeff Woodbury","I mean we are keeping a measured pace as we said previously. If you think back over the ups and downs, when everybody was really picking up a lot of rigs, we took a measured pace and made sure that we were going at a pace that we can fully capture the benefits of the learnings that we were realizing. Likewise in the down-cycle, our rig counts haven't come down as significant as you've seen in the industry because we've been able to capture those learnings, the economics of these investments are still robust. So I would give you a response of a measured pace that with a very attractive inventory of opportunities, we'll keep moving forward and anticipate as we showed in the Analyst Meeting a growth in our unconventional liquids volumes.","Asit Sen","Great. And my second question is on LNG. Spot LNG market has been surprisingly strong, over $8 near-term, would be 15% oil equivalent. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that, is it seasonality or something else, and could you update on the demand pattern that you're seeing in Asia?","Jeff Woodbury","Broadly speaking, I mean as you can appreciate, there's a lot that goes into this. As we've said, gas demand has grown at about 1.6% per year. LNG capacity will probably triple from 2010 to 2040. So you're seeing a general demand growth that's underpinning, obviously underpinning realizations. There are a lot of other country-level dynamics like alternatives, nuclear power, fuel switching from coal to gas, all those variables really play into this 1.6% per year that I mentioned.","Operator","Paul Cheng with Barclays has our next question.","Paul Cheng","Two questions if I could, if we're looking at your very sizable total resource which is over [indiscernible], do you have a rough estimate that what's the percentage of that resource base already passed all the regulatory hurdle and with today's technology will be able to produce and earn a 10% after-tax [indiscernible] way of return a $60 to $70 barrel price, any kind of color you can provide?","Jeff Woodbury","I would tell you, I'd actually think about it differently, Paul, and that the resource base is in various stages of development planning. Some assets clearly, as I indicated previously to Neil, some of those assets are currently on the table right now in development planning and pre-feed, some of the assets are probable reserves in our possible or static resources or under various stages of development planning in order to ensure that we are defining the most attractive returns for those resources. And some, we make it to the point, Paul, that we have a better alternative to monetize, that may include divestment. But it's a dynamic resource base that is constantly being upgraded with new additions, pulling things out that we don't see as creating a value for the Corporation.","And I'll give you one example by way of illustration. You think about the sizable Julia resource and how we've optimized that to a much smaller initial development in order to de-risk the overall resource size, that's the type of optimization that I'm talking about and based on that derisking it will there position us on future investment opportunities.","Paul Cheng","Great. Second question, just some quick number, I think in a number of segments that you have some asset sales gain. Can you just give us what is the asset sales gain in the second quarter by segment and breakdown between U.S. and international and also tell us what is the Kearl current production in Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately?","Jeff Woodbury","So in terms of the earnings impact from our asset sales in the second quarter, it was about $490 million. A majority of that, Paul, was in the Chemical business. In terms of Kearl, it's in total as I said is producing about 130 \u2013 or in the second quarter it was producing about 230,000 barrels per day. The Phase 1 or the initial development was around 100,000 barrels and Phase 2 was around 30,000 barrels.","Paul Cheng","Jeff, do you have the latest number in July in the last couple, maybe a week or so, on Kearl?","Jeff Woodbury","On Kearl, no, I don't have anything to share at this point.","Operator","We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Guess one question hasn't really been asked I'd like to get out there, oil prices this low, last time we had sustained lower for longer situation, lot of mergers in the space. I know you don't want to talk about anything specific but as a general sort of commentary on maybe the bid ask spread that's out there, the type of assets that might be interesting to axe on, if you could give us any clarity on that?","Jeff Woodbury","Roger, that was similar to an earlier question. As I said earlier, I would just say that we keep alert to where we've got value propositions, and the way I clarify that is, you know bolt-on acquisitions that have natural synergies with our business, long-life assets that we think that our expertise in operating experience will bring intrinsic value associated with it, it's not focused on a specific resource type but it's really focused on where we think that our unique experiences can add value that others can't see.","Roger Read","And on the bid ask spread, maybe how that's \u2013 if it's changed at all, if there's anything you can add there?","Jeff Woodbury","Roger, I really don't have much to add on there. I mean that's really a function of the transactions. I mean that certainly staying in a lower price environment is going to encourage both buyers and sellers to find closure.","Roger Read","Okay. And then as kind of the unrelated follow-up, in Guyana the big discovery, is there any sort of timeline at all we can be thinking about at this point for the next appraisal well and then if that goes, how you think about some of the other things including the I guess border dispute with Venezuela, et cetera?","Jeff Woodbury","As I said, we're certainly very encouraged by the first well. It is one well in a very, very large block. We are currently evaluating that well and we're laying out, if you will, the plans moving forward. You can expect the intent for us to not only further appraise the discovery but pursue other opportunities on the block.","I want to be clear though that we follow all the laws within the host countries and international law, that we're operating on this block on a license from the government at Guyana, and the border matters are really a function or should stay with the governments to address through appropriate channels.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Maybe if I could one follow-up on costs, I know you've talked about cost control efforts a couple of times already, but maybe not on the CapEx side but if we look on the OpEx side or the expense side of the Company, a lot of your competitors have talked about percentages in terms of year-over-year decreases and OpEx or targets in terms of absolute numbers that they think they can pull out of the business, I mean any guidance you can give us in terms of maybe where your cost structure might be year on year or how much you think you might be able to pull out on relative to the 2014 basis?","Jeff Woodbury","Obviously our objective is to make sure that we're capturing all those opportunities, both structural and market out there, and at the same time ensuring that we maintain the high integrity of our operations. I think, Ryan, the ultimate measure here is our industry-leading unit cost performance that we've seen over the last several years, and while it's still early I don't want to go too far with this. We are seeing the unit cost on a downward trend year-to-date, almost 9% down from where we were last year, but that's about as far as I'll quantify at this point. Obviously this is a key element to ensuring that we remain a leader in unit profitability as well.","Ryan Todd","Good, thank you. And maybe one question on LNG and thoughts over on the business, we've had a number of questions on spot pricing and trends, but if you look at \u2013 you've got a decent queue of potential development projects that could happen at some point over time, can you talk about maybe what would be the threshold that you would need to move forward on some of these projects? Is it local permitting, is it an effort on reducing costs in the industry and getting costs down to a place that's competitive, is it a wide bid ask spread between buyers and sellers right now, any thoughts in general I guess on your asset portfolio on LNG on the development side and what you're seeing in the market?","Jeff Woodbury","Sure. Broadly speaking, as you know, LNG is a key component of our portfolio and it's an important part of our margin generation. As I said earlier, we've got a very good inventory and including in that inventory is a number of LNG projects and it's all based on our assessment. As I indicated that gas will grow by about 1.6% per year between now and 2040 and more specifically LNG demand will triple from 2010 to 2040. So that is the value proposition we're pursuing. We've got a number of projects moving forward concurrently. We're going to be very selective in what we invest in.","To your question about what does it take to make it go forward, it's all the things you mentioned, it's making sure that we get a competitive cost structure, that we've got stable transparent fiscal terms to underpin a very capital intensive investment, and that's why we're progressing settlement at the same time. I would tell you that kind of the brownfield type expansions are probably going to be the lowest cost LNG add.","By way of example, our Papua New Guinea project, just a phenomenal outcome, started up ahead of schedule, very, very good reliability, very well-positioned to compete in expansion should we identify sufficient resource, having the assets that we have in the U.S. positions us very well, Alaska, West Coast of Canada continue to progress. Those opportunities will require more of what we were talking about in terms of cost, in terms of fiscal terms, regulatory environment. So in short, what I'd say, Ryan, is that the demand projection is there, obviously we've got the capability to participate in that and we're very well-positioned with a very good inventory of high quality opportunities to meet that demand growth.","Operator","We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","Just looking at the Downstream business, there have been a lot of press reports and\/or regulatory filings about a potential substantial expansion of Beaumont. I was wondering if you could comment on that, provide any color around the thinking there?","Jeff Woodbury","So just again, taking a portfolio look, Brad, we regularly evaluate our assets, our various business lines for where we can grow earnings or optimize the long-term value of it, and in the Downstream business it's focused in the following areas; expanding our logistics, expanding our feedstock, reducing our overall cost structure, and importantly increasing high-value product yields. You'll see that one of those areas or one or more of those areas will underpin the investment projects that we have communicated have been through FID, such as the [indiscernible] investment.","As it pertains to Beaumont, we typically assess those activities. I understand that that may include some discussions with the regulators. It doesn't indicate that we have made a decision and when we get close to an FID and we've made that decision, we'll communicate that accordingly.","Brad Heffern","Okay, I understood. And then looking in California on the Upstream side, I was curious what the impact during the quarter was given the planned pipeline downtime and what the outlook is there?","Jeff Woodbury","Good question, Ryan. I mean as you all know, the planned All American Pipeline was down due to a failure of the line in the second quarter. We've looked for options to go ahead and keep our facility on without that pipeline running or until we are able to find an alternative export route as while it will be shut down. Before it was shut down, it was producing somewhere around 30,000 barrels a day. In fact that was a 2014 number. So we'll keep focused on it, we'll keep working with the regulator as well as the All American Pipeline to identify the earliest restart.","Operator","We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering & Holt Co.","Anish Kapadia","First question is, just looking at some of the great projects again that surpass 2018, it seems to me like you focused on three key areas or things if you like which is getting more challenged over the next few years, so when you look at international LNG, seems to be a little more competition coming in from domestic U.S. LNG. When you look at your oilsands projects, they are relatively high cost and impacted by potential carbon pricing and higher taxes coming through. In Nigeria, clearly a difficult political environment there and tax uncertainty. Just wondering, given those as kind of your key areas, how comfortable are you with those areas and the potential growth there?","Jeff Woodbury","Anish, we're in the risk management business. Everything that we do has a level of risk that we've got to judge, whether it would be geopolitical risk, economic risk, technical uncertainty, and that is the world we live in, and I think the organization has demonstrated over the years that it's got the expertise and the capabilities to take on these more challenging resources and convert them into value propositions for our shareholders.","So the areas you talked about, I mean take a look at Papua New Guinea LNG, I mean no infrastructure, we were able to build that into a very successful project that's going to supply an important part of LNG demand in the future. We have a good track record in all these areas, we're very good at capturing the learnings and transporting those learnings into our future resource development activities to make sure that we maximize return, and as I said to Paul earlier, if we don't see the value proposition there, we will find other ways to monetise that asset,","Anish Kapadia","Okay, great. And just a follow-on, in terms of your future projects, I'm just thinking, how you think about delaying projects in an attempt to in this kind of falling kind of service price environment to capture lower prices, is that something that you're actively kind of looking to do or would you just go ahead with the projects as it kind of make sense in terms of the economics at the moment?","Jeff Woodbury","I mean remember these projects that you referenced earlier are multi-year projects, they happen over a period of time and we are looking for not only the market savings but I'll stress again the structural savings. Let me use an example of what I'm talking about. We went forward with both the Arkutun-Dagi and the Hebron developments concurrently because we saw a very consistent development option and the tremendous benefit that we'd get by learning curve advantages.","So both GBS, we used a comparable design shop for both of them, we used the same GBS contractor, we used the same topside contractor, and we captured that immediate learning curve benefit. On top of that, in a lower price cycle as I said earlier, we're very well positioned with the global procurement organization to be first in line in capturing those market savings, and given our long-term investment and our expectation of what demand is going to do, we're very confident that over the timeframe \u2013 the things we're investing in today, some of them we won't see production on for five or 10 years. We're very confident in our demand projections, in our ability to turn that into accretive financial performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","When I hear what you're saying about costs and potential M&A, and knowing what you said in the past about the Permian, it feels like that's the best opportunity for you to combine the overlap that you have with the potential to drive out costs. I think you've highlighted that it's a very fragmented zone. And I would also think that the Bakken is similar. But you really don't have a lot in the Eagle Ford. So my assumption is that essentially the Permian would be the most attractive place for you and then the Bakken to take advantage of this low price environment.","Jeff Woodbury","Paul, just broadly speaking, we keep focused globally and we've got those type of opportunities in other countries that will naturally maintain a line of sight on should the right value proposition come forward. If you want to focus in them, conventional, certainly the ownership structure in the Permian by way of example is very, very diverse and where we can find natural synergies. I mean over the last several years we've made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that have increased our position there and you get a value uplift when we're able to do that where it's within our operational structure.","Paul Sankey","Yes, and I guess the operational structure is well suited because of the XTO separate division you have gives you the flexibility?","Jeff Woodbury","That's correct.","Paul Sankey","One thing I'm worried about, Jeff, is with the replacement, just in as far as I don't think you've had any FIDs this year, [indiscernible] just that your business bookings last year were heavily dominated by the U.S., could you update us on where we stand as regards with those replacements?","Jeff Woodbury","Obviously that's an annual process and we've fully replaced our production for 21 straight years. We've got a very good inventory that we're working on to convert to an FID decision and proved reserves as well as very active exploration program. So we've been very successful as the history shows and I'd say that the prognosis in the future will remain the same.","Paul Sankey","Jeff, do you know how many FIDs you had last year?","Jeff Woodbury","Not off the top of my head, Paul, no.","Operator","We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.","Alastair Syme","Thanks for your comment on operating costs earlier. Can you give us some sort of magnitude about how much of that 9% you might feel is natural deflation in the environment, like energy prices, and how much is your in cost management?","Jeff Woodbury","Alastair, I'd just tell you that the organization wants to keep focused on the structural improvements as well as net market capture. Everything is under focus constantly, even when we're at $100 per barrel, but I don't have any specific numbers to breakout on the benefit today.","Alastair Syme","And secondly, in the Chemicals business in this environment, you've seen that difference in the profitability between the base and derivative businesses?","Jeff Woodbury","Remember it's all premised under very strong demand growth and our investments are strategically placed in order to make sure that we can compete competitively over that timeframe. I think we're very well-positioned in both the commodity and specialties markets.","Operator","We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.","Guy Baber","Jeff, you highlighted on Slide 18, Lower 48 onshore F&D cost, best in class by a substantial margin. I believe those costs have been declining in recent years as well and likely continue to decline. So I was just wondering if you could discuss how that positive trend for U.S. Lower 48 F&D compares to the trends that you're seeing internationally and that you've seen in recent years, where it appears F&D for the industry has risen considerably in some cases. So can you just discuss your thoughts on that emergence, what you're seeing, and also how that might influence capital allocation and strategy long-term, so specifically does it leads you to believe you need to find a way to allocate more capital to the regions where you can most efficiently add reserves, which appears to be the U.S.?","Jeff Woodbury","I think it's an excellent question, Guy, because I think this is just one example of what we do across our whole global portfolio. I talked about by way of another example, we've shown you the XTO example. In my prepared comments, I talked about Erha North Phase 2. Last quarter I talked about the start-up of Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, but that's another really good example that instead of \u2013 that we sequenced the resource development in a manner that we can fully leverage the fixed investment over a period of time, and what that does is that lowers our overall cost structure or E&D costs globally, and in a deepwater environment where we've got to be very careful that we've got very good execution plans and that we execute flawlessly.","So it's a very strong focus across the world whether it's in the deepwater with Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 and Erha North Phase 2 or we're talking about the Arctic or sub-Arctic like in Arkutun-Dagi and Hebron, there is an ongoing emphasis to try to get that cost structure down. And that's why I made the point earlier that this is something that we have to work 365 days a year, it's not something that's driven by the price environment, it's driven by the need to be ever more productive and to compete in a market that you know there's a lot investment dollars going in. So we keep line of sight on where we've got cost opportunities.","Guy Baber","Thanks Jeff. And last one for me, liquids production up 12% on the year, so obviously very impressive growth, major projects ramping up, you get some PSC benefit obviously, but it also appears like you're showing growth in some areas where you don't have high-profile major projects, North Sea oil for example, but it appears that reliability uptime maybe improving just across the portfolio. Is that an accurate observation and is there any detail you can provide of how the base level of production is performing perhaps relative to expectations coming into the year because it seems to be doing better?","Jeff Woodbury","It's another good question and you may recall back in the Analyst presentation, we spent a little bit of time, the Chairman showed a chart that tries to \u2013 goes to quantify the volume add that we make with our focus on reliability. We are making very significant gains on improving overall operating reliability, and I'll emphasize, not only in the Upstream but also across our manufacturing business as well. As we focus intensely on cost structure, we do the same on uptime and reliability, and really try to transfer those learnings quickly across the Corporation to make sure that once again we're best in class.","Operator","Our final question for today comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Most things have been asked here but you've seen a lot of your [IFC] [ph] peers as well as some large cap E&Ps take significant impairments. You have a very robust resource base, as you've stated. Are there any issues for say intermediate-term projects coming off the books on a long-term basis for Exxon?","Jeff Woodbury","There's two parts to your question. One is, if we've got resources that are in a resource base that ultimately we don't see the long-term value, as I indicated earlier, John, we will look for ways to monetize them which may include some level of divestment. In terms specifically of impairments, as you know we live in a commodity price environment that has great volatility but as I've said several times in our energy outlook, the long-term market fundamentals remain unchanged, and the lifespan of our assets are measured really in decades, therefore our long-term price views are more stable and quite frankly more meaningful for future cash flows and market value. So we expect the business to more than recover the carrying value of the assets on the books. Obviously in the course of our ongoing asset management efforts, we do confirm that asset values fully cover carrying costs.","John Herrlin","Great, that's what I wanted to hear. One last one for me, which you probably won't answer, Guyana insignificant, you want to attach a volume sense to that?","Jeff Woodbury","John, I think it's just too early. I look forward to that done, I can have more discussion about it as well, but as I said John, one well in a 6.6 million acre block, it's a very good start and just watch that space. There's more to be said there I think.","Operator","With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to our host for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Woodbury","To conclude, again I want to thank you for your time and your very thoughtful and insightful questions this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to talk about the business and really share the successes of our people that work day in and day out to make sure that we're creating shareholder value. So thanks again and we look forward to further discussion in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining."],"8288":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  1, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","David Rosenthal - VP, Investor Relations & Secretary","Analysts","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Robert Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Doug Terreson - ISI","Allen Good - Morningstar Investment","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Paul Cheng - Barclays ","Iain Reid - Jefferies","","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we begin today, I would like to say a few words of support for those who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, which I know includes many people listening to today's call. Our thoughts are with you as you work to recover from the effects of the storm which has touched so many lives along the East Coast. We are doing everything we can in our operations to help support the recovery effort.","Now returning to Exxon Mobil\u2019s results; but before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic uncertainty continued in the third quarter with further weakness in Europe and Japan. The European growth rate is estimated to remain negative in the third quarter following the contraction in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Japan is likely to decelerate further. The US economy marginally improved versus the second quarter and China\u2019s growth rate decline moderated versus prior quarters.","Energy markets improved in the third quarter with higher crude oil and US natural gas prices and stronger industry refining margins versus the second quarter. Although, US commodity chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia margins showed continued weakness.","Turning now to the third quarter of financial results as shown on Slide 4; Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings were $9.6 billion, a decrease of $760 million from the third quarter of 2011. Earnings per share for the quarter were $2.09, down $0.04 from a year ago.","The corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.","CapEx in the third quarter was $9.2 billion, up 7% from the third quarter of 2011. Our cash generation remained strong with $14 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the third quarter 2012, cash totaled $13.3 billion and debt was $12.4 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $18 billion to $13.3 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.","Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $8 million and shareholder distributions of $7.6 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash by $3.1 billion, primarily due to the redemption of the SeaRiver deferred interest debentures.","Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segment results; Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings of $9.6 billion decreased $760 million or 7% from the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower gains from asset sales and lower upstream volumes, partly offset by higher refining margins.","Upstream earnings decreased $2.4 billion, while downstream earnings improved by $1.6 billion. Chemical earnings were down $213 million and corporate and financing expenses were favorable by $263 million, primarily due to tax items. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remained at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","As shown on Slide 7, Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings decreased by $6.3 billion compared with the second quarter of 2012, mainly due to lower gains on asset sales.","Moving next to third quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 8; we continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. In Nigeria, the Satellites Phase 1 project continues to progress towards first oil in the fourth quarter of 2012. Drilling has commenced on two of the three platforms. The project will have a peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day.","The Kearl Initial Development Project is now 98% complete and phased startup activities are underway. Mining operations have commenced and ore is being stockpiled adjacent to the ore processing plant. Commissioning of the ore processing plant and utility systems are progressing and the diluent and natural gas supply systems are operational.","Construction is also progressing at the Papua New Guinea LNG project which remains on schedule for a 2014 startup. In the third quarter, we completed both the hydro testing of the 250 mile offshore pipeline and structural steel construction on the LNG plant trains. Drilling commenced at Hides with the first of two rigs and the final site preparation is underway for the second drilling rig.","Turning now to slide nine and an update on our Gulf of Mexico opportunities. At Hadrian North, we drilled two appraisal wells in the quarter and we are analyzing the results and will incorporate the findings into our development planning. Our current development basis is 100,000 barrel per day capacity, new build semi-submersible floating production system. Exxon Mobil has also begun drilling our Hummer Shallow prospect located in Walker Ridge Block 674 near the Jack St. Malo development.","Also during the quarter Exxon Mobil acquired a 20% working interest in the Phobos prospect which is five miles south of Exxon Mobil\u2019s Hadrian South discovery. Additionally, we acquired a 35% working interest in the foreign prospect located about 30 miles Northeast of Exxon Mobil\u2019s Julia discovery. Phobos is expected to spud by year end 2012 and drilling will begin at Thorn in 2013.","Turning now to our activities in the Black Sea on Slide 10; Exxon Mobil has established the material acreage position in the Northern Black Sea across Ukraine, Romania and Russia totaling approximately 3.5 million net acres.","In August, the Ukrainian Government awarded the offshore Skifska Block to a group of investors led by Exxon Mobil. Our bid combined the extensive deepwater experience, technological expertise, financial strength and the environmental protection capabilities of Exxon Mobil, Shell and OMV Petrom with the local expertise of the National Oil Company, Nadra Ukrainy. Exxon Mobil will be the project operator and we are currently negotiating the joint operating agreement and production sharing agreement.","In Romania, where we had a discovery earlier in the year, we are preparing to commence additional 3D seismic acquisition in late 2012 and have begun preparations for additional exploration drilling in late 2013 or early 2014.","In the Russian sector of the Black Sea processing of the newly acquired 3D seismic is underway. We will be utilize this information to develop our exploration drilling plans with drilling targeted to begin in late 2014 or early 2015.","Turning to Slide 11, during the quarter, we continue to progress our strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft. We recently completed acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic surveys in the Kara Sea. In addition, geotechnical and oceanographic data were collected of potential drill well locations. Following completion of prospect definition and permitting, exploration drilling is expected to begin in the 2014, 2015 timeframe. ","To advance Arctic drilling technology, we've signed an agreement in September to evaluate concepts for the development of a gravity based shallow water rig that can withstand extreme ice, wind, wave and temperature conditions. The structure will be designed to be installed on the seabed, refloated and moved to multiple drilling sites. Studies have commenced on the state-of-the-art design, which could significantly increase the safety and efficiency of expiration in the Kara Sea. ","On shore West Siberia, we are developing a work program for selective Rosneft license blocks which will include geological studies and drilling, with drilling planned as early as next year. A pilot program will determine the technical feasibility of developing these tight oil reserves. In support of these exploration activities, Exxon Mobil and Rosneft have been conducting technical studies on areas of interest, including visits to existing field and facilities. ","Moving on to slide 12, we also continue to focus on high potential, liquids-rich, unconventional opportunities in North America, highlighted by activity in the Bakken, Woodford Ardmore, and Western Canada. In the United States, approximately two-thirds of our operated rigs are drilling liquids-rich opportunities, up from about 20% at the beginning of 2011. On September 20, Exxon Mobil and its subsidiary XTO Energy announced the signing of an exchange agreement with Denbury to acquire 100% of their Bakken shale assets, which consists of 196,000 net acres in North Dakota and Montana, and production is expected to be more than 15,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day when the deal closes. ","The agreement will increase Exxon Mobil holdings in the Bakken region by about 50% to nearly 600,000 acres, resulting in a significant presence in one of the major US growth areas for onshore oil production. Additionally, this acreage is located close to current XTO development areas generating further efficiencies. The Woodford Shale and the Ardmore basin of Southern Oklahoma comprises our most active unconventional drilling program with 10 operated rigs delineating and developing more than 260,000 net acres of leaseholds. ","In addition, we are advancing infrastructure projects to optimize the liquids-rich production from this area. For example, construction was recently completed on a 117 mile natural gas gathering pipeline from our operations of Southern Oklahoma to processing facilities in North Texas. In Western Canada, Exxon Mobil announced an agreement on October 17 with Celtic Exploration in which Exxon Mobil Canada will acquire 545,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Montney shale, 104,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta.","Current gross production on the acreage to be acquired is 72 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, and 4,000 barrels per day of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids. These new assets will complement our existing North American unconventional portfolio. Our financial and technical strength will enable us to maximize resource value by leveraging the experience of XTO Energy which has expertise in developing tight gas, shale oil and gas and coal bed methane.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 13; upstream earnings in the third quarter was $6 billion, down $2.4 billion from the third quarter of 2011. Realizations decreased earnings by $130 million due primarily to lower crude oil and US natural gas realizations, which declined by $2.31 per barrel and $1.40 per thousand cubic feet respectively. Production mix and volume effects negatively impacted earnings by $700 million, due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes base decline and down time partly offset by the ramp up of Angola and Nigeria projects.","All other items primarily lower gains from asset sales and unfavorable tax and foreign exchange effects decreased earnings by $1.6 billion. Upstream after tax earnings per barrel for the third quarter of 2012 were $16.39.","Moving to slide 14, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 7.5% from the third quarter of last year, due to the impact of base decline, lower entitlement volumes, divestments and down time. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp up of projects in Angola and Nigeria. Excluding the impacts of the entitlement volumes, OPEC quarter effects and divestments, production was down 2.9%. ","Turning now to sequential comparison starting on slide 15; upstream earnings decreased by $2.4 billion versus the second quarter of 2012. Higher crude oil and US natural gas realizations positively impacted earnings by $340 million. As crude oil realizations increased by $0.77 per barrel and US gas realization increased $0.54 per thousand cubic feet. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $540 million due to base decline, down time, lower entitlement volumes and seasonal demand in Europe. Other items including lower gains from asset sales and higher expenses decreased earnings by $2.2 million. ","Moving to slide 16, oil equivalent volumes were down 4.6% from the second quarter of 2012 due to down time, base decline, seasonal demand in Europe and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Angola. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes OPEC quota effects and divestments production was down 3.6%.","On slide 17, we showed the year-to-date 2012 volumes associated with the expected 3% full year decline provided at the analyst meeting in March. Operational performance through the third quarter was slightly below forecast, reflecting the timing of work program execution, duration of down time events, particularly in the North Sea and the efficient use of capital in Iraq which is lower net volumes. Additionally, the continued focus on enhancing profitability through the shifting of North American drilling to liquids-rich opportunities has contributed to the variance. ","While the year-to-date Brent crude price of $112 per barrel is near the basis of our March Analyst meeting outlook, prices in the first half of 2012 mostly notably in February through April were higher than our outlook, which negatively affected volumes due to both permanent and price related entitlement. Fourth quarter volumes will be supported by seasonal demand, project startups and completion of schedule downtime.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 18. Downstream earnings in the third quarter were $3.2 billion, up 1.6 billion from the third quarter of 2011, as we continue to optimize our refineries by fully utilizing operational and fleet flexibility and the integration with lubes and chemical. ","Improved margins mainly in North American and European refining increased earnings by $850 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $20 million, due to lower earnings associated with asset sold largely offset by favorable refining optimization effects. Other items included a gain on the sale of our downstream business in Switzerland, favorable ForEx and lower operating expenses increased earnings by $780 million. ","Turning to slide 19, sequentially third quarter downstream earnings decreased by $3.5 billion. Improved margins primarily in refining increased earnings by $650 million. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by lower plan maintenance and refining optimization activity increased by $300 million. Other items reduced earnings by $4.4 billion, primarily due to the absence of a gain associated with the Japan restructuring, partly offset by the gain from the sale of our downstream business along with favorable ForEx and lower operating experience expenses. ","Moving now to the chemical, financing and operating results and starting on slide 20, third quarter chemical earnings was $790 million, down $213 million versus the third quarter of 2011. Margins decreased earnings by a $150 million namely due to lower olefins, and polyethylene utilization. Other items decrease earnings by $60 million, mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. ","Moving to slide 21; sequentially third quarter chemical earnings decreased by $659 million. Weaker margins mainly in Europe decreased earnings by $90 million. Other items, primarily the absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring, decreased earnings by $590 million. ","Moving to slide 22, Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter financial and operating performance reflects the value of our integrated business model and other competitive advantages. We earned $9.6 billion, generated $14 billion in cash flow, invested $9.2 billion in the business and distributed $7.6 billion to our shareholders. ","As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparallel global integration. Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ","That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","","I've got a couple please, one-on-one follow-up I should say. I understand at the Analyst Day you gave as an indication that production would be done this year but it seems that it\u2019s slicing a little harder than certainly we expected and at the same time the capture rate that is you know as the earnings against your weighted revenues has deteriorated somewhat this quarter. So I am just wondering if there's, that you still feel confident in the medium-term outlook and if you have something unusual in this quarter in part to the earnings capture and I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please.","David Rosenthal","Let me first address Doug the volume decline. As I mentioned in the chart, my prepared remarks, we are only slightly below what the outlook would have generated if not for again as I mentioned the price and entitlement effects of the higher crude prices earlier in the year and some divestments. I will say that when you look at the slight underperformance if you will on the operation side, a piece of that effect, a big piece of that bar is the fact that we've been able to generate the production volumes that we were looking to get in Iraq with less capital being expended. So because we expended less capital and we are more efficient. We didn't get as many barrels back. ","We've also had some extended downtime a little more than we thought particularly in the North Sea and some other areas but other than that just some timing and some work program and some of the other things I mentioned but other than that we are pretty much online with what we were looking at. ","If you are looking at the capture rate in particular in the upstream, I think the biggest driver there of course is going to be the mix of the volumes that we had and where we had some of that downtime across the quarter in Kazakhstan and some other areas that we had some downtime North Sea, etcetera, other than that when you look at the other earnings effects not a lot in there in terms of items other than the fact that we were about a billion less quarter-over-quarter, this quarter on asset divestitures. So I think if you sort those things out, we're pretty much as we would have expected to be.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Great. Thank you. My follow-up there is hopefully fairly quick. There is always been a lot of other deltas this quarter, the other items that you talked about but again, just like last quarter, they are not as big but they are still fairly sizeable particularly in the downstream. So I guess there is two points to my question. The first one is, would you be able to quantify the absolute impacts of the major parts from disposals in the foreign exchange effects as opposed to the relative impact and this is an observation. At what point, or what is the philosophical reason for not providing the absolutes on a quarterly basis because it would be extremely helpful if you were able to do that?","David Rosenthal","Doug, let me have a couple of those. First of all, foreign exchange is one that\u2019s impossible to give an absolute because you got both changes and impacts on your working capital balances. Those are specific. But when you are looking at the impacts on the earnings, it's really just a translation of margins and OpEx using exchange rates last quarter and this quarter. So you don\u2019t have an absolute amount on that. ","If we look across the corporation though, I will tell you that quarter-to-quarter, the impact was very small and I am happy to talk about the details. If we go specifically to the downstream earnings, I think which is one you are interested in, if I am looking at downstream earnings, third quarter of \u201812 versus third quarter of \u201811, again you saw the nice margin bump there of $850 million that\u2019s really clean, there is no lag effects or other things in there. We were just able to have all of our operations running strong and take advantage of the strong market that we saw there. ","On a $780 million, if I move over to the other column, I am happy to give you some additional color there. The biggest part in there was about just under $400 million for our divestments in the quarter favorable FOREX quarter-versus-quarter was another $300 million and the balance was favorable OpEx and that pretty much takes that out. Volume pretty minimal where we lost volumes in some of the divested assets we were able to make up those earnings by higher volumes and throughput and some of our other operations.","Operator","Your next question will come from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, I just have a question related to the Celtic acquisition in the quarter and does this deal reflect any change or evolution in Exxon\u2019s view of potential Canadian or British Columbian specific LNG export potential with your bigger Montney position now?","David Rosenthal","I don\u2019t think it changes any of our views or thoughts we have going forward. The Celtic acquisition gives us an opportunity to pick up as I said about 545,000 net acres in the Montney that most of that acreage is near acreage we already have. So it\u2019s very helpful to us. And it\u2019s just a continuation of what you have seen for the last couple of years where we have taken advantage of opportunities to go out and acquire large tracks of promising acreage with high upside potential and both goes on to the XTO acquisition and in particular, I think what you have noticed over the last year or so is these acquisitions have tended to be more liquids-rich properties than the gas things that we added early on. So no change, I will say though that of course this gives us tremendous opportunities across North America, all of which we are looking at and as you mentioned.","I think we mentioned before that we are in the early stages of assessing potential export options from Alaska from Western Canada and from the US Gulf Coast. So we are fortunate to have large resources in each of those areas and again as we develop our plans and go forward, I will have to more to say about that. But I would say it\u2019s really a continuation of the strategy that we\u2019ve had in place now for the last couple of years.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","That's great, and may be just one other follow-up if I may to those question, I mean on relating to upstream volumes. Can you quantify or discuss the turnaround activity [legacy] contributed to what\u2019s your defining lower operational performance and I guess specifically and I guess your comments that may not but just confirm that does not or you don\u2019t see that extending into the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll leave it to that things?","David Rosenthal","Sure, if you look at, I think the best place to look at really where we see any impact of this downtime. If you look quarter-on-quarter, third quarter of \u201812 versus third quarter of \u201811 over in the net growth where we have the minus 125 about 40 of that is downtime across the number of areas most of its scheduled, you are well aware of we had some downtime at Qatar, Alaska and the North Sea and so that impact showed up there.","You also see it, particularly if you are looking sequentially because as you know a lot of this downtime is seasonal, but the downtime effect between the third quarter this year and the second quarter of this year was about 90 KBD. So a significant effect; most of that production is pretty much back-up. We do have some continued downtime and operated by other\u2019s properties in the North Sea, but other than that the rest of the production is coming up as we would have expected heading into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","","A couple of quick ones from me. One, your US natural gas volumes declining quite considerably sequentially, I'm wondering if there's any anomalous items in there and of course we had hurricanes, I wouldn't have thought you would have been disproportionately exposed to that, what can we assume for a say normal decline rate in your US natural gas volumes going forward?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, if you look sequentially at our US gas I mean we had a little bit of impact from weather related activity, but it wasn\u2019t large. You did see a decline sequentially of about 5%. Some of that was downtime, but the majority of it was kind of base decline and really the impact you are seeing as we are shifting rigs from drilling primarily gas plays to drilling liquid focused plays. And so the total rig count is down across the year and the proportion that's drilling liquids rich plays versus gas has gone up and so I think between that and some downtime that really accounts for the bulk of the reason we are down. As you look forward, I really don't have an outlook for you. It will be dependent on how we bring things along in the market and that sort of thing, but clearly you are seeing the impact of our changing focus from drygas to liquids rich opportunity.","Robert Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","And then a conceptual one from me on M&A; your recent North American focused transactions have of course further increased your upstream weighting of capital employed to North America. Your US weighting alone was I think 46% in the upstream capital employed at the end of last year. Looking at future acquisition possibilities conceptually does Exxon Mobil apply any limit to the capital you plan to deploy to North America or would you continue to look at potential North American M&A the same way you look at opportunities globally?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me step back, that's a good question. As we step back and look at our total capital budget and where we put our CapEx, we really don't have any limits in terms of type of resource or geographic focus. We pursue all of the attractive opportunities that are out there. As you look across the last several years you tended to see us sometime putting more CapEx into oilsands or unconventional plays or LNG, but all of that is really reflective of the opportunities as they are presented and our ability with our strong financial strength to basically take advantage of anything that's out there that's on offer that we think will provide shareholder value.","As you've seen over the last couple of years, the bulk of that has been through internally generated CapEx, but there's also been some selective acquisitions and so I would say going forward you'll see us continuing to do what we've been doing, which is to look at all the opportunities that are out there on offer and taking advantage of any opportunity we have to really enhance the portfolio of our assets with the focus continued on the long term, you know, if you look at all the things we've been doing over the last couple of years, they are all focused on bringing really long term legacy projects up and get them running and then continuing to add to our resource space, our opportunities for the future. So I wouldn't see anything different going forward than what we've been doing; but we will continue to look for attractive opportunities wherever they present themselves.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Terreson with ISI.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Some of the global competitors are indicating that global oil demand maybe gravitating lower again and on this point, given your global perspective, I wanted to see if you could provide insight into some of the demand trends that Exxon Mobil is seeing around the world and specifically whether you guys are witnessing any deterioration in this area?","And then second, just for Exxon specifically, R&M was clearly strong in the quarter, but the company didn\u2019t seem to benefit to the degree that some of the competitors did and while you talked about some of the cost factors a minute ago, was there anything unusual on downtime, either planned or unplanned that affected results and if so do you have any quantification in that area?","David Rosenthal","Let me start at the first one there with the global oil demand, I don't think we're seeing anything different than what others are seeing and what you're reading in the press in terms of demand particularly say in Europe and Japan and some other areas. We\u2019ll be putting out our own update here in December on our view of global oil demand, but, again from our perspective, I wouldn't have anything to offer any different than what you are seeing out there, what you are talking about.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Okay.","David Rosenthal","The R&M results, as you mentioned, were really strong. Again, I have to say, you know, we were able to have very good operations up time able to take advantage in particular in the U.S. of the discounted feeds, both heavy Canadian feeds as well as WTI linked crude and so we are optimizing those across our Mid-Continent refineries and you are seeing some of those impacts showing up in the bottomline. If you are looking at downtime, I think it was the rest of your comment in the downstream?","","Doug Terreson - ISI","Yeah, was it unusual in the period?","","David Rosenthal","You saw a little bit more in the second quarter and less in the third quarter as we came out just to give you a little more color, if you were looking sequentially from third quarter of \u201912 on to again, I am sorry the third quarter versus the second quarter, we did see some lower OpEx of somewhere between $100 million and $200 million you would have seen there to the quarters and that would have helped that. But again, the bulk of the earnings driven by good operations and favorable margin impacts.","","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll hear from Allen Good with Morningstar Investment.","","Allen Good - Morningstar Investment","Just a question on the M&A; obviously you mentioned some of the activities you have had relatively probably a little bit more than some of your competitors off late. Can you talk a little bit about the characteristics that Exxon looks at when you go out there and survey those market opportunities that are out there and some of the things that may be you have learned from XTO since acquisition as far as what may be the better plays or any sort of knowledge you have gained from XTO that helps you to better delineate on those market opportunities as far as acquisitions go?","","David Rosenthal","Yeah let me, I\u2019ll actually start with your second question and back up in to the first. Clearly, one of the synergies that we anticipated getting with the XTO acquisition that have been realized in the last couple of years is the ability to utilize the expertise and now as they had combined with some of our technology advances to better analyze and evaluate properties that are out there.","And you\u2019ve seen that, if you look at some of the acquisitions we made in the U.S. of properties and some of the deals we have done elsewhere and up in Canada, a lot of the ability to properly evaluate the resource potential of those properties and assign value to them stems from directly from the organization that came with the XTO acquisition and that is working just as we had planned.","As you look at M&A or any other resource opportunity capture, we look for the same thing in all of them. We do have a high quality large resource with upside potential; that has to be number one. Do we think we can bring some synergistic value to those reserves and perhaps get a better return than someone else could and that comes from either technology that we bring to the table, R&D work or operational expertise that allows us to then again get a better value for that and they might otherwise would have. And then we look for other more obvious synergies around contiguous properties to what we have or other ways of filling in a portfolio to perhaps be able to pursue a larger strategy. So M&A versus outright capture of these resources, the criteria for us remains the same and we really don't differentiate between the two.","Allen Good - Morningstar Investment","And then just second question, could you update us on the North America rig count. I believe you were close to 250 in the last quarter and you Don mentioned that I think over half of it is in liquids-rich place, are you continuing to move drilling away from dry gas at this stage.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, as we look to cross the quarter we ended at about 50 rigs. We are probably close to that today maybe a rig or two less as we speak, and two-thirds of those rigs are drilling the liquids-rich opportunities and in particular I mentioned the Woodford Ardmore is an area of high activity for us, the Bakken of course, an area of high activity and the Permian is another area of high activity for us. So you do see this shift going into the areas that are more liquids-rich. As you go forward without giving any specific counts, you could expect to see us continuing to pursue those liquids-rich opportunities particularly in the areas that I mentioned, but I don't have a specific outlook for you in terms of total rig count going forward.","Operator","Next we will heal from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","","You briefly mentioned LNG and I was hoping you could maybe give us an update on where you stand in the application process out of the US Gulf Coast and then maybe more broadly you kind of mentioned the potential from Western Canada, Alaska. Could you maybe rank order where you see the best opportunities if possible, I know its early days yet but.","David Rosenthal","Sure, let's start with the Golden Pass opportunity that we are assessing. We did early in October, we received authorization from the US Department of Energy to export domestically produced natural gas as LNG from Golden Pass to nations that have existing Free Trade Agreements. So we do have that approval in hand. I can also tell you that we have recently filed an application with the US Department of Energy to explore LNG to non-FDA countries, and we will see how that application process proceeds. ","I have to say that when we look at all of these activities, they really are all in the early days and no decisions have been made. Again, we are very fortunate to have a material high quality gas resource in both the US Gulf Coast and in Western Canada and Alaska, and it would be way premature to try to rank order those other than to say they are all high quality resources for us and we are looking at all of the options available to monetize those resources including again early days on assessing the viability of LNG exports from anyone of those three regions.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Yeah, fair enough. The second question was on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, as I understand that you had formed maybe a JV with a smaller EMT player to target I guess a deep oil play similar to what some of your peers are doing on the gas side for deep gas. I'm just curious if you had any updates on that, and if I'm not mistaken there was going to be a well [spun] toward the end of the year.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, I don't have a specific update with regard to that joint venture. We do have that transaction as was publicly discussed, but I really wouldn't have any update particularly near term on what our activities are going to be on that. And I'll just mention though if you look across the broader Gulf of Mexico, you do see a nice increase in activity as we continue to develop some of these properties that we have captured over the last couple of years ","I mentioned some of those in our prepared remarks and we're very excited about getting some of these wells down and continuing to broader exploration phase, which as you mentioned, has a number of partners and a number of structures but all in a very good opportunity for us and one we're pursuing pretty quickly.","Operator","The next question will come from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Just a few follow ups on some of the North America type question. So you have been pretty clear you pulled back on some of the gas drilling in the US and we saw a little bit of that decline show up. When you kind of slow down the drilling in unconventional, the decline is going to be pretty precipitous. So just wondering maybe the follow up to the earlier question, you know, is 5% just the beginning of what could be a more rapid decline in your gas production or is there something that is not fully apples-to-apples about this decline and it won't be as bad or worse going forward?","David Rosenthal","I don\u2019t have a specific outlook for you, Arjun, but I will note that there are a number of factors in addition to just some of the shifting of these rigs. We did have some downtime in the quarter, and if you look at this year versus last year, you will recall we did have some asset sales last year and we're seeing a little bit of that. But again, if you look just over the couple of last quarter in particular, downtime and then just normal decline associated with this, but I don\u2019t have a decline rate for you or go-forward in outlook. We will see how things go. I will tell you, in some areas, we've been actually able to keep the volumes flat, while reducing the rigs due to efficiencies we have gained, rates of drilled wells and that sort of thing. So we have been able to offset some of this decline in rigs with some improved operations and productivity.","","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","In terms of the shift Dave to liquids-rich would you say you have made the shift now or is there still more gas rigs to come out of the rig count?","","David Rosenthal","What you will see as we\u2019ll continue to have this focus on the liquids-rich place exactly how many more rigs might move I don\u2019t have a specific number for you. We do have contractual obligations that we have to meet and other commitments which will keep us drilling some dry gas wells, but we evaluate this thing on an ongoing basis literally day-to-day and month-to-month in terms of how we optimize the rigs we have available to us, what the market is generating, or how the wells are performing. So I really wouldn\u2019t have a forward look for you.","","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","And Dave may be just lastly on the same topic, clearly you are increasingly are some liquids-rich, you mentioned the Permian, the Bakken some of these places. In terms of having that show up visibly in your US liquids oil volumes, I\u2019m going to assume there is some lag for that to happen none that you can comment on that at all?","","David Rosenthal","You are seeing that show up in the liquids volumes as some of this ramp up; and again most of what we have been doing in these areas for the last several months is been delineating what we have, appraising what we have been doing, looking at what the optimum parameters are for developing thee fields. So now you are starting to see us ramp up on the production side particularly in the Bakken where we are up, I think just under 50% year-on-year if you look at the third quarter. So you are starting to see some of that. ","You will start to see some of that in the other areas as well; the Woodford Ardmore for example and the Permian as we continue to move into more of a development mode. So I don't have the number for you other then to say yes, if you look at those fairly small declined rates on US liquids, you are seeing the impact of normal decline on our conventional field being offset somewhat by ramp ups in some of those other areas.","I will say, if you take out the Alaska and just look at the lower 48, our liquids volumes are actually up quarter-versus-quarter and sequentially. So, some of that downtime is masking some of that performance.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Faisel Khan with Citi Group.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","I want to go back to the production outlook for a second. In your analyst meeting, you guys discussed how production capacity will grow at some blade through 2015, and given your comments around decreased drilling of national gas in US also so that matter decreased investment in Iraq and potentially an exit from southern Iraq and I am just trying to figure out how does this impact your future production capacity gross targets, and to that reserve replacement too?","David Rosenthal","First of all, I don't have a new outlook on the outer years. We are just in the process of pulling our plan together and looking at what the future looks like. I don't have any updates, and of course we will provide an update in March at the Analyst meeting. I will say if you look at all the big projects that we have gone on out there that we've been building for sometime. Those are all in the process of starting up as planned. The projects we had this year in Angola and Nigeria as we look out a little further of course the start up of the Kearl project and then as we move into the following years the Banyu Urip project in Indonesia and all the other launch projects Papua New Guinea LNG (inaudible) Gorgon, all of those projects that we got still going in the ground, all of those are still in the plan and that portfolio remains very strong. So I don't have an update around on that. And the second part of your question Faisel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Yeah David on Southern Iraq, I mean what are your plans in the country?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, if we look at Iraq, the comment I made was we are now producing right at about 430,000 barrels a day of oil right on plan and the good news is strictly that we've been able to do that a little more efficiently than we had expected but I don't have any other update on Iraq other than that. We continue to work and continue to meet our contractual commitments.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Just one last question, on your chemicals business, on the expansion of your Singapore facility can you give us a status update on that and what (inaudible) facility is operating, its up and running and if you are moving products into the markets.","David Rosenthal","Sure. The simple answer would be yes to all three of those questions. The project is nearing mechanical completion and as we talked about before several of the various pieces of that project have been progressively starting up. We were able to produce for example metallocene based polymers here earlier in the year. We do have product qualification activities underway for those products. So the overall project is coming right along. The very last project to reach mechanical completion is the steam cracker and we do expect completion of that by year end. ","So we would certainly expect to be mechanically complete and on track for starting that large investment up and moving that product into the market. So the project is doing well. The Asia Pacific area as you well know is kind of looking at bottom of cycle margins right now. Not surprisingly that remains a cyclical business and one of our strengths has been for a long time investing through these cycles with very strong a year or two ago, it\u2019s weak now, this project as you can well imagine is really designed for the long-term while we remain very bullish on growth in that part of the area. ","So the long-term view remains the same. The project is on schedule to start up and to be mechanically complete by the end of the year and then we will progress the ramp up of that as we go through the first part of next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Two quick ones on Celtic if I may, as I'm sure you saw the Canadian government recently vetoed a purchase by another operator of a domestic oil & gas company. Any concerns about getting approvals for the Celtic purchase?","David Rosenthal","Our approval process is the same as everyone else\u2019s and we are progressing through that. We have a long history of operating in Canada. We've been there a long time and we are looking forward to getting through the approval process and closing on that deal and moving forward with our plans for those resources.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay and assuming the deal goes through and given what you said about curtailing dry gas drilling across North America, is it safe to say that you would pull back on the current, relative to the current level of drilling activity across Celtic\u2019s acreage?","David Rosenthal","I don\u2019t have any outlook today on exactly what specifics we would be doing with that once the deal closes. The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. So it would be premature for me to make any comments about our plans going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will hear from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Just two quick earnings questions. If I turn to slide 15, this is the upstream sequential 3Q to 2Q. Obviously there is a $2.2 billion negative other and $1.1 billion of it is assets sales but can you give us some color on to what the other $1 billion is in terms of the changes, for downstream, that\u2019s helpful.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, if you're looking at this sequential, this is the sequential that you're looking at.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah, 2Q versus 3Q.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, there are couple of other factors in there. OpEx is a negative $200 million, foreign exchange is a negative $100 million and then the combination of asset sales and tax items is about $1.8 million. And the main driver of the OpEx and tax related, we did have the change in the UK tax but if you roll it all up, just think about OpEx a couple hundred million, FOREX $100 million, taxes a $100 million in the balance in the asset sales and tax items.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And those tax items were, were any of those deferred whether it was ongoing? ","David Rosenthal","Yeah, some of those were deferred.","","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then just on the chemical business in the US, obviously Baytown had some disruption in the first half I guess 3Q was it been a good result, is that a fair kind of run rate for the macro conditions that we are in Q3 or were there any disruptions in the US portfolio for chemicals?","David Rosenthal","No, we didn\u2019t really have any disruptions of any consequence kind of normal operations and nothing really to speak off kind of like the downstream; our chemical operations ran well in the third quarter and no major items.","","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","","And then coming to my question on cash and buybacks etcetera, obviously [Europe] your ending cash at the end of the quarter was lower than the beginning of the quarter because $14 billion of cash flow doesn\u2019t cover the dividend plus buybacks plus the spent on this large mega projects. Are you comfortable to let cash balances fold or is this some kind of statements about the future cash earnings power of Exxon as these big projects come on which means that ultimately this level of buybacks is appropriate?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, I think the first thing I will note Ed is that we did spend $3 billion of our cash when the SeaRiver debentures matured in the quarter. So that was a $3 billion hit there. In terms of overall strategy around cash, no change in our approach there, we maintained sufficient cash to run the operations and keep our flexibility for doing other things in the business but really don\u2019t have any particular change or outlook in terms of cash or debt. We will just optimize that as we go forward depending on business conditions.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will hear from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Cheng - Barclays ","I have pleased for three really short questions. First, on the versus the second quarter, you indicate that production job 39,000 barrels per day due to entitlement, I would assume that's all we need to change in [POV] in some of your project. The question is that do you any major projects about to change their POVs that over the next one to two years?","David Rosenthal","Let me talk about the first one. I will give you a little more color on that 39,000 barrels a day Paul. It was about half was permitted to net interest impacts and the other half was on price and expense, so kind of a mixture there and neither one of having a significant impact. Going forward when we look at near-term production of course the biggest factor for us is the price because that drives how many barrels you get to recover your cost as well as how quickly through the transit. ","So looking forward here particularly near-term, I don't have an outlook number to provide you specific to what the sequential price expend impacts might be but again the biggest factor there is crude price.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Do you have any major project that is above, that potentially could be they move to the next [PR] ratio within the next one or two years, you have the current oil price stay?","David Rosenthal","Paul, I really I don't have any specifics along those lines in terms of our project by project. We will really talk again about the make up of our volumes going forward when we visit with you in March and so I\u2019ll probably just hold any comments about future volume outlooks to that time when we can kind of ramp in the whole story for you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Okay, can you tell us that what is your total share oil production in the third quarter or as of this point and breakout between the oil and gas.","David Rosenthal","If you are looking at our unconventional volumes, you know I don't have a total for you on that Paul or a split between oil & gas, you know I think the important thing is as you are looking at the progress that we are making against some of these improvements we are making year-over-year in the Bakken in particular for example and some of the other areas. I think that the progress we are making in those fields particularly as we transition from delineation and appraisal into more development is probably more important than the absolute production that we are seeing on that and the progress that we are making, but I really don't have a specific number for you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Just quick one, last one, do you have the absolute venue of the after sales (inaudible) in the quarter and also do you have any meaningful inventory gains or price finalization impact for your long haul [barrel] under water in this quarter.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me hit that second question and then I will back up to the first one. If you look at the absolute number in the third quarter, it\u2019s almost zero in terms of all the price timing, price finalization, long haul crudes. We did have a negative effect in the second quarter, but if you look at our absolute results in the third quarter there really wasn\u2019t anything there. And then if you were looking at the absolute value of the divestments in the third quarter, that was about $400 million and the biggest item there was the downstream divestment of our business in Switzerland.","Operator","And next we will hear from Ian Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","I just got a couple of quick questions about your international assets. On Kurdistan, do you want to give us your thinking about the drilling program there and when we should be looking forward to the results etcetera.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, Iain I have to say I really don't have any comments on Kurdistan at all to offer today.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","","Really, but you do have a program going on there.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, like I said I really just don't have any comment on Kurdistan today.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","","Okay. Papua New Guinea, what's the status of the planning for train 3. You obviously mentioned pretty good mentioned from the first two trains. I believe train 3 is in the works that when should we look for FID on that.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me first back up just a second and let you know that our primary focus of course is on our existing projects. That project has come along very well and we are on schedule for startup in 2014 and that's our primary focus. If you look at how we are doing on the exploration side, I think we have a number of opportunities in the area and we have a very active broad explorations program going on. We have had some success this year in the Tingyang well. So that's looking good.","Obviously as we continue to evolve and mature our resource space in the area, we will be looking at options for monetizing those resources and I can\u2019t give you any outlook in terms of when we will make final decisions on any opportunities but we are in the early stages looking up we have, thinking about what we might want to do and I would of course include a potential additional train of Papua New Guinea but all of that will be depending upon the exploration success that we have and how we look going forward but in the meantime, I think the really positive news for the shareholders is the project is progressing and progressing well. And the areas are looking very promising for us.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","Could just comment on PNG, I know you didn\u2019t take up the form out, which also is offering in the exploration areas. Does that kind of indicates, you got enough of PNG or what was you thinking there?","David Rosenthal","I wouldn't want to make any comment on any thoughts or rumors or speculation on deals that we've done or not done. We're looking at a lot of things but again I wouldn't make any specific comment on any particular potential transactions.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","Okay, so the last one. I think you can help me with. West Siberia tight oil what's the kind of structure of the contracts or the agreement there with Rosneft. Are you carrying them through this or what are the kind of, any idea about outlying cost and volumes etcetera?","David Rosenthal","If you are looking at West Siberia, we are as I mentioned looking at, we're already actively studying and what we are going to do in that pilot program, hope to get a well down in the first quarter. In terms of specific details of the commercial arrangements there, probably, premature to be talking about that given where we are in the stage. So I won't be able to help you on that question after all.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","But you do have 30% interest, is that the way it would?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, it\u2019s two-thirds, one-third Rosneft and Exxon Mobil.","","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Mr. Rosenthal, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David Rosenthal","I would just like to thank everybody for your participation today. I know many of you are probably participating under some probably fairly difficult personal situation. So I wish you all the best. In that regard, thanks for the good questions and I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you in about three months. So thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And again that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for participation. Your may now disconnect."],"8743":["Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 27, 2018  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Neil Hansen - VP, IR & Secretary","Neil Chapman - SVP","Analysts","Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jonathon Rigby - UBS Investment Bank","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group","Philip Gresh - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","Paul Cheng - Barclays Bank","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Exxon Mobil's second quarter earnings call. By way of introduction, my name is Neil Hansen. I assumed the role of Vice President of Investor Relations on July 1. I look forward to interacting with each of you and discussing Exxon Mobil's performance and long-term value proposition. That will include ongoing efforts to improve transparency and increase engagement, which we'll continue with the call today.","As you saw with the earnings release this morning and as we will discuss during the call, the second quarter results were well below market expectations. We'll review some of the factors that resulted in that deviation. Although challenging in some regards, it was also a quarter highlighted by significant progress on key near-term priorities, along with a number of notable milestones related to strategic investments across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business lines.","These investments underpin our plans to increase long-term earnings potential and shareholder value as we outlined at the analyst meeting in March in New York. As we've previously announced, part of our commitment to increase engagement is participation in earnings calls by members of our management committee, including participation by our Chairman, Darren Woods, for the fourth quarter and full year earnings review.","Joining me on the call today is Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President of Exxon Mobil. Neil oversees Exxon Mobil's Upstream business. After I complete the review of the quarterly financial and operating performance, Neil will provide his perspectives on the significant progress we made during the quarter and investments that will create long-term shareholder value. Neil and I will be happy to take your questions following a few prepared remarks.","Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation.","I will now move to Slide 3 and start by summarizing a number of developments that influenced second quarter performance, specifically as it compares to what we experienced during the first three months of this year. The Upstream benefited from the higher liquids prices experienced during the quarter. The increase in our average liquids realizations was generally consistent with the changing markers, including the $7.60 increase in Brent and the $5.10 increase in WTI. Upstream production in the quarter was impacted by seasonally lower gas demand in Europe and scheduled maintenance, which was undertaken to support operational integrity.","A 25% growth in tight oil production in the Permian and Bakken relative to the first quarter provided an uplift to volumes as we ramped up drilling activities and secured logistics capabilities in an area that will continue to see tremendous volumes growth. We also achieved a number of significant milestones on long-term growth plans in Guyana, Brazil and Mozambique, which Neil Chapman will discuss in detail later on the call this morning.","In the Downstream, seasonal increases in demand and higher levels of industry maintenance resulted in stronger industry-refining margins in North America and Europe. A widening Brent-WTI Midland spread with Permian production outpacing logistics capacity also helped to strengthen refining margins in North America. We safely and successfully carried out a significant level of scheduled maintenance during the quarter to improve operations and strengthen our refining network, partly in preparation of the upcoming changes for the International Maritime Organization standards, related to the maximum levels of sulfur and marine fuels, which will go into effect in the year 2020. Scheduled maintenance had a significant impact on second quarter refining throughput and associated expenses.","The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","In line with our long-term strategy to grow higher-value products, sales of retail fuels and lubricants increased during the quarter. In addition, we expanded our presence in key growth markets like China, Indonesia and Mexico. We also made significant progress on strategic projects in Beaumont, Antwerp and Rotterdam to increase the production of higher-value products, including premium ultralow sulfur fuels and Group II premium lubricant base stocks. While long-term demand fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business, we experienced weaker margins in the quarter as improved realizations were more than offset by higher feed and energy costs. On the other hand, the successful completion of strategic growth projects contributed to higher sales.","Slide 4 provides an overview of earnings for the second quarter. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were approximately $4 billion or $0.92 per share, up 18% from the prior year quarter. The growth in earnings compared to the second quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by the Upstream, moderated by a $0.50 - or 50% decline in Downstream earnings. Earnings declined by 15% from the first quarter of this year with lower contributions from all three business lines. I will start the more detailed review of our second quarter results with reconciliations of the financial and operating performance for each of the business lines relative to the first quarter of 2018, and starting first with the Upstream on Slide 5.","Second quarter 2018 Upstream earnings were $3 billion, a $457 million decrease from the first quarter. Crude realizations rose nearly $8 per barrel or 13% versus the first quarter, while gas realizations were down slightly. Lower seasonal gas demand in Europe contributed significantly to a $180 million negative impact on earnings compared to the first quarter. Downtime, representing the impact on earnings from both lower volumes and increased maintenance spend, reduced earnings by $210 million, largely driven by scheduled maintenance in Canada. Other items, including higher exploration and production expenses, decreased earnings by $190 million. Finally, the absence of the first quarter gain on the Scarborough asset sale contributed to a reduction in earnings of $420 million.","Moving to Slide 6 and a comparison of second quarter Upstream production to the first quarter of this year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.6 million barrels per day. Liquids production was essentially flat versus the prior quarter, while natural gas was down 14% or 238,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Increased downtime mostly related to scheduled maintenance in Canada at Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude, negatively impacted production in the quarter. Lower seasonal demand in Europe accounted for approximately 85% of the change in volumes compared to the first quarter. Liquids growth in the quarter included a continued increase in unconventional Permian and Bakken production and the ongoing ramp-up of Hebron volumes, which more than offset natural fuel decline.","Moving to Slide 7 and a comparison of second quarter Upstream earnings to the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter 2018 Upstream earnings increased by $1.9 billion from the prior year quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by $2.4 million, driven by a $22 per barrel or 49% improvement in ExxonMobil's crude realizations, which was consistent with the change in markers. Lower volumes reduced earnings by $120 million, with unfavorable entitlement effects from the higher prices, partially offsetting growth. Downtime relative to the prior year quarter decreased earnings by $230 million, with impacts essentially evenly split between scheduled and unscheduled downtime.","Impacts from the earthquake in Papua New Guinea was the largest single contributor to the losses from unscheduled downtime. Production in PNG reached full capacity in April, following the earthquake in the first quarter and is now consistently operating above original design capacity. All other items decreased earnings by $170 million, largely due to higher production expenses and increased exploration activity, primarily in Brazil.","Moving now to Slide 8 and a comparison of second quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.6 million barrels per day, representing a quarter-over-quarter decline of 275,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, with liquids down 3% and natural gas down 13%. Lower entitlements resulting from higher prices reduced volumes, as did continued efforts to high grade our portfolio, with the largest impact versus last year coming from the divestment of our operated assets in Norway.","Increased downtime, primarily for scheduled maintenance, also reduced volumes in the quarter with the most significant impact coming in Canada at Syncrude, Cold Lake and Kearl. The decline we experienced in the quarter was in line with our general expectation that base volumes will reduce by 3% each year. However, the more pronounced impact of decline on gas production, in part, represents an intentional near-term effort to focus growth on higher-value production. Thus, we saw a decrease of approximately 12% in U.S. unconventional gas volumes, reflecting minimal investment. This shift to value is also evident in the growth we saw in liquids, which was more than offset - which more than offset decline in mature assets as production in the Permian and Bakken increased compared to the same quarter as last year and production from Hebron continue to ramp up.","Moving now to Slide 9, I will review Downstream financial and operating results, starting first with a comparison of second quarter performance with the first quarter of 2018. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $724 million, a decline of $216 million compared to the first quarter. Refining margins strengthened in North America and Europe, driven by seasonal demand; higher industry maintenance; and for North America, a widening Brent-WTI differential, contributing $630 million to earnings relative to the first quarter of the year.","An increase in higher-value sales contributed a positive $50 million, including an increase in retail fuel sales with additional sites in the U.S., Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg and record quarterly Mobil 1 sales in the U.S. and China. Major plan turnaround activities at SAMREF, Gravenchon, Baytown, Strathcona and Beaumont significantly impacted second quarter results, largely driving the $620 million decline in earnings relative to the first three months of the year. This includes the impact on throughput and related maintenance expenses. Depreciation in the euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $210 million.","Moving now to Slide 10 and a comparison of current quarter Downstream earnings relative to the second quarter of the prior year. Downstream earnings for the quarter were down $661 million compared to the second quarter of 2017. Stronger refining margins in North America contributed to a $260 million increase in earnings, as we were able to successfully capture the benefit of widening regional crude differentials, primarily West Canadian and Permian.","Growth in higher-value sales of retail fuels, again driven by an increase in the retail network in the U.S., Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, combined with record quarterly sales of our flagship, Mobil 1 lubricants in the U.S. and China, resulted in a $100 million benefit to earnings relative to the prior year quarter. Downtime, including both volume and expense factors, resulted in a $620 million negative impact in quarter-over-quarter earnings. This included approximately $375 million from scheduled maintenance activities in Europe, North America and the Middle East to support operational integrity and to strengthen our global capabilities in advance from the change in IMO marine fuel standards. Planned turnaround activities were successfully completed at SAMREF, Gravenchon, Baytown, Strathcona and Beaumont.","A majority of the losses from unplanned downtime were carried over from events that occurred in the first quarter, impacting earnings by approximately $245 million compared to the prior year quarter. These reliability incidents were obviously disappointing, however, repairs are now essentially complete and we are returning to full production. Significantly improved reliability is expected in the third quarter. The depreciation in the euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $240 million. The absence of asset sale gains, mainly related to the sale of our Downstream Nigeria assets and retail assets in the U.K. and Italy in second quarter of last year, led to a relative decrease in the current year earnings of $130 million.","Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results on Slide 11, and starting with a comparison of the current year quarter with the first quarter of 2018. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $890 million, a $120 million decrease from the prior quarter. Weaker margins negatively impacted earnings by $90 million as higher feed and energy costs outpaced stronger realizations. Earnings increased by $50 million compared to the first three months of the year as new assets in Singapore and U.S., combined with the absence of the Yanpet turnaround increased sales volumes. The depreciation in the euro relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $50 million.","Turning now to Slide 12 and a review of the $95 million decline in the current quarter earnings relative to the second quarter of 2017. Weaker margins resulted in a decrease of $210 million as higher feed and energy costs outpaced stronger realizations. Higher product sales improved earnings by $120 million and resulted from the startup of the Mont Belvieu polyethylene expansion and the addition of volumes from the Jurong Aromatics acquisition in Singapore, combined with stronger demand.","Moving now to Slide 13, which provides an overview of key second quarter financial results. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.1 billion, including $300 million in proceeds from asset sales. Second quarter CapEx was $6.6 billion, reflecting continued investments to support long-term growth plans. Including the acquisition of additional interest in the BM-S-8 block in Brazil and the purchase of PT Federal Karyatama, one of Indonesia's largest manufacturers and marketers of motorcycle lubricants. Free cash flow was - free cash flow after investments was $2.7 billion. We distributed $3.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders during the quarter, reflecting a 6.5% increase from the first quarter. Debt into the quarter of $41.2 billion, a slight increase compared to the first quarter, while cash declined slightly to $3.4 billion.","Moving to Slide 14 and a review of 2018 sources and uses of cash. First half earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital, combined with the proceeds of our ongoing asset sales program, yielded $18 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. In line with our capital allocation strategy, cash flow from operations and asset sales fully funded first half investments and shareholder distributions, while also allowing for reduction in debt, further strengthening our industry-leading financial flexibility.","PP&E Adds and Investments and Advancements of $5.4 billion in the second quarter were slightly above the first half trend, again primarily due to discrete outlays in the quarter related to the acquisition of the additional offshore interest in Brazil and the previously mentioned lubricants acquisition in Indonesia. Shareholder distributions of $3.5 billion in the second quarter reflect the 6.5% increase in the dividend.","Finally, the negative change in working capital seen in the first half of the year was driven primarily by inventory build due to the planned maintenance activities and the use of longer haul crudes as we leverage our integrated business to take advantage of favorable economics by exporting WTI-linked crudes to our refining networks in Europe and Asia.","At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President of ExxonMobil, to provide some perspective on second quarter performance and the progress we have made towards the long-term growth strategy we outlined in the 2018 analyst meeting.","Neil Chapman","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Neil, the number one Neil, has provided the details. But I think it will be useful before I get into the progress versus our objectives that we laid out in March to put my perspective on what you just heard from Neil. This quarter was a low point in terms of volumes in the Upstream and Downstream. In the absence of some unknown or extraordinary events, volumes will steadily increase through the second half of the year.","In the Upstream, there are two messages. First, lower volumes in the second quarter versus the first quarter were due to the seasonality of our gas business. So I think you all understand, it is primarily in Europe. That reduction was fully anticipated and was consistent with prior year's quarter-to-quarter variation.","To our Investor Analyst Meeting in March, I said we anticipate our Upstream volumes this year will be roughly in line with 2017. Of course, that was, as I said at that time, absent of price and divestment impacts. Year-to-date, we've indeed seen an impact from price and from divestments. But on our full year basis is the major driver for reduction of our production forecast.","When you combine this with the smaller impacts of unplanned downtime that we experienced in the first half, of course, with the Papua New Guinea earthquake being a significant part of that and the ongoing work to reduce our exposure to the lowest value U.S. gas business, we anticipate 2018 average volume will be around 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. And of course, again, that assumes no change in the current prices and no further divestments that impact volumes.","Going back to reducing our exposure to the U.S. gas business. You saw the impact in Neil's discussion of volumes, but it did not to have a material impact in earnings. As I've commented previously, all volumes are not equal. There is a range of profitability on the volumes we produce. Our focus is on value, and we will continue to upgrade our mix and strengthen our portfolio. In other words, there's no structural change in the Upstream business from the perspective that I provided to all of you in March.","Couple of comments on the Downstream business, downstream and refining business. As you have heard, we had a heavy turnaround in scheduled maintenance in the quarter. The cost and loss of sales from these scheduled outages was large and clearly had the most significant impact on the Downstream earnings. These are planned and were fully anticipated. However, as you know in the first quarter, we had significant losses due to reliability incidents in the Downstream.","Unfortunately, the impact of these continued into the second quarter. We are not happy about it. We're all over it in terms of getting back to our expected reliability performance. We've thoroughly investigated. There's nothing systemic in these incidents. As of this month, these incidents that originated in the first quarter and carried through into the second quarter, they are behind us. Like the Upstream, there's no structural change in our Downstream business. We are on plan in terms of our strategy and the growth plans that we laid out in March. I will provide some details on that in the coming slide. My focus, of course, will be on the Upstream.","So to begin with, a reminder of the five Upstream developments that I outlined at that time. These are key to our midterm growth plans. Our Deepwater projects in Guyana and Brazil, which as I said in March, carry significant upside potential; the transformational opportunity that we have in U.S. unconventional liquids, and of course, that's led by our very strong position in the Permian; and our low-cost LNG opportunities in both Papua New Guinea and Mozambique that we believe will play a key role in capturing the strong growing market demand. These key growth opportunities reflect the strongest portfolio ExxonMobil have had since the merger of our two companies in 1999. They are attractive across a range of prices. They will all begin to produce in the near to the midterm and contribute to our strongly growing Upstream earnings.","Let me start with some comments on the - what I regard as really excellent progress we are making on the Stabroek block offshore Guyana. Estimated gross resources for the block, ending assessment of the latest discoveries, is now more than 4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. And that's up from the 3.2 billion that I communicated in March just 4 months ago. We made the eighth discovery on the block with the Longtail exploration well, which accounted over 256 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone and establishes the turbo area as a potential hub of over 500 million oil-equivalent barrels recoverable. We're currently making plans to add a second exploration vessel offshore Guyana, bringing our total number of drillships on this Stabroek block to three.","The new vessel, we plan that it will operate in parallel to the Stena Carron to explore the block's numerous, high-value additional prospects. The collective discoveries on the block to date have established the potential for now up to 5 FPSOs, producing over 750,000 barrels per day by 2025, the potential for additional production from significant number of undrilled targets and plans for rapid exploration and appraisal drilling. You may remember in the March meeting, I was outlining that we had three FPSOs in our plan and we were looking at a production level of 500,000 barrels per day, so it's a significant increase.","With our ongoing exploration success, we also see an increasing development pace and the potential for increased scope. The Liza-1 Phase 1 project is progressing very well. Pre-drilling at the development well started in May with the Noble Bob Douglas rig. We have batch drilling wells for maximum efficiency, and we've completed the top hole sections on six wells to date and are now working through the intermediate hole sections. Conversion work on the FPSO Lisa Destiny, and that's in Singapore, of course, is progressing well. We remain on track for first oil early in 2020. Liza Phase 2 will be larger, 220,000 barrels per day FPSO. In June, we submitted a draft environmental impact assessment and the development plan for the government's approval. We're targeting start-up of that FPSO in 2022.","The Liza-5 well successfully tested the northern portion of that field and along with the giant Payara field, will support the third phase of development to Guyana. Payara development will target FID in 2019, and we'll use an FPSO designed to produce - at this stage, we see an approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day as early as 2022 - 2023, excuse me. The updated production profile reflects this increased pace of development from what I shared with you in March.","We have a strong focus on partnering with the Guyanese and enabling local workforce and supplier development to support this growth and the success of Guyana's new energy industry. About 50% of ExxonMobil's employees, contractors and subcontractors are Guyanese. A number that will continue to grow as operations progress. ExxonMobil spent about $24 million, with more than 300 local suppliers in 2017. And we've opened a center for local business development in Georgetown, to promote the establishment and growth of small- and medium-sized local business.","Let me turn to Brazil. Offshore Brazil, we completed the purchase of interest in BM-S-8, containing part of the greater than 2 billion barrel pre-salt Carcara field where development planning activities are rapidly progressing. This high-quality development has better than a 10% return at $40 a barrel Brent.","With current drilling in BM-S 8, the Guanxuma well has encountered oil. The preliminary results are very encouraging and, of course, further analysis of this well nature is ongoing with our partners on the block, Equinor, Petrogal and Barra. In Bid Round 15, we were awarded eight deepwater blocks across Santos, Campos and Sergipe basins with exploration activity progressing. And in the fourth pre-salt bid round, we were awarded the Uirapuru exploration block. This is important for us. This block is adjacent to Carcara and we believe offers potential development and production synergies as we move forward. So that leads to our total acreage build offshore Brazil now being 25 blocks, a significant change from what we described in March. We are actively maturing drill well planning for multiple additional wells in the next two years.","Looking at the U.S. We continue to grow our unconventional liquids. Our total net production of liquids unconventional in the U.S. is up 30% year-on-year. In the Permian, we brought over 50 new wells to sales in the quarter, resulting in second quarter Permian production up 45% in the first quarter this year. We now have 34 active operating rigs in the Permian, 17 in the Midland, 17 in the Delaware and six active rigs in the Bakken.","On the completion side, we have 11 active completion and fracking crews in both basins in the Permian and three in the Bakken. We're actively expanding the wind terminal. This is the terminal, of course, that we acquired in late 2017 to accommodate more throughput. We've executed multiple contracts that will enhance pipeline capacity from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We have more than secured liquids evacuation capacity to support growth through 2022. And our Gulf Coast refineries are already processing our production levels and more, capturing the benefits of disadvantaged feed cost.","Additionally, we signed a letter of intent and it was announced in June with plans to develop a 1 million barrel a day long haul crude transport system that will connect the Delaware production to our world-class refining unit and chemical assets on the Gulf Coast. Finally, we've secured offtake for associated gas through 2020, and are in active negotiations for additional capacity. We have no concerns about evacuation capacity, both in gas and liquids for our Permian business.","In liquefied natural gas, we continue to make great progress in Mozambique. The Coral Floating LNG project is progressing on schedule, and the fabrication of the hole is expected to start in the third quarter of this year. For the first phase of the integrated onshore development, the co-ventures have now aligned on two large LNG trains, which will each produce 7.6 million tons of LNG per year. Earlier this month, we announced that the development plan for the first phase has been submitted.","ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operation of the onshore liquefaction on behalf of the joint venture. And our partner, Eni, will lead the construction and operation of the upstream facilities. We're targeting final investment decision in 2019, with the first LNG expected to be online, consistent with what I communicated in March in 2024.","In Papua New Guinea, the recovery from the devastating earthquake continues. As you all know, our facilities stood the event extremely well, and operations have now returned to full capacity. This - the epicenter of this earthquake was right alongside - right adjacent to our facilities up in the Highlands. But our plant already is consistently operating more than 20% above the original design capacity, and we believe this forms a solid foundation to progress our expansions. Our expansion programs continue on plan. We're aligning on a three train 8 million-ton expansion with one new train dedicated to gas from the P'nyang of PNG LNG fields and two dedicated to gas associated with the Papua LNG project.","So finally, I'd like to briefly mention another - a number of other highlights across the businesses that really underscore our progress on pursuing the growth plans that we outlined in March. In the Upstream, we've captured some additional key exploration acreage, Offshore Pakistan, where we signed an agreement to acquire 25% interest in Block G; and in Namibia, we completed the farming agreement to acquire 40% interest in the PEL82 license. Improvements are on track at our large mining operation at Kearl. We anticipate producing 200,000 barrels per day this year as I communicated at the Analyst Meeting. And of course, that's up more than 10% from 2017.","In the quarter, we reached the Heads-of-Agreement with the government and our co-venture partner, Shell, on amended fiscals and production outlook and our gas venture in Groningen, Holland. Qatar petroleum farmed into our Argentina unconventional developments with an agreement to purchase 30% of the equity. Consistent with our focused shift towards U.S. liquids on the unconventional space, we divested some of our U.S. Rockies Gas assets in the quarter, representing around about 20,000 barrels per day oil-equivalent of gas production.","As Neil mentioned in the lubes business, we've purchased FKT. That's a leading Indonesian distributor of lubricants, and it's included a new 700KB lube oil blend plant for blending and packaging of our products. In the fuels business, in the quarter, we reached agreements with Sonatrach for the sale of the 200KBD Augusta refinery and the three associated fuels terminals.","In Chemicals, we announced yesterday that we've begun the operations of our 1.5 million-ton ethane cracker at Baytown. Of course, the associated 1.3 million tons of polyethylene facilities, which are on the other side of Houston at Mont Belvieu, are already in operation. They've been operating on purchased ethylene and are operating at full rates, in other words, at capacity. The cracker startup will enable us to back out these ethylene purchases and replace it with our own ethylene volume.","In May, we announced the creation of a new joint venture with SABIC for a 1.8 million-ton ethane cracker with associated derivatives in polyethylene and glycol. The plan is this will be located in South Texas near Corpus Christi and close to the Permian Basin. Finally, we've completed the startup of our 230,000-ton Singapore Specialties in the Chemical business with production fully online. This contains the world's largest adhesive tackifier units and the world-scale halobutyl plant.","So that's the comments. Neil. I'll hand it back to you, and we'll get into some Q&As.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, Neil. Neil and I will now be happy to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.","Biraj Borkhataria","Neil, best of luck in your new role. And to the other Neil, thank you for returning the call. So my first question was on the downstream. So it does let you impact quite heavily for some unplanned downtime. Hopefully, that's behind you. But could you just talk about the maintenance time for the rest of 2018, whether there's anything significant in either chemicals or refining that we should be aware of? And I've got a follow-up on U.S. gas.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, Biraj. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. And I look forward to interacting with you and talking more about ExxonMobil and our value proposition. So your question on maintenance. One thing that we can say is that we do expect maintenance during 2018 and 2019 to be a bit heavier than normal. Within that, you would expect to see some seasonality, so a bit heavier in the second quarter, coming down a little bit in the third quarter. It's difficult for us to get into specific - mention specific activity at sites. But we can say that given the IMO 2020 change, other maintenance activity that we plan to do over this year and next year will result in a bit heavier activity and then you'll see some seasonality in that. I don't know, Neil, if you wanted to add anything.","Neil Chapman","No, I'd just say I mean I think I mentioned in my comments, I said that we were at a low point in terms of volume in the second quarter. So with that, you'd anticipate the volumes increasing, but it will be a moderate increase and we have a - still a heavy turnaround schedule in the third quarter and not quite as large as the second quarter.","Biraj Borkhataria","Great. That's very helpful. So second, just follow-up on U.S. gas and some of your comments there. But my question was really on timing. You talked about reducing your exposure to lower-value business. But the gas market has been supplied for - well supplied for a number of years now. So I was wondering what drove the decision this year to spend less? Is it just the fact that you're bringing other things into the portfolio or what's going on there?","Neil Chapman","This is Neil Chapman, of course. This is an extraction depletion business as we all know. And so as wells start to deplete, you have choices whether you want to drill more in gas or you want to drill more in liquids. And we believe we have this very strong advantaged position in the Permian, of course. This goes back to the Bass acquisition that we made a couple of years ago. I've mentioned many times since then that we've just seen continuous upside on that liquids opportunity in the Permian Basin. So we have choices to make, and we have priority calls. And what we are doing is we're prioritizing liquids production over gas production. Now when we are progressing our developments in the Permian Basin, it's really important to us that we do this in the most capital-efficient way, which typically will mean drilling a lot of wells on a drill pad and we drill several at a time and then we come in and we frac them up and then we start to evacuate the gas. And that results in, it doesn't result in a steady increase in volumes. It's a little bit lumpy. Some quarters, we get a big increase in volumes. Of course, we had a 45% increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter in the Permian. But sometimes, it's less so, and you're going to see that. And what we're seeing in the first half of the year as we start to focus on liquids and I would say deemphasize somewhat, and I must say somewhat, it's not completely gas business. You've seen - we've seen a lower amount of gas production in the second quarter, first half of the year, and that will be replaced and replaced by some more with liquids in the coming period.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Douglas Terreson","My topic is performance improvement in the upstream. Meaning while it seems like whether because of a higher quality set of opportunities or improvement in process, that the outlook for return in Exxon's 5 key areas of investment is pretty positive. I think Neil made that case. Simultaneously, normalized returns on capital in E&P business declined significantly during the past decade or so. And it seems like there may be opportunities to create value through divestments, too. So my question is with your competitors divesting tens of billions of dollars of assets and either moving on to more productive areas or returning funds to shareholders through repurchases or whatever, also to their benefit, is there a philosophical reason why ExxonMobil hasn't been more assertive in this area? Or would you say stay tuned? So the question's about how you think about value-creation opportunities from underperforming parts of the portfolio?","Neil Chapman","Yes, Doug, this is Neil Chapman. Thanks for the questions, and you probably answered some of it in your question actually. You were referencing back to a comment that I made in March, I have no doubt, where I sort of indicated, and I didn't say it exactly this way, but it was sort of along the lines of watch the space. And what I really mean about that is we have some really strong value-accretive opportunities. And I commented at the time and I stand by this that they are the most advantaged perspective, the best set of opportunities we've had since the merger and the five, I just talked about the progress and I outlined them at the Investor Analyst call. Now - if you have a portfolio in the upstream, it's really important you don't just add. You look through - for the area, look for the businesses and the assets, which don't deliver the same amount of value. And I indicated at the time, we are looking very hard at that, and that is indeed the case. There is certainly no philosophical intent to hang onto assets that are underperforming. It's far from it, Doug. I can tell you that we are very actively looking at our portfolio.","We are actively managing both ends of the portfolio. And I would add to that to tell you that, yes, I really believe strongly we have five great, great assets that we're progressing these big development opportunities. But I'm telling you, if something else better comes along, we're going to progress that as well. At the same time, we're actively managing the other side of our portfolio. And it's a focus that we had in this company now for the last - at least for a long time but even more focused, I would say, in the last 18 months and certainly in the last six months. So I'm not wanting to lead that we have anything coming immediately, but we are looking and we are very, very active. So I think I'll stop there.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas Leggate","Let me also welcome one Neil and - both Neils actually, and second Neil for getting on the call this quarter. Guys, I wonder if I could just start with a comment, and I've got two questions. My comment is the market, looking at the numbers, clearly didn't know or didn't expect the downtime. You guys obviously did.","It would be extremely helpful if you could find some way of signaling to us that these kind of planned events are in your plan for the year to avoid the kind of volatility that we have quarter-to-quarter in your share price. So maybe something to think about. My two questions is, first of all, a follow-up to Doug Terreson's question on disposals. But Neil Chapman, I'd like to get very specific, if I may. There has been a lot of chatter from Qatar Petroleum about sanctioning the Golden Pass project and moving Upstream in vertical integration into onshore gas. So my question to the extent you're able to answer it is, is the Golden Pass sanction in your plans as it stood at the Analyst Day? And could you envisage yourself partnering upstream on your onshore gas production with Qatar Petroleum?","Neil Chapman","Yes, thanks, Doug. This is Neil Chapman, of course. And I'll make a comment on the downtime and the scheduled maintenance on refining. So I think it's a very valid point that you make. And of course, we're taking that into account. And Darren Woods talked about our drive towards increased transparency. And that's really our intent. And so we take your comment. And we will, of course, be looking at it. Okay, in terms of Golden Pass, we never - Doug, we're never going to say exactly when we're going to FID a project. It's a very clear that we're actively involved with our partner QP on that project. The place we're at right now is we've got some initial bids in. We are working those bids and working the opportunity. We will work that opportunity with our partner including the Upstream part of that business. There is an obvious opportunity in that space. I would tell you that we see the demand for liquefied natural gas continuing to grow. We see that the major buyers around the world increasingly look for diversity of supply. And so that's a good opportunity for the U.S. gas business. That's one of the drivers in our Golden Pass project. The other driver is, of course, we have a lot of assets already in place now, so we can leverage that. We think it can be - bring us an advantaged opportunity together. I know you want a specific answer of when we will FID. I can't give you one. All I'd tell you is we're actively working the project with our partner. And as soon as we're ready to FID out, we'll let the market know.","Douglas Leggate","I was actually pressing a bit more on your potential to sell gas assets to QB, but I'll move on. My second question, if I may, is really more of a production growth question as it relates to the guidance you gave us back in March. You'll know it's 34 rigs in the Permian. And that appears to be ahead of your schedule. And Guyana is substantially larger, it seems, than what you provided to us in your guidance in March. I just wonder if you could talk to the - what was happening in terms of the momentum and potentially the scale. And if I can risk an add-on, maybe an update as to how much of Ranger you've actually included in your resource estimate at this point. And I'll leave it there.","Neil Chapman","Yes, thanks, Doug, and thanks for the questions. Look, I'll say what I've said before and I said in my comments I said in March, we're not focused on volume, we're focused on value. And what's really important to me is not the volume outlook for this business, it's the value. Not all volumes as is clearly obvious are created equally. Having said that, what I was trying to indicate in my remarks a few minutes ago, both in the Permian and in offshore Guyana is we have seen considerable upside in a short space of time. I mean, it's only three months, four months since I was up there describing both those opportunities to you. Yes, we are further ahead in terms of drill rigs than we had said at that time. And yes, we have had more discoveries in Guyana than we said at that time. We're going to develop them at the pace that we think is the best in terms of capital efficiency and the best in terms of value. I would tell you that we're not giving any different update in terms of our outlook right now in terms of a total versus what we said in March. But I do want to indicate, and it's clearly obvious from my comments earlier on, that we've seen considerable upside versus what I talked about in March. Going back to Guyana and Ranger, we have some more appraisal wells to go in Ranger. We know we have - we know, of course, from our discovery that we have a considerable resource. We're not at a position where we can quantify that right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS.","Jonathon Rigby","I just want to return back to the issue of performance improvement and actually related to the Downstream. I'm thinking back to the March investor update. It seems to me that the focus was pretty much on adding new capacity, new complexity to move the earnings dial. But would you recognize a comment that would say that over the last sort of 18 to 24 months is the underlying earnings performance of the Downstream, looks like it's been deteriorating, vis-\u00e0-vis competition? And I just wondered whether you felt that the performance of the business as it stands right now can deliver the kind of earnings performance you're expecting over the next 7 or 8 years just by adding the capital that you talked about, and whether this actually quite significant performance improvement also needs to be delivered by that business.","Neil Chapman","Yes, Jon, this is Neil Chapman again. And maybe I'll take that question. I understand why you're asking the question on underlying performance. And I commented earlier on that we're not happy with the reliability performance that we have seen certainly in the fourth quarter, first quarter - fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year and rolled over, of course, into the second quarter. However, I don't recognize at all your comment that this may be signaling some underlying deterioration of performance. It's far from it. We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents. We pride ourselves in this company as being the leader in terms of safety, in terms of reliability, in terms of cost performance in all segments of our business and I would say probably as much as anywhere in the reliability and in the performance of our Downstream business. So no, we do not believe at all.","We think it is as robust and there is no change in that at all. The projects that we discussed in March, let me just - I'm going to correct you a little bit in what you said. I don't regard these as capacity projects. They will bring a little bit of additional capacity. But they are driven about getting more value out of a barrel of oil. That's what we are trying to do. And it's all about upgrading bottom of the barrel, low-margin products like fuel oil into higher-value products. And we highlighted three projects, I believe, when we were with you in March at Beaumont, at Antwerp and at Rotterdam. The Antwerp and Rotterdam expansions, we anticipate, will be up and online in the second half of this year. And that's consistent with what we talked about before. The only capacity that we're adding is capacity that will enable us to refine more light oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast out of the Permian. That is a terrific advantage that we have. We have a refining footprint on the Gulf Coast with some small modifications, particularly at Beaumont, will enable us to purchase - to process more of this high-quality light oil from the Permian, which gives much higher value as we process that versus processing other crude oils. I absolutely understand your concern in your question around reliability.","I can assure you from Darren Woods through myself through all of that leadership of this team, we're all over the reliability issue. Nobody in this organization is going to be happy if we're not meeting plan in terms of reliability. We strongly believe that the big incidents that we really had in the first quarter that rolled into the second quarter, they are all behind us. But I can tell you, there's nobody, nobody is not focused on this. And I'm absolutely confident, we are absolutely confident, it doesn't reflect any underlying deterioration in the capability or performance of our refining assets.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Neil Hansen, welcome. Neil Chapman, thank you for making the time. We appreciate you doing this. Look, I want to start off on the Canadian side of the business. And getting the Kearl up to operational capacity has taken a little bit longer than expected. You outlined a credible plan at the March Analyst Day to doing that. So where do we stand on that effort? And then on Syncrude, there were some unplanned downtime here that you guys are working through. Lessons learned and where do we stand in terms of getting that to where you want to be?","Neil Chapman","Yes, let me start with Syncrude, if it's okay, Neil, and I'll come back to Kearl. On Syncrude, of course, we had this significant outage in June. We're back online partially. We are not at full capacity right now. Obviously, the operator, we're in close contact with them. They're anticipating a return to full production some time in September. This was a significant outage, big power outage, caused a lot of damage. We're back now. It will have an impact - did have an impact on volumes in the second quarter, maybe order of magnitude, 10 KBD, something like that. We'll be back online in September. On Kearl, what I said at the Analyst Meeting in Kearl is consistent and it is still the same today. We are targeting 200 KBD production this year. We are on plan to produce 200 KBD this year. We - in the second quarter, we had some planned outage at Kearl. That is behind us now. Actually, the peak daily volumes coming out of that facility are way in excess of the 200 KBD. But in our mining operation, the key to being successful is ongoing reliability of these operations. We communicated sometime last year, I believe, that we are making an investment in a parallel crusher at Kearl. And why we're doing that is because that's the most vulnerable part of this production. And we feel that once we get that crusher online, that will enable us to make a significant step change in production. We're targeting to get up to 240 KBD in the coming years. That's what I outlined before. We'll get 200 KBD this year. And that's really the outlook on that facility. I mean, I hope it answers your question.","Neil Mehta","No, it does. And the second question, Neil, is more of a philosophical question. You've been spending some more time on the road, which we appreciate. And Exxon has got a unique capital spend strategy. There are a lot of companies that are shifting into harvesting mode right now and restraining capital. And your firm is leaning in and making investments, which should be ROC-accretive. As you talked to the investor community, what's been the initial feedback that you've gotten? And how has that sort of shaped the way that you want to communicate with the investment community?","Neil Chapman","Thanks. And that's a good question. Let me - this is Neil Chapman again. I'll start, and maybe, Neil Hansen, you can add some perspective on cash allocation. The way we look at it is this is if we have value-accretive opportunities that are robust over a wide range of prices, that's the best way to add value to the shareholder. And that is why we have our investment program. And that is why we have the capital expenditure profile that we laid out with all of you, not just at the March meeting. The reason we're doing this is because they're value-accretive businesses, robust over a range of price scenarios. We think that's in the best interest of the shareholders. And remember, I mean, everybody knows this, this is an extraction depletion business. If you don't invest in the Upstream, if you don't invest at all, you've probably got a 6% decline across the business. So it's very important you invest. But it's not just about adding capacity. It's about adding quality capacity. I don't know. You'll have to ask our competitors why they are not investing in new projects. All I can tell you is we have very, very good projects, the best that we've had since the merger. And what I wanted to do, what we wanted to do and Darren wanted us to do is to be very transparent with the investment community on what those projects are, be very transparent in terms of why we're investing in them. We believe they are very value-accretive. And at the March meeting, we even outlaid where we saw the impact that would have on our financial results going forward. I don't know, Neil, have you got anything to add?","Neil Hansen","Yes, Neil, I will say that the feedback we're getting from investors, both formally and informally, is that they're pleased with the capital allocation strategy that we're undertaking, in great part because what Neil just said. So just to reaffirm our priorities for cash, first of all, is, as Neil said, we're looking to invest in projects that are accretive, projects that will create long-term shareholder value for our - over the long term. And if you look at what we showed you at the Analyst Meeting in the Upstream and Downstream, we expect those projects at $60 a barrel to generate 20% return and in the Chemical, 15% return. So as Neil said, this is a set of portfolio opportunities that is probably the best we've had since the Exxon and Mobil merger. So that's our first priority. And again, the feedback we get from investors, they generally support that. Now after we make those investments, we're going to continue to pay a reliable growing dividend. As we mentioned earlier, we increased the dividend by 6.5% in the second quarter. Following dividends, we'll continue to prioritize our balance sheet. We want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, that we have the financial flexibility we need to take advantage of opportunities. And then to the extent that we have cash remaining after those priorities are met, we'll distribute cash through buybacks. We tend to view the buyback program as a flywheel. So really nothing has changed in terms of that capital allocation strategy. And as I mentioned, as we interact with investors both formally and informally, they reaffirm that's exactly what they want us to do.","Operator","Next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","Thanks for the color and the refreshed guidance on the Upstream production for the year. It sounds like there's several different variables you're talking about here, Neil. Could you break down - I mean, it looks like the guidance is basically like a 4% to 5% decline now on a year-over-year basis. Could you give a little break down between those components, how you would allocate that? And then as we look at the improvement you're expecting for the second half of the year, just to clarify, is it basically Canada and Papua New Guinea running better? Or are there other things we should be thinking about?","Neil Chapman","Yes, I mean, listen, I mean, obviously getting Papua behind us has been important. We've had great success at Hebron, which is obviously one of the newest facilities we brought online. And that is continuing to outperform our planned expectations. I would say the biggest growth that we're seeing right now in terms of liquids, of course, is what's happening in the Permian. And some questions earlier on from Doug on that on the number of drilling rigs, and I did say that we are up 45% just quarter-on-quarter. And I think that's indicative of what we're seeing there. Not all volumes are alike in the unconventional liquids space. I mean, I made that point many, many times. I think people tend to draw a broad brush across the whole of our Permian and unconventional and see it as absolutely the same everywhere. I can assure you, it is not. There are more - there are plays that are more productive. There are plays of different quality of oil that are easier to extract and lower cost.","We are very, very happy with what we sit on right now. So I would say the largest increase we're going to see through this year is most likely going to come from the Permian. In terms of putting color on the number that I outlined, I feel it's very important to explain our volume outlook. And again, I really want to make a point, and I will make this over and over again and you'll get bored of me saying it, but volume is not my focus. It's not our focus. Value is our focus. But I understand the interest in volume. And that's why I elected to give you this outlook for 2018 of 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels. I don't see that as a material change from what I outlined in March, I do not. Because the vast majority of the difference comes from what I said before, which is the price impacts on entitlements, which in our business has been quite significant year-to-date, and some divestment impacts. That is the majority of the difference between when I said we will be in line with 2017 versus this 3.8 million number. The other two components are - I'm just not going to get back the production that we lost to Papua New Guinea in the first half of the year. I mean, some of this unplanned maintenance, we're not going to get it all back.","And so that's going to impact us for the year. It's not a big deal, but I think it's important to highlight to you what it is. And that's why I wanted to be quite specific. But I think the only part of this which again is really a very small amount in terms of volumes, and it's not a lot in terms of earnings this year at all, is this movement, this pivot that I did indicate in March and I'm reinforcing now from gas to liquids in the unconventional space in the United States. We purchased XTO, it's a dry gas business. Everybody understands that. And we've pivoted towards liquids. And we're going to continue to pivot towards liquids because it's a more profitable business for us. And what's really, really important to us in this unconventional space is that we can leverage this unconventional experience and capability of the XTO company that we purchased with ExxonMobil's Upstream development company, who are very skilled in taking on large projects. I mean, obviously we've seen at Sakhalin, we've seen at Papua New Guinea. We saw it in Qatar. We've seen it in lots of different places, the combination of having great expertise and capability on major projects. And let me tell you, the Permian liquids is a major project. It's not a lot of small activities. It's a fully integrated major project.","Combine that with our unconventional capability, then I feel like we're in an extremely strong position to develop a high-quality resource. And so that pivot from gas to liquids is really important, not just for the long term but for the mid-term of this business. I would tell you their production profile, I know everybody wants to see a continuous growth quarter-on-quarter. I'm telling it's going to be lumpy. Because the way we are going to do this is we are going to do it in the most capital-efficient manner we can. If that means drilling a whole bunch of wells and then just drilling them and fracking them six months later because that's the way of being capital-efficient, we are going to do that, I can assure you. So it's a little lumpy and it's what we've seen in the first half of the year now. It's my long-winded answer to your question, Phil. But we've seen a dropoff in gas as we've not reinvested as much in the gas business. We've put more of that investment in the liquids in the Permian. And obviously, we would anticipate seeing the results of that in the coming years.","Philip Gresh","I appreciate that. My second question is just around the CapEx in the quarter. You called out some M&A spending there. Just want to get a refresh on your thoughts on capital spending for the full year. And if possible, if you could call out how much of that was the one-time acquisition spend and if any of that acquisition type of spending bleeds over into the third quarter based on some of the activities that you've been undergoing that may not have closed. Just to - I think people may have been a little bit surprised by the spending number. But obviously, there's some specific activities you had underway.","Neil Hansen","Yes, this is Neil Hansen. I think year-to-date, for the first couple of quarters, we're sitting at about $11.5 billion of CapEx. And I think we indicated at the Analyst Meeting that the full year outlook for CapEx is $24 billion. So there's no changes at this time in that number. As you mentioned, sometimes this comes in lumpy, especially as we make acquisitions. And we did have those two discrete outlays in the second quarter. In addition to those two items, as Neil mentioned and consistent with the Permian story, is we are seeing an increase in capital activity out in the Permian. But the plan is really flexible. It depends on timing. So these things can happen in waves during a quarter. But again, no change in plan for the full year.","Neil Chapman","Yes, I think that's right. I mean, there's no change signaled in what we said before.","Philip Gresh","Could you provide the M&A spend that was in the quarter?","Neil Hansen","No, I don't think we want to provide specific commercial terms for those two acquisitions.","Operator","We'll next go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess you made the comment earlier, Neil, about creating value more so than thinking about production growth. Can you give us an idea, given the intensity of activity in the Permian today, the growth profile laid out on Slide 19, when the Permian becomes more of a value-add or a cash flow provider as opposed to a cash flow consumer? Or thinking of capital intensity right now, it clearly would be running underneath the overall Upstream business, when that might flip to the other side.","Neil Chapman","Yes, it's a good question. And honestly, I don't - Roger, I don't want to get into the specifics in terms of just the Permian. Having said that, I mean, I think you can work the math yourselves. You get up to a certain volume profile and it becomes cash additional rather than taking cash away. That's really important. We said we'd have cumulative cash flow at the analyst call of over, I believe, $5 billion between '18 and 2025. That was the outlook we gave at that time. There's no change in that. But I do want to point you back to that volume curve that we showed earlier on. It's been called the green wedge in the industry. But you can see where we are on that green wedge. And I think it's just illustrative of we are on plan. And I've indicated that we are optimistic about achieving that plan and frankly some more. So I really don't want to give you a timing and say by 2021, 2022 or 2019 that we are going to be cash positive in there. I don't think that adds a lot of value, albeit I understand what you're saying. What I would tell you though is don't forget the value proposition that we described on the Permian to the investment community.","Yes, this is an absolutely foundational part of our earnings growth, financial growth plan, value growth plans in the Upstream. It is also very, very important for the Downstream business. I talked earlier on about our ability to process this light crude and how we see that giving us a distinct advantage in margins over the average of industry because of the facilities. We decided, and we made it clear back in March, that we will get engaged in the connectivity between the Permian and our Gulf Coast refining and chemical assets. In other words, we're going to participate sometimes with equity plays in the logistics. We bought the Wink terminal, we've announced that we're talking about a long-range crude pipeline where we'll have equity. I think what's really important here is that everybody understands being on that end-to-end value chain gives us a significant advantage. Now we've all seen the disconnect in Midland versus Cushing, in Midland versus the Gulf Coast on crude in the last quarter.","And of course, a lot of that's driven by - we believe, driven by a tightness on the evacuation capacity of the industry. But if you're processing that crude, you're buying that crude at low value as well, which we just move that value from the Upstream into the Downstream. And when we do that, of course, we're getting more NGLs which our chemical companies benefiting from it. So I think different from most of the competitors in the Permian Basin, that value proposition on the integrated value chain is going to become increasingly important, not just in the Upstream. But we anticipate you're going to see that in the Downstream results. And obviously, the fact that we are making significant Chemical investments, which is all about processing the NGLs, primarily ethane, of course, is another indicator of what we're achieving. So yes, I mean, I know you want an answer on exactly on the cash flow. But I'm going to stay neutral on that. I'm going to tell you no change from what we told you before.","Roger Read","I appreciate that. We've got to try, right? Nice segue for Chemicals. In the quarter, obviously you cited higher feedstock cost, energy cost as a negative for the margins. I was just curious, does that - is that something that looks transitory? Or we should think of that as tied to kind of oil and naphtha prices as that works across maybe some of the global feedstock? Or do you see it as this is what prices have done, and thus this is something that we're just - we need to consider in our forward look for the Chemicals business?","Neil Chapman","I think you should see it very simply as chemical feedstock is primarily based on a barrel of crude oil. And as the crude oil price goes on, as these processes are through the Chemical business has to pass on that increased price, in other words, low margin to the industry - to the chemical industry. So if you go back in history and look at the chemical business during a period, and I'm talking about the industry now, not just ExxonMobil, if you look at a period of rising crude oil prices, chemical earnings tend to lag. In a period of a falling prices, chemical earnings tend to deliver much more. And it's all about the lag in the industry. Now what is different about our footprint is the price of chemicals, primarily petrochemicals, typically polyethylene plastic, which is the bulk of our business, of course, that is set by crude oil and naphtha price in Asia Pacific because that is what sets the majority of the polyethylene feedstock, which is naphtha-based in Asia. Our Gulf Coast refineries are processing largely ethane, which is coming out of the Gulf Coast. So when there is a big disconnect between the gas and crude price.","And obviously, you've seen your Henry Hub gas price has barely moved, but the oil price has gone up significantly in the first half of this year, that is a benefit for anybody who's processing U.S. ethane into chemicals and capturing the price that's been set by crude oil. We've just started up our 1.5 million ton ethane cracker in Baytown. I love the timing of that. It's up now. And we're getting going on that. But also our existing crackers at Baytown, Baton Rouge and Beaumont are processing a heavy percent of ethane, which really captures the way I always like to describe it is this gas-to-crude spread. And when the gas-to-crude spread goes up, then chemical businesses that are processing ethanes and NGLs in North America are going to benefit from that. So one part of the answer to your question is there is a lag in the industry with rising feedstock prices. The other part is if you can capture the benefits of that crude-to-gas spread, obviously that's an advantage in the industry. And quite frankly, Roger, that's why a lot of people are investing in crackers on the Gulf Coast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Welcome, Neil, the Neil, VP on IR. A couple questions, if I may. Neil, for Qatar, any update you can - I mean, that's probably the most profitable Upstream business that you have today. For the LNG, the government has been talking about expansion. We heard some of your competitors, they're talking that they may come to a conclusion by the end of this year and early next year. Is there any update that you can provide? And also along that, I think that most of your existing operation, they have a 30-year contract. And some of the early ones that come onstream, say, back in the year 2000, those will be coming up for renewal pretty soon. Is there any update you can provide?","Neil Chapman","Neil Chapman, Paul. Thanks for the question, and thanks for recognizing Neil's first time on the call. Frankly, the short answer to your question is no, we don't have any update. I think the more expansive answer to your question is we've really got a terrific reputation and relationship with the Qataris. It's been a really important part of our portfolio as you just have highlighted for a long time. And we fully expect and we hope it will be a considerable part of our portfolio in the future. We're well aware of what the Qataris have said publicly. We're well aware of what our competitors have said in terms of expansion opportunities in that North Field. I don't like to talk about our ongoing discussions until we have something public. I don't think it's fair on the resource holder. I don't think it's fair on the competition. But I fully understand why you would like to know. In terms of extension of the licenses, unfortunately, my answer to your question is the same. It would be unfair to talk about our ongoing discussions with QP and the Qataris. Of course, we're talking about both with the Qataris. And I'm sure they would tell you the same thing. Our intention is to continue to maintain a very robust business that brings maximum value to the nation of Qatar, but of course, is beneficial to our shareholders. And I know, Paul, you wouldn't expect me to say nothing else. But I'm sorry, I really don't want to get into the details.","Paul Cheng","Okay. So maybe let me try a different question that perhaps that I have some better luck. Permian and Bakken, you've been doing some pretty long natural well, 12,000, 15,000 feet. I believe that they must be already in production. Is there any kind of data points that you can share?","Neil Chapman","Well, yes. And I know there's great interest in the length of these laterals. And you know what - and I've heard comments in the industry. And frankly, I've heard comments from the investment community on many occasions about saying, \"Well, are these long laterals really beneficial? Are they more capital-efficient? Are they more productive? Do they get more out of the resource base than a shorter well?\" Look, the reality is all unconventional space, all unconventional liquids are different, meaning that in some occasions, yes, it absolutely makes sense based on our experience to drill longer laterals. It's a capital-efficient way. It's the best way of extracting the resource. And yes, we do have some in terms of where we can assess the production rates. And we're very comfortable with what they've done. In fact, they've been very positive results. But I do want to caution you, it doesn't mean to say that we're going to drill 3-mile laterals everywhere.","We're going to drill the lateral length based on the maximum recovery and the best capital efficiency of that resource base. It is really important, I believe, for people to understand that not all of this resource is the same. So I believe our technology is advantaged. I believe that we can drill these long laterals because we have the technology advantage to be able to do that, some can't. What's really important in the Permian is does your acreage allow you to drill these long laterals? If you do not have contiguous acreage, in other words, if you have acreage that's a mile square or a 2 mile square, you cannot drill a 3-mile lateral. You don't have the capability to do it. The acquisition of the Bass acreage, Poker Lake and in the Big Eddy have been really important because it gives us that opportunity to drill those longer laterals. And really, Paul, I would really encourage you to think of it that way. It would be, in my opinion, a significant mistake to try and generalize that resource base. And I would tell you, not just between the Bakken and the Permian or the Delaware and Midland but even within those basins and even within the multiple horizontal plays. Because as you're well aware, there is multiple plays, and we will extract that resource depending on the quality of that resource in different ways. And I know I sound like a little bit of a squeaky record on this, Paul. But that really is what we believe strongly.","Paul Cheng","No, absolutely. I mean, we fully understand it's very different, maybe even from session-to-session sometimes. But I guess, the question then that in the - in your - at least in your acreage position in the Permian, do you foresee that, that 3-mile lateral will be a regular or the average that you're going to push for that, let's say, the [indiscernible] or that is only a small session of your asset in the Permian that you think that is advantageous?","Neil Chapman","Yes, I mean, I would position the way I see it as a tool in our toolkit. That's the way I look at it. It's a tool...","Paul Cheng","And technically, that you have proved you can do that?","Neil Chapman","We've just not proved that we can do it. What's really important here is if you look at the amount of resource that's extracted out of the unconventional space - and again, it's very different from play-to-play. But it's a relatively small percentage of the resource is actually recovered. I mean, you'll see the industry talk about it. And I won't tell you what our numbers are. But 8% to 10% of the resource is recovered in an unconventional play. If we can extract more than 8% to 10%, you can understand the potential value for us in that. And so it's not just about the length of the lateral, it's about how much resource you can recover from that rock. That will arguably drive the economics as much as how much resource and how quickly you get the resource. There are statistics, everyone sees them, they are public data in terms of how quickly and what the production rates are from these wells. And I know some players in the industry \"with great gusto\" that they're getting a lot of early production and a lot of volume out of the wells initially good. Yes, good, I want to get the maximum volume out of these wells over the life of the wells. And so I am less interested in the early production rates. I know people in the industry are - do seem to be interested in that. I am not. I'm interested in the maximum recoverable resource in the maximum or in the most capital-efficient way.","Paul Cheng","Sure, that's the way to manage it. Neil, can I just sneak in a really quick one. In Guyana that you're talking about 4 billion barrels, is that 4 billion barrel of oil or 4 billion barrel of oil and gas? And if it is the latter, what's the percent of oil?","Neil Chapman","It's a 4 billion barrel of recoverable resource of oil equivalent. I mean, again I'm not going to give you a number in terms of oil and gas here. Well, to make sure I'm sure, you're talking about Guyana here?","Paul Cheng","That's correct.","Neil Chapman","Sorry, I missed the first part. Yes. And so it's primarily oil. Currently, what we're doing with the gas is it will be the - at least the plan currently is for the most part to reinject it to help recovery. We are in discussions with the state around putting some of that gas onshore for power generation, early stages on that. But what we're talking about is recoverable resource. I won't give you a number, Paul. But I will tell you it is primarily oil. It has relatively a low gas content.","Operator","Our last question will come from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.","Theepan Jothilingam","I've just got two. Firstly, as you think about delivering these mega projects, could you talk about how you mitigate for the risk of cost inflation, particularly an up-cycle for the commodity? Are you thinking about procurement in a different way for this cycle? And the second question was just outside Guyana, could you perhaps outline the areas of interest in the second half in terms of Exxon's exploration program?","Neil Chapman","Yes. And Neil Chapman here. I would say in terms of exploration program - and of course, we're a global player. I mean, I would highlight Cyprus. We've been quite clear on Cyprus that we anticipate drilling two wells in Cyprus in the fourth quarter of this year. And that is on plan. Of course, we've made a significant investment in Brazil. We won't be - it will be more in terms of acquiring seismic on those blocks in this year if you're looking for this year. And we'll be drilling some exploration wells on these prospective blocks coming in 2019. What was the other part of the question? I forgot.","Theepan Jothilingam","Yes, I was just wondering about cost inflation, what you're seeing. I mean, you've clearly got some great projects and you're improving things, I think, on the capital efficiency side. But is there a risk you might actually face cost inflation in a higher oil price environment?","Neil Chapman","Well, there's always a risk. I mean, I think there's always a risk. But obviously, our objective is to be the most efficient, you'd understand that. Let me just talk about the Permian for a second because the Permian is really important. And I've heard a lot of discussion around cost inflation there. And of course, the potential exists for high intense activity in a local area to end up with cost inflation. It's one of the areas which I really believe we have an advantage. Because we have such a large position in the Permian, it is allowing us to establish long-term contracts. And I think what's important on these long-term contracts, it's not just about drilling rigs, it's not just about fracking crews. It's about what you do with sand, how you can get sand in. It's about what you do with power and how you get power in. It's about what you do with the recovered water. It's about logistics and evacuation. So we look at all of that.","We believe that having the scale that we have is allowing us to mitigate more than anybody else cost inflation in the basin. I've heard discussion around cost inflation in the Permian Basin in recent months. We have not seen a lot of it. And the reason we haven't seen a lot of it is because we're leveraging our long-term position with the partnerships that we have established. I think going forward, obviously it's absolutely on our minds in terms of how would we mitigate that potential inflation if it really goes on. And that could be in terms of how we purchase power or do we produce power? It can be in do we mine our own sand? It can be in lots of different areas. I would also tell you that if I go back to Guyana, and of course, that's a high intense activity for us right now, we're being very careful in the design of these ships.","The resource space is quite similar across all these exploration blocks. And what that allows us to do is, using an old ExxonMobil term, of design one and build many. And so what I think you have to do in this environment is you have to look for ways to structurally offset the potential of inflation. Do not wait until it hits you. And that's been our message to our organization. We want to see where we have a structural advantage. It's built into the appropriation. And each of the assets that we are building, we ask our project organization and the business all the time, demonstrate to us how you're going to offset the potential of inflationary pressure. Thanks for the question.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, Theepan. To conclude, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in ExxonMobil.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations & Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call.","My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2.","Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date earnings to $11.3 billion. Earnings rose 50% from the prior-year period, as commodity prices improved and business performance strengthened. All three business segments delivered solid results, generating cash flow from operations and asset sales that exceeded dividends and net investments for the fourth consecutive quarter.","These results were achieved as the company worked to safely bring our Gulf Coast manufacturing operations back online following the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. In addition, we continued capturing attractive opportunities across the value chain from securing high-potential exploration acreage, to logistics investments, to expanding chemical capacity in growing markets. I'll highlight these items in more detail later.","Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Overall, global economic growth was modest in the quarter. The Eurozone and Japan experienced slower economic expansion along with the U.S., which was negatively impacted by hurricanes. In China, economic expansion remained steady compared to the previous quarter. The commodity price environment was mixed, as crude oil prices increased, but natural gas prices were flat to down. Global rig count increased slightly, driven by higher activity in North America. Refining margins improved with stronger global distillate demand while global chemical commodity margins softened, driven by increases in feed and energy costs.","Turning now to the financial results on slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $0.93 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $6 billion, reflecting increased activity and the completion of the Jurong Aromatics plant acquisition. As previously indicated, this facility provides added value to integration with our existing world-class petrochemical facilities in Singapore, which are well placed to meet growing regional demand. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.4 billion, more than $1 billion higher than the last quarter. Cash totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and debt was $40.6 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior quarter.","Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, our cash balances increased from $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $8.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Note, this includes a working capital build of approximately $1 billion related to Hurricane Harvey.","Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $3.4 billion. Debt reduction and other financing items decreased cash by $1.4 billion. In the third quarter, ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segment results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings increased $1.3 billion from a year-ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream and Downstream results and lower corporate charges from favorable tax items. Although corporate and financing charges have been trending below our guidance range in recent quarters, we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be toward the high end of the $400 million to $600 million guidance. I'll note that our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, up from 20% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time tax items.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 8. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $1.6 billion, an increase of nearly $950 million from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher realizations. Crude prices rose nearly $6.50 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, while the gas realizations increased about $0.60 per thousand cubic feet.","Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings $70 million, driven by lower operating expenses, which were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $4.53 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving to slide 9, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, an increase of nearly 2% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Liquids production was up 69,000 barrels per day. Favorable volume impacts from projects, work programs and reduced downtime were partly offset by field decline and lower entitlements. Natural gas production decreased 16 million cubic feet per day, as project and work program volumes were more than offset by fuel decline, lower demand and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands.","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results on slide 10. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $300 million compared to the third quarter of 2016. Stronger refining margins, primarily distillate and gasoline, increased earnings by $1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million, mainly due to lower throughput from Hurricane Harvey, partly offset by improved operations. All other items reduced earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million related to the sale of Canadian retail assets in the third quarter of 2016, as well as expenses related to the hurricane.","Now, moving to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 11. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, down $79 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker commodity margins, driven by increased feed and energy costs, decreased earnings by $200 million. Higher product sales, driven by increased demand, new capacity and improved operations, increased earnings by $120 million. All other items in the quarter included costs associated with Hurricane Harvey and expenses from new production units in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, offset in part by favorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving now to slide 12 for an update on our hurricane recovery efforts, Hurricane Harvey had devastating impacts for many of our employees, contractors, and the communities in which we live and operate. Nonetheless, our highly dedicated people and effective operations integrity systems permitted a safe shutdown of our refining and chemical operations in Baytown, Mont Belvieu, and Beaumont.","Because of advanced planning and preparation, we were able to protect the infrastructure of our manufacturing plants, and we're well positioned to resume operations in a timely fashion. Refining and chemical operations at these sites are now back to normal.","Following the storm, we worked closely with our partners and customers who sell our branded products to maximize fuel supplies to consumers and emergency responders. We acted quickly to bring in gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from other regions in the U.S. and abroad to supplement our production, ensuring the return of reliable supply to our customers.","Our Upstream operations fortunately experienced limited impacts, with some offshore platforms temporarily shut in. Overall, Hurricane Harvey had an estimated unfavorable impact on third quarter earnings of $160 million and a debit of $0.04 per share.","ExxonMobil employees continue to dedicate their time and resources to support the communities impacted by the storm, and we are proud of our employees who provided hands-on assistance with flood relief, and we continue to support them in their efforts.","Moving to slide 13, we're making good progress on further strengthening our portfolio in South America with high-potential opportunities. First, in Guyana, we announced our fifth offshore discovery with the successful Turbot well. The well encountered 75 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, and is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the Liza Phase 1 project. Evaluation of the discovery is underway. Importantly, this success proves a new play and helps to derisk multiple plays in the Turbot area. We plan to drill an additional well in the new year to help delineate this discovery. The rig is now moving to the Ranger prospect, which is another new play test on the Stabroek Block.","In Brazil, we are pleased to have secured an attractive offshore acreage position, winning 10 blocks in the September bid round and completing a farm-in on two additional blocks. Each of these blocks is under a concession contract.","In the highly prospective outer Campos pre-salt, ExxonMobil was jointly awarded six blocks with Petrobras. Each partner holds 50% working interest, with Petrobras as the operator. ExxonMobil was also awarded an additional two blocks in the Northern Campos Basin with 100% working interest.","In the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, ExxonMobil recently farmed in with Murphy on two blocks held by QGEP. We then jointly bid with this co-venture group, and we were awarded two additional blocks in the same basin. For all four of these blocks, ExxonMobil will operate and hold a 50% working interest.","The 12 blocks combined offer promising deepwater exploration potential. The Campos Basin blocks are an extension of the pre-salt play where multiple world-class discoveries have been made. We have identified multibillion-barrel prospects on our own existing high-quality seismic data over these blocks and look forward to working with the government and our partners to progress exploration plans. We anticipate commencing exploration activities in 2018 with 3D seismic acquisition and then drilling in 2019.","Turning now to slide 14 for an update on our efforts to further enhance business integration for our growing attractive resources in the Permian Basin to our Gulf Coast manufacturing hubs. As you know, we continue to expand our acreage position in the Permian using strategic trades and acquisitions. Since the Delaware acquisition in the first quarter of this year, ExxonMobil has executed another five acreage transactions, adding a combined total of 22,000 operated acres for an implied cost of about $20,000 per acre. This acreage is contiguous to our core positions, making it ideal for capital-efficient development using long lateral wells, and adds more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels of low-cost resources.","We're also expanding logistics access and flexibility to capture value from wellhead to premium fuels and chemical products. Earlier this year, we completed the formation of the Permian Express Partners pipeline joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners. In addition, in July, we concluded an agreement with Summit Midstream Partners to create a new natural gas gathering and processing system, servicing production from our acreage.","Earlier this month, we further enhanced our logistics capabilities with the acquisition of a crude oil terminal in Wink, Texas from Genesis Energy. This acquisition marks ExxonMobil's first terminal in the Permian Basin to be anchored by the company's recently acquired Delaware acreage.","The terminal is strategically positioned to handle Permian crude oil and condensate for transport to Gulf Coast refineries and marine export terminals. The facility is interconnected to the Plains Alpha Crude Connector pipeline system and is permitted for 100,000 barrels per day of throughput, with the ability to expand. The terminal provides crude producers with a full range of logistical options, including truck, rail, and inbound and outbound pipeline access, establishing ExxonMobil as a key midstream provider in the rapidly growing Permian Basin.","These logistics investments support ongoing manufacturing investments to increase feed processing flexibility and capacity for higher-value products in our Downstream and Chemical businesses. Our leading presence in the Permian, from equity production through to Gulf Coast refining and chemical capacity, positions us for world-class development across the value chain.","Moving to slide 15, the graph on the right shows our progress to date compared to the unconventional liquids volumes forecast we provided at our Analyst Day in March. Our total unconventional production from the Delaware, Midland, and Bakken basins is now over 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.","We are currently operating 20 rigs in the Permian and will continue to ramp up to approximately 30 operated rigs by year-end 2018. We are leveraging our contiguous acreage position to drill long-lateral wells, targeting industry-leading unit development costs. The wells drilled in the Midland this year average about 10,000 lateral feet, well above the industry average.","We continue to work with our dedicated innovation and technology team to improve our efficiency. We told you last quarter about drilling our first 12,500-foot lateral well in the Delaware, and this well was just brought on production.","By leveraging our learnings in the Bakken, where we recently fractured the first of several 3-mile laterals, we will start drilling our first 3-mile lateral in the Permian before year end. ExxonMobil's best-in-class operational expertise allows for more efficient drilling and completions, which in turn enables us to enhance value through our operated investments.","We'll continue to incorporate learnings to lower unit costs as we grow our unconventional liquids at a 20% compounded annual growth rate through 2025, underpinned by near-term annual growth in the Permian at about 45%.","Turning now to slide 16, the summary of the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash highlights the solid performance of our business segments, which enables the company to meet its commitments to our shareholders. As shown, year-to-date 2017 cash flow from operations and asset sales of $24.4 billion funded shareholder distributions, net investments in the business, and a reduction in debt.","In addition, we continue to generate free cash flow while selectively investing in the business and maintaining capital discipline. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter where free cash flow has exceeded distributions to our shareholders since the significant drop in oil prices.","Moving now to the final slide, I'll conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. Simply put, we continue to remain focused on long-term value growth. Our integrated business has grown cash flow from operations and asset sales to over $20 billion, an increase of over 40% compared to the first nine months of 2016.","Our business segments have collectively earned over $11 billion, an increase of over $5 billion compared to the first nine months last year. Upstream production volumes are within our guidance range at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day.","We continue investing in and capturing new high-quality opportunities across the value chain, but remain disciplined in capital allocation while delivering best-in-class execution. This has resulted in total capital expenditures year-to-date of $14.1 billion.","Finally, our year-to-date free cash flow of $13.5 billion more than covered our reliable and growing shareholder distributions of $9.7 billion. In short, we remain confident that our integrated business is well positioned to continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we will first go to Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, Jeff, the capital expenditure year-to-date continues to look quite right relative to your guidance. So I wonder if you could just speak to if whether you really expect a catch-up at the back-end of the year and also maybe the $25 billion indication you gave for 2018. I guess what's at the back of my mind is that the Permian is a very low-cost offset to whatever you think the portfolio decline is. And it seems to us your CapEx flexibility is a lot better than perhaps your guidance suggests?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Doug, as you said, our year-to-date expenditures on CapEx is trending lower at this point, but we still have our guidance at $22 billion. You may recall that our objective is to go ahead and close the transaction for the Mozambique Area 4 acreage before year end, and that's still the plan, and that was about $2.8 billion. At the same time, we have also ramped up some activity in our unconventional business. And, of course, we've got the Brazil transactions that we just consummated. And all of that really leads us to the view that the guidance is appropriate.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To be honest, I didn't \u2013 go on, go on, I'm sorry.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Looking forward into 2018 and thereafter, of course, we'll go ahead and provide an update before 2018 gets there. But our plan is still \u2013 and I wouldn't assume that our CapEx is linear over that timeframe. And I think we showed $70 billion to $80 billion over 2018 to 2020. But it is going to be in the general ballpark of about $25 billion plus or minus. But like I said, we'll go ahead and provide an update here early next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I didn't mean to interrupt you, Jeff. But just to be clear, first of all, I didn't realize that Mozambique had not yet closed, so that explains it perhaps. But the $25 billion number next year also include acquisitions?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, Doug, we tend to leave a little flexibility in the budget to pursue opportunities that come up. But we'll give you \u2013 if there's something that we believe is fairly close and certain, we typically would include it. But if it's not at a point where we believe it's going to close, we typically do not.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. My follow-up is \u2013 I'm not going to be too predictable here, but is Guyana, your comments on Turbot. I guess my understanding is the rig stayed on location several weeks after you disclosed the result. One wouldn't expect you to do that on a small discovery. So I wondered if you could speak to what you're thinking in terms scale of the greater Turbot area. And maybe an update on how you're thinking about the coincident timing of multiple phases in Liza, Payara? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, sure. Well, again, as you would expect that we are very pleased with the Turbot discovery. We do plan \u2013 as I may have indicated previously, we do a plan going back and drill a follow-up well in 2018. The important message on Turbot is that it did confirm a new play, different depositional environment, and there's still a lot of work to be done. It's early days in order to assess it, but there were a number of follow-up plays in this area that allows us to go ahead and better define and potentially go ahead and assess.","As you go forward, to your second question about the subsequent developments, what I would tell you is that obviously, we're very encouraged by the results in Guyana. We had previously given you a range of about 2.3 million to 2.8 million barrels of recoverable resource. Obviously, the Turbot results puts us towards the higher end of that. And we will certainly, as we better define Turbot, we will certainly refine our resource range. But given those results, we have had active development planning for subsequent phases and progress. I would say given the significant exploration success to date that we are considering at least two more phases, Phase 2 and Phase 3, for Guyana. And we are also considering higher processing capacity for the ships. Now, of course, as we continue our parallel exploration program, that will be integrated into our development planning efforts, and things may change. But very positive progress and certainly a very important component of our portfolio going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, Jeff, I'll leave it there. But I just wondered if you would give us some idea as to when you would expect to FID the subsequent phases. And I'll really leave it there. Sorry for the extended question.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I really don't have \u2013 I certainly appreciate the interest, Doug, and I really don't have a timeline at this point. We're looking at all the various options, but given the progress we made, I mean, you can appreciate with the Phase 1 development, that was a best-in-class five year from discovery to startup, and the extent that we can continue to capture the, if you will, Design One Build Many concept, we want to keep on a fairly good pace going forward. Okay?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And we'll now go to Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Around this time of the year, companies often reassess strategy and pay incentives to reflect changes in competitive and corporate governance environments. And on this point, ExxonMobil has historically emphasized returns on capital employed and free cash flow and shareholder distributions, and these metrics have very strong correlations to total shareholder return, which is obviously a good thing, especially in relation to some of the growth metrics.","Simultaneously, ExxonMobil's stock is flat versus a decade ago and relative performance versus energy peers is mixed. And so that begs the question whether a change in the mix or weightings of incentives is needed or whether a more challenging peer group, which might include S&P 500, as a peer has done, might be beneficial to shareholders, too. So can you comment, Jeff, on how the company thinks about these issues given the performance of the stock over the past decade? And how important this topic is internally in the grand scheme of things?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Doug, as we've talked in the past, I'll just reinforce to the broader group that it is very important. And the fundamental principle for our executive compensation structure is to tie a large component of the compensation to the same performance that our shareholders will experience.","So we have one of, if not the longest, incentive programs in terms of vesting. And the -again, the \u2013 that whole ultimate compensation is driven by how the stock will ultimately do. As you know, we are in a business that has very long cycle times on returns because of the magnitude of the investment. And we want to make sure that we hold our executives to the decisions that they made over a long period of time. So we have a very large part of the compensation that is performance-based, that is tied directly to the share's performance. As you said, there are other parameters that the board considers, and return on capital employed and safety performance are two of the seven key criteria.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. No, you definitely seem to be using the right metric, so I just wonder if the weightings could be reset or what have you. But anyway, so \u2013 I also have one other question, Jeff. You guys announced a pretty meaningful asset sale, if I read this correctly. Can you talk about how it affected the published earnings number of $0.93 per share in the quarter?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","The \u2013 you mean the overall asset proceeds of...","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Yes. Was there any gains and losses we should know about that were meaningful?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. So, overall, from an earnings impact, it was actually a quarter-on-quarter decrease.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","A quarter-to-quarter decrease on earnings by about 300 \u2013 just over $300 million.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","On the overall proceeds, in the release, it was about $850 million. And a lot of that in the third quarter was really associated with the receivable that we had due in Papua New Guinea.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, absolutely.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay?","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, Jeff. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","All right. Thank you, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe another strategic question to start. Peak oil demand driven by (32:59) penetration has increasingly captivated investor attention, and it does represent a medium to longer-term challenge. I know that you expect on your macro work to see demand growth for decades yet. Has the risk of peak oil demand altered in any way, or how is that considered in your gating process for both Upstream and Downstream projects, especially given the depth in your portfolio?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Evan, this is a very important question and one that probably can take a lot of time to describe. But for us, it really starts with the annual update of our energy outlook. That is fundamental to providing us the insights around our business strategy and our investment planning. If I very quickly summarize that oil demand is primarily driven by three components: light-duty vehicle consumption, heavy-duty consumption and petrochemicals. And what's really driving that growth are the latter two: petrochemicals and heavy-duty consumption.","Right now, there's not a sufficient alternative to replace those energy sources because of the energy intensity requirements. Now our energy outlook assumes on light-duty vehicles that we will reach a peak in gasoline demand and come down, and that's driven by two things. It's driven by efficiency of ICE, of internal combustion engines, as well as greater hybrid and EV penetration into the marketplace. So the bottom result of all this is, is that we do look at variations in the peak or in the EV penetration. And if you look at our forecast right now, we have by 2040 the fleet is about 6% EV. If you were to increase that by 50%, that would have a liquids demand impact of about 0.5 million barrels per day.","So not substantial when you think about overall oil demand of over 100 million barrels per day at that point, but certainly, something that we keep a very close look at as we think about our research and development activities, as well as building the strategy. And then a key element of what we have been doing in this area is, and you've heard us talk about it, is how we are making strategic investments today in order to upgrade those gasoline molecules into higher-value products, like distillates and lubricants.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate the color. Second one on the U.S. onshore bases. Exxon is one of the fastest accelerators here, growth you've gone from 16 to 25 rigs and four in the Permian just since mid-year, and your plan is here to add another 10 by 2018. I guess, particularly as it relates to the Permian, are you seeing any deterioration in equipment or completion crew quality that is being highlighted by some smaller operators? And are you able to fully mitigate or offset some of those pressures given your global sourcing advantage?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. No, that's a good question because any time you come off a very low cycle like we've just been through, you have to be very mindful of the crew qualifications and the equipment capability. But remember, Evan, that even in that low cycle, we maintained a fairly active rig program in the onshore U.S., and that is because we want to maintain that learning curve benefit and we want to make sure that we are taking full advantage of the market at that point.","So therefore, as we ramp up, we've got a very strong fleet of service providers. As we add additional rigs, clearly, the partnership that we've got with our service providers, they understand what the minimum standards are because what you want to avoid is all that rework associated with execution, shortfalls in quality \u2013 shortfalls in quality performance.","But we have not \u2013 there is nothing material that I would point to at this stage, but it's something that you've got to watch very carefully as you go into a ramp-up phase, especially in areas where there's a lot of activity.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning, Jeff. Just first question, I just want to clarify the comment on the asset sale gains in earnings. You mentioned that quarter-over-quarter, but could you give us the absolute number? I know Downstream \u2013 we didn't have the gains from last quarter, but what was the absolute Upstream gain?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","And you're asking for in the quarter or quarter-on-quarter?","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the quarter on an absolute basis.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","The absolute gain was almost $80 million in the quarter, and most of that was in the Upstream.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you. Second question is on the CapEx that was asked about before looking towards the longer term. You were talking about $25 billion plus or minus in a given year. And I think when I asked about this last quarter, you did seem to suggest maybe it'd be a bit more of a linear path lower and then kind of ramping in the out years. Is that still how you think about it, or will 2018 be more in that $25 billion plus or minus?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. Phil, I think it's probably best to wait until we get to the next phase of communication around our forward investment plans. I mean, it's going to be in the \u2013 where we are in 2017 to around that ballpark. But as you know, we picked up a number of very attractive new assets that we're going to get after right away. And that needs to be integrated into our forward investment plans.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then you made a comment that you will not be doing buybacks to offset dilution. I think in the third quarter \u2013 I mean, it tends to be lumpy it appears, maybe if you can just comment on that and the decision not to do that.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. So there's two components. One is the purchase of shares to offset dilution for our benefits plans and programs, and that is lumpy. That happens usually I believe in the first quarter timeframe. The second component of that is our buyback program. And as we've talked previously in capital allocation, the way we think about it from our sources of funds, the first things that are being funded are our dividends and our investment program. And if there's any cash left at that point given that the corporation does not want to hold large cash reserves, it's at that point that we will look for what the next best thing is.","And maybe if we have some debt maturing, we'll pay that debt down. But on a quarterly basis, we'll make a decision on whether we go ahead and buy back some shares. And I'll say, Phil, that decision is a function of number of factors. One being the current financial position of the corporation, as I said, both our CapEx and dividend requirements, as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook, but it's a decision that ultimately is made on a quarterly basis.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If we could come back to the Permian, the comment about 10,000-foot average laterals now going to 12,500 or at 12,500 and then the idea of 15,000, can you give us an idea of maybe what you've done pilot-wise to this point that gives you confidence that's the right direction to go just because as you go longer laterals, more things can go wrong, and since you do have the acreage, maybe an idea of the performance you're seeing out of those longer wells relative to, say, 10,000 or less?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","It's a good question, and you're really honing in on a key element of our overall strategy. I'll start with it's probably becoming much clearer to the group what the value chain strategy that we've put in place for the Permian. We've built up a very large contiguous acreage position that really allows us to leverage the strength of our technology capability. For us, I'll be real clear. It's not about just how we execute. It's all about how do we extend best-in-class performance. Clearly, what we're trying to do is leverage our full technological capability to go ahead and achieve the lowest unit cost and then capturing the highest value from the barrels through the full value chain, ultimately to the customer. Okay?","So what have we done is we have recently drilled several wells in the Bakken on 3-mile laterals. The first one has been completed now. These are very long wells. We want to make sure that we get good inflow performance across the full lateral length. We drilled the first well in Delaware at 12,500 feet, and that well is just coming on right now. And we're getting ready to drill a 3-mile lateral in the Permian as well. And we've got a very focused research effort on this from the reservoir all the way to the hardware, and we're really looking at how do we make a step change in the ultimate development here.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, back to the earlier question on CapEx, if we make the adjustment for the \u2013 let's just assume the Permian acreage was the big change Q2 to Q3, it implies that your overall CapEx was fairly stable Q2 to Q3. And then you have the Mozambique in front of you. Is there any other \u2013 other than the comments about higher drilling in the Lower 48, anything else that we should think about that steps up as we go into year end the first part of 2018?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Let me just correct you. On the increase in the third quarter, that was primarily driven by closing the acquisition for Jurong Aromatics. Okay?","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm sorry. I was talking Upstream CapEx only.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Oh. Okay.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So $2.8 billion went to roughly $3.2 billion, and the math works out that that's the Permian. Obviously, you've got plenty of things moving around, but I was just trying to understand. If that is the case, then the step-up, even if we adjust for Mozambique, still has to be fairly significant in the latter part of this year. And then I was just wondering what else was going on as we walk our way into 2018 other than an increase in Lower 48 activity?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Probably the biggest piece is the increase in the Lower 48 drilling, predominantly in the unconventional. I'll just remind you, we also have four major projects underway that a couple of them are getting close to a startup stage, so it's primarily project spending, it's the ramp-up on unconventional, and then our base work program in the Upstream.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","I'd like to get your assessment of the LNG market right now, considering it ties back to a couple of the acquisitions you made over the past year-plus. And you did mention that some of the capital ramp is going into those new assets.","The market has been really quiet over the course of all of 2017, not a lot of new FID activity or reports of buyers really looking to accelerate commitments. And I wonder how much of that is due to the wall of supply that's coming on between now and 2018? And if you think that can pick up as the second half of next year emerges, or if this quiet period might last a little bit longer and how that might affect some of your timing around those new big global gas assets you have?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Sam, again, I'd start with our energy outlook, where we've got gas growing from 2015 to 2040 at about 1.5% per year. And a pretty sizable component is our LNG business, and that's growing probably about 2.5 times over that timeframe.","Now, just like any type of commodity, we're going to have periods of oversupply and periods where there will be insufficient supply. And I think everybody's well aware there's a number of projects that have come on that are ramping up. Others will be starting up, and that's likely to provide a period where we'll have oversupply to, say, the mid-2020s. But as we think about the very large, very diverse portfolio we have that potentially could be LNG projects, we're moving all of them forward at the pace consistent with where the project is in its maturation timeline.","And the objective is to move all of them into a final investment decision. But we recognize they're not all going to go at that same pace. The key here, the very important message here is, we've got to be on the far left side of the cost of supply curve. We have got to be the most cost competitive out there in the market in order to attract that demand growth that I was talking about.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess \u2013 so the follow-up then, I guess, because this hasn't been apparent, by the way. The market has progressed over the past year or so. Do you think that there will be opportunities for you to get commitments from buyers at the scale that you might need to FID some of these project, even if the market at that time is oversupplied? Are you seeing from your customers a look out into that post-2022 timeframe when the market is more balanced and they can sign up commitments out in the future, or do they need to see more near-term evidence of tightness before they move?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I think it's a mix of both. I think the buyers are looking far out. Obviously, they need that supply. They need to make sure that they are well positioned from their standpoint to competitively capture that supply. I would just remind everybody that we have underpinned our past LNG project funding decisions with long-term firm contracts. And we all know that the market continues to evolve, adding more flexibility in commercial terms on shorter durations.","So while our objective remains to secure commercial certainty to underpin these large funding decisions, it's more likely that projects in the near future were based on a hybrid of sales, although that doesn't diminish our interest in locking in long-term firm contracts.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right, thank you so much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And we'll now go to Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Jeff. There's a little bit more Permian disclosure that's being referenced. When I look at the data that you've given here, you added 22,000 operated acres, more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels. So would I be mistaken in assuming that you spent about $400 million in the quarter based on the statement that you paid about $1 an oil equivalent barrel? And would I be even more mistaken if I said that that was about $18,000 an acre, or is that pretty much inferenced?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","That's an implied cost. And the reason I say that, Paul, is because the five transactions we're talking about were both cash and trades. So there were a number of non-cash trades that were in there as well.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, all right. That's fine. And then it's interesting that you're talking about these much longer laterals, the 10,000 feet. And then you're saying that you're going to be drilling a 3-mile lateral in the Permian, but you've actually just completed one in the Bakken. I think that's what I heard, correct?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","That's right. We actually drilled \u2013 I think it's four in the Bakken, and we've completed the first one.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thank you. And then if I look at the slide, and this is obviously slide 15, the implication of the very impressive growth forecast that you have is that you have all the acreage you need more or less to achieve the very aggressive volume growth that you're going for insofar as you identify the acreage that's going to provide that. Again, is that too much inference, or is that a fair sort of...","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, Paul, that's a good clarification. The volume that we have on slide 15 is really based on existing acreage that we have. Now, as I said in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're doing in a lot of our transactions is a build on \u2013 they bolt on to existing acreage that we have. So directionally, I can share that one of the strategies is to continue to grow that contiguous acreage.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then Jurong was reported in the press to be a $1.7 billion sale. I think that's public information. Is that about the number? I'm trying to get obviously to the clean underlying CapEx.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Paul, unfortunately, we're bound by a confidentiality agreement on that with the sellers.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood, Jeff. And then the last one for me was that you did mention that you've been trending lower in corporate and other expenses, but there will be a bounce in Q4. I just wondered what that was about. It's bit of an arcane question for you, but thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","As you know, corporate finance costs have a lot of variables in them. But I would say that probably the largest part of it, Paul, will be the absence of some of the favorable items that we're seeing in this quarter.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Fair enough, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Jeff, maybe just a couple quick ones. In the Permian disclosure that you have there, you talk about the planned increase from 20 Permian rigs to 30 by year-end 2018. Is the assumed pace of activity growth the same as what was implied in the 2017 Analyst Day earlier this year?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I would tell you that it's picking up a bit. And I will just \u2013 just make sure I want to clarify for everybody that these are operated rigs. This does not include non-operated rigs that we participated in. But the volumes itself is our total net production. The \u2013 but the rig counts \u2013 I mean, it's comparable to what we had originally planned when we detailed out the basis for the acquisition, and that's what we shared with you in the March Analyst.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And how do you think \u2013 when you look at over that multi-year period, how much does commodity price figure into that? I mean, you tend to kind of \u2013 I know you are executing the long-term plan, which is based on value creation. But as you think about potential upside and downside risk to that plan going forward, how much does the commodity figure in versus if you think of things like efficiency gains and cost inflation or inflation?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Certainly it's a factor, but we're working on both sides of that equation. We're not only working on the realization being mindful of it as we do the economics, but we're also working on the overall capital invested and operating costs driving that cost basis down.","And you may recall in an earlier call, we provided a snapshot \u2013 I think it was in the Analyst Meeting, a snapshot of the economic resiliency of the existing portfolio. And at $40 flat rail, which is a reasonable lower end here, we had over 5,500 wells in the Permian and the Bakken that generated at least a 10% rate of return. And a large part of them \u2013 let's say about a third of them generated actually better than a 30% rate of return. So very good economic resiliency, but don't think of that as being static because we continue to work on dropping that cost. And you remember, last quarter I was sharing with you all that while our average unit development cost is $7 per oil equivalent barrel, we are trying to push that down further to \u2013 as far down as $5 per barrel.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. Thanks. And then maybe just one on Brazil. I appreciate the disclosure you have in the slides on Brazil. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your thoughts on the acreages that you've acquired, and how it would compare possibly to the upcoming pre-salt round, which I think is going on today in blocks, which I think you're potentially involved in? And then maybe what are your requirements from a drilling and seismic point of view over the next few years and how it more broadly fits into your global exploration portfolio?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","As you probably pick up from my prepared comments, we're very excited about the acreage position that we have. In fact, the bid round that's going on right now, I guess it's been announced now that ExxonMobil won the high bid on North Carcara as well. So this has really allowed us to get into a very prolific basin that we've been looking at for some time. You're all very much aware that this is all about value for us, and we've been very mindful of making sure that while it's got a very strong resource endowment, we needed to do it on the terms that it was competitive with our existing inventory, and we're very pleased with that.","So, obviously, when you think about how we high-grade the portfolio, it's all about through our acquisitions and our exploration program, bringing in resources that go to the very top of the portfolio and then through our divestment program, monetizing the resources at the very bottom. And our full intent, as I said in my prepared comments, to get right after the Brazil acreage, we've got some really strong partners that we'll be working with. Well, we've already got some seismic \u2013 as I said in the prepared comments that we have some good sense of what's out there we're going to get right out to in 2018 3D seismic and then shortly thereafter, drilling. So very pleased with where we are. The potential that we've got and yet another high-quality deepwater resource that we'll bring our expertise to.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Good morning, Jeff. It's a topic that you mentioned, the Brazil award that has just been announced. I'm going to guess Exxon shifted a lot of the deepwater focus in recent years from West Africa to South America. Do you think the focus on the other side of the Atlantic margin is geological based or regulatory or really a combination of both?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I mean, we keep a very broad brief of where there is high-value potential in the various basins. And really when you think about how we have structured our exploration program, it's primarily focusing in two areas. One being a focused exploration program on high-quality resources where we have existing operations that we can quickly leverage to get those discoveries on production in a very fast timeframe. And then the second area is new big, high-value potential that's play-opening. In Brazil, very strong geology, the government has evolved the fiscal basis and it's got good fiscal \u2013 competitive fiscal terms. So that's where \u2013 how we are focusing it on \u2013 on the exploration program.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","My follow-up, Jeff, on the offshore is we're seeing a lot of deflation, and some of the recently awarded rig contracts have been getting pretty low. Are we at the stage yet that ExxonMobil is getting concerned about the financial viability of the supply chain that you see? And if so, what are you trying to do about it?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I think you do address an issue that this industry has had to deal with over the cycles. When you get into low period, as I referenced earlier, the service sector starts getting down to their cost structure and we have got to find \u2013 continue to find those win-win solutions that allow the producer to achieve an attractive return, and at the same time keep the service sector healthy.","One of the areas that I think ExxonMobil contributes is, we develop very long effective relationships with our supplier sector. And they fully understand that \u2013 the amount of activity that we can provide is a function of the value they add to the investment decisions.","They have a tremendous amount of capability and innovative concepts that they have brought to collaborate with us in terms of providing new solutions for some of the more challenging resources. And I think we have a mutual objective here, and I think most of the service sectors understand that as well.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay, thank you very much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thanks, Alastair.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Simple really quick clarification. Earlier in your presentation when you were looking at the Permian expected growth, say, up to 500,000 \u2013 600,000-barrel per day production by year 2025, is that based on the rig program at 30 by the end of next year and then steady, or whether that's based on a continuing incremental growth in the rig program?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","It's really the latter. We would see some further growth in the rig program.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And at this point, that is too early for you to comment on what is the growth rate of the rigs that you may have in mind?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, and really it's an interesting question because remember, these rigs are getting much, much more productive and how we drill these wells are getting much \u2013 much more efficient. I mean, I would expect over this timeframe that we will see much greater efficiency as we continue to progress this development as we have historically.","I mean, if you look the rig counts right now in the Lower 48, while they're down more than 50%, that's not an equivalent reduction in overall activity because these rigs are much, much more productive today than they were back at the peak periods.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Second question, that in the press release and you also mentioned the half year impact is $160 million. Just want to clarify, is that represent only the cost associated for the repair or this is also include the lost opportunity costs?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. It includes two components. It includes the expenses as well as the lost volume. So that $160 million as we had in the press release and as I talked about previously equates to about a $0.04 per share hit.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on Turbot, the mix \u2013 where are you going to drill next year, is that a place or to the Turbot discovery itself, or are you just going to test on the good (01:04:12) Turbot area other structures?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","It will \u2013 on the existing resource, it will be a delineation of the existing resource, there's some \u2013 anytime you drill \u2013 remember this is a large area with a very small wellbore that's gone through it. These are generally stratigraphic traps. And it's about making sure that we test these multiple traps that we've seen in these accumulations. So it's going to have several objectives as we go forward. And then, of course, there in the general Turbot area, there are several other prospects that given now we have now proven the play, we need to go ahead and integrate those learnings into our forward rig schedule.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And final one. The 22,000 net acre, the five transaction that you did, you mentioned there's about $20,000, so that's roughly about $440 million. So should we assume that the increase in \u2013 from the second to third quarter in the U. S. CapEx is all related to this because I mean if you back out $440 million, it actually \u2013 well, it means that CapEx in U.S. actually slightly down sequentially?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, actually that's not the case, Paul, because as I responded to Paul Sankey earlier, that is a combination of both cash as well as trades that we made.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see, okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Because there were some non-cash transactions there.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But you still have a net increase of 22,000, right, or that the 22,000 is the final transaction, which is not a net increase?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","That's a net increase of 22,000 in the Permian.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. So it is a net increase even now that you have the trade, you're still \u2013 no, but that's fine. We can get you off-line. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. Don't think that the trade is \u2013 involved is just Permian assets.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understand, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And we'll now move to Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, Jeff. Good morning. It's late in the hour, so I'll just keep it to one question. I wanted to just shift gears a bit to our European gas, last quarter that came off pretty dramatically and it looks like it's remained depressed. I don't know if you could just help us kind of ways to think about modeling that going forward. I know seasonally you would typically have an uptick into 4Q, but any thoughts on that potentially returning at some point to next year or so?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, there really are two components on the European gas. Obviously, as you already pointed out, seasonal demand impacts which would turn around in the fourth quarter or start to turnaround in the fourth quarter. And then the second, it was about \u2013 I'm thinking it was about a 90 million cubic feet a day impact associated with the regulatory cap on the Netherlands, as well I think, Blake, there was some downtime in the UK.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","And just so I'm clear on that 90 million a day, is there any outlook on that potentially changing into the future? Or should we just view that as pretty much out of the volume mix going forward?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, we are in \u2013 or NAM is in active discussion with the government. I really can't speculate on how that will play itself out over time.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And we'll now go to Jason Gammel from Jefferies.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Well, thanks. I just wanted to come back to the point that you're making about enhancing Permian across the integrated value chain. Obviously, you've been building a big Upstream position and already have the Downstream position on the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about appetite for owning midstream assets? And I guess to put them in the context of the terminal acquisition at Wink. What would you consider strategic that you would want to own with obviously your low cost of capital, and what are you willing to contract out?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Jason, thanks for highlighting that because that's really the key message that we wanted to convey as it relates to our Permian. It's just not a pure Permian play, it's the full value chain from resource all the way to molecules to the customers, whether it would be refined products or chemical products.","And as you heard in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're looking and we continue to look at is, where is the value leakage across that value chain, and do we add value in that? And if we do, that's what will play into our strategy and how we capture incremental assets along that value chain.","On the Permian, we've got a very strong Gulf Coast manufacturing facilities. We have a very strong Permian resource position, we pick up these flexibility in a logistic system through the pipeline transactions that we've made. We've now got this oil terminal. It gives us control and value capture. We will continue \u2013 like we do in all of our assets, by the way, we'll continue to look at how can you further strengthen that value chain proposition that we or our shareholders are capturing a majority of the value there.","Now, there may be some things along that value chain that we just don't add value to, and we're okay with someone else providing that missing piece in the value chain and getting value for it. But I think you get a better line of sight of what we're doing in terms of our value chain management.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay, thanks a lot, Jeff. And just the second one, if I could, please. Now that the Jurong transaction has been completed, can you give us some idea of how to think about the incremental profitability from the Chemical business? And I know we've got the PX volume and we can take that times margin, but can you just talk about some of the synergistic benefits that you get from that transaction when you combine it with your existing Singapore assets?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I think probably the best guidance we've got from me for a quantification is what you just said in terms of the additional aromatics that we are picking up from it. And remember, there's still about \u2013 it's about 65,000 barrels a day of fuel coming from that facility as well. But, of course, the value proposition for us was not only the added value we will get from what the market currently values the asset from because of the unique contributions we think we bring to it, but also the synergies between the Jurong Aromatics site and our big Singapore manufacturing facilities. Probably the biggest part of that is logistics, leveraging the logistics capability of that site for the full integrated site, but we have not put numbers out there externally on that.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. I guess I'll just make some guesses then. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets has our next question.","Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two. First one is on Mozambique, could you just talk through the steps from now until closing and any significant things you need to close it by year-end, and if there's any risk to that slipping into 2018?","And the second one is just on the Carcara acquisition that was announced just now. In the press release, from one of your peers, there were some contingent payments. I was wondering if you could just detail whether these are just related to the oil price or anything else that you can highlight. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay. On the first one, on Mozambique, I mean, it's really simple in that we need to get a number of approvals and we are still waiting for those approvals. As to the possibility that it's spilling into 2018, there's always a possibility. But our objective right now, Biraj, is to go ahead and conclude this, this year.","On Carcara, I'm not sure I know what you're really referring to. I'm going to have to punt on this one because I'm not sure what you're referring to.","Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets","Just the press release from Statoil says they'll get $800 million from you guys and then a contingent payment of $500 million. So I was wondering what that $500 million was contingent on.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay. Yeah. Biraj, I don't \u2013 we're bound under the confidentiality agreement. I really can't talk about the commercial terms.","Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. No worries. Thank you very much.","Operator","Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP has our next question.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Good morning, Jeff, just a couple of questions. Firstly, you have been very active in the asset market in Mozambique and Brazil. I was just wondering how you see some of the potential offset by being a bit more active on the disposal side, particularly given some firming of prices there? That's my first question, actually. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Theepan, a key element of our asset management program, as I said earlier, is to go ahead and monetize those assets on the bottom of the portfolio, importantly where others see value that is incremental above what we expect that we can capture from the continuing operation. We are always considering whether we can go ahead and complete that type of a transaction. So if you look at, for instance, the last five years, our total proceeds from asset sales were over $20 billion.","So as I've said before, anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion a year, we've historically went ahead and sold. But it is very focused on making sure that we're getting the most value from each one of our assets. And if we get the right value proposition, we'll go ahead and pursue it. But it is a key element of our ongoing asset management to the various business lines.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Great. And then the second question I had was \u2013 and I come back to the recent asset transactions, and you talk very much about having control in the Permian. I'm interested in terms of the moves both in Brazil and Mozambique to a certain degree where you've got less control. Is that a trend that we can expect more of outside U.S. onshore that you're prepared to take more non-operated positions?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I would say fundamentally, if we can operate, we feel like we've got the greatest value proposition to bring. But that doesn't make that an exclusive criterion. If we think that there is a good value proposition and the co-venture \u2013 the structure of the co-venture is certainly very much willing to go ahead and allow us to contribute to the maximum extent, that's what we're going to try to go ahead and set up. But the key here is the value capture proposition and the operatorship, and the qualifications of those operators and our ability to make sure that we can influence the outcomes is all incorporated in that value proposition.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Okay, all right. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thanks, Theepan.","Operator","And we'll go to Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets.","Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.","Thanks, Jeff. I'll keep this to one question considering the timing. Just on Baytown, you've obviously reiterated you haven't had too much in terms of production impacts because of Harvey. But can you just give us an update on the steam cracker and the development project there in terms of just impacts, delays, and are there any carryover to 2018, and just if there's going to be a slower ramp-up to 2020 impacts?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","So just to recap, the whole project included a new steam cracker at Baytown for 1.5 million tons per annum. And then currently, we've invested in Mont Belvieu for the derivative units two 650,000-ton metallocene polyethylene trains. On the latter part, the first train has started up and the second train is starting up now. So we have started generating a revenue stream for that project.","On the steam cracker, the site was temporarily shut down due to the hurricane, but the construction activities resumed once all of our assessments were completed. And right now, the plan is that we would get to mechanical completion early in the part of next year and then production by the middle of the year.","Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.","Okay, I appreciate the update.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Anish Kapadia from TPH has our next question.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi, Jeff. The first question was on Golden Pass. So I was just wondering how does that fit into your U.S. integration strategy. And has the decision by Qatar to increase its LNG capacity significantly shifted your partners' focus and I suppose your own focus in expanding production in Qatar rather than going ahead with Golden Pass?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Anish, it's a good question. As I said earlier, we've got a number of opportunities in which we can invest in order to capture that LNG demand growth. And we're progressing them all concurrently. Now, Golden Pass obviously is another key aspect of the value chain within North America gas. We're the largest producer of North American gas, so we continue to progress the opportunity there.","As you know, after a fairly extensive period of time, earlier this year, we received the Department of Energy's authorization for export of LNG to non-FTA countries, which was an important milestone that happened in April of this year. Now we're focused on bringing together the remaining elements of the project, that being finalizing the technical definition as well as the commercial details for a final investment decision. But it is one of many opportunities that we're progressing.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay, thank you. And then I had another question. I just wanted to go back to the CapEx once again, and sorry to get back to that. I just wanted to clarify. So the way I understand the CapEx for this year, it seems like on an organic basis, if you strip out the acquisitions, it's approximately $17 billion, I think going up to $25 billion next year on an organic basis. So I just wanted to try and bridge what that gap is. So where does the incremental $8 billion come from? And the acquisition that was announced today from Statoil of approximately $1.4 billion, is that included also in the 2018 spend? Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","A couple points. One is that, remember, when we set up a budget, there's a fair bit of flexibility. And fundamentally, what we're trying to do is live within our means. We're very focused on being selective in our investment program, maintaining our capital discipline. And there may be some things that we'll decide to slow down and replace it with an opportunity that comes in. So it's not necessarily that it's 100% fixed and all of the specific budget allocations are going to be executed with whatever we came up with in our planning process.","I'll give you a good example, and I think I've said it before. Jurong Aromatics specifically was not in our budget for 2017. And we still believe that the budget guidance that we issued almost a year ago is still staying appropriate for sharing with you all. So there are some things that will move in and out. And as a result, there is a level of change-out \u2013 or dynamic change-out going on in that forward projection. If you go back to the 2018 and 2020 forward look, we shared with you in the analyst presentation the key components that were driving those capital expenditures over that timeframe, and that's probably the best guidance I've got for you at this point.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay, thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll now go to Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Jeff, we've talked a lot about the asset deals that you've done here, whether it's InterOil, Bass, the 22,000 acres, Jurong, Mozambique. But can you talk a little bit about the corporate M&A market? Now historically you guys have said that the U.S. E&P sector, for example, was not appropriately valued or you weren't able to identify attractive opportunities at the right price as that sector has underperformed or other corporate deals that are out there. Has that bid\/ask started to close from your perspective?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I'd tell you, Neil, I would respond this way; that we're not limiting any of our potential opportunity base. So we'll keep open to where there may be attractive opportunities for us to pursue. Remember, there are two things you're trying to achieve here. One is, you're trying to \u2013 in anything you pick up, whether it'd be an asset acquisition or a corporate acquisition, you either want to get material synergy benefits or being able to add value above what the market values that asset at or both, ideally both.","So we keep a very full look, we keep the aperture very wide on where there may be opportunities. But as you've seen here in the recent past, primarily where we see the greatest value is on asset acquisitions. Now, some of those assets were held by a single company, and that's what they had, so it ended up being one and the same. But right now, what's most attractive to us has been these asset acquisitions.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's great. And then the follow-up, Jeff, is just on your Canadian oil sands business. The ramp at Kearl has been taken a little bit longer than anticipated a few years ago, where do you stand there, and just the latest in terms of the potential sanctioning of that, recognizing that Imperial is also on a position to comment on this?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Clearly, I'll just say upfront, I mean, the Imperial organization has really worked Kearl very hard and making some really great progress. I give them a lot of credit for the progress that they're making. This is a long-lived asset, and we see the long-term value in it. It has not ramped up as we would have expected. But we have made, as I said, very good progress in reducing the cost structure and very focused on improving the reliability. And we're bringing the full capability of the organization to bear on this. And remember, this is just not the asset, we are thinking about the full value chain benefits as well. But I have the utmost confidence that the organization is going to continue to grow value on Kearl.","And \u2013 but I think job number one right now is to get that reliability up. So we've got some work to be done there. And we are not shy about it, but we are very optimistic about where we are heading. Around future investments in the oil sands, I think I'd characterize it this way that \u2013 and, Neil, you've heard me say this before in that we are really building this business to be durable in a low-price environment. That means we've got to get the technology to the point that it is going to get the cost of supply down that regardless of where we are in the price cycle, that we're generating a very attractive return.","And I will tell you, we've made great progress in terms of in situ technology and capability. And we're very encouraged by that progress, particularly in SA-SAGD. And \u2013 but I would say that we still got a little bit further to go. Not only are we at a point where we are able to substantially increase the overall return, but also reduce the cost, as well as reduce the environmental footprint. And that's important for us as we go forward. But we've got a very large acreage position, it's important that we get this thing right, and the organization is very focused on it.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","We'll go to Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. When your guiding to CapEx for 2018, and you talk about the $25 billion number, what's the breakdown of that between organic and acquisitions? In other words, are you baking in credit for cash outlays on acquisition activity for next year?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Pavel. As we talked earlier, I mean, probably the best guidance I can give you right now would be going back and look at how we've segmented our investment plans between 2018 to 2020 in the Analyst Meeting. As I said earlier, if there is a transaction that we believe is very close to reaching agreement, we will typically go ahead and include it in our forward-looking investment plans, like Mozambique was for this year.","But other than that, we keep some flexibility in our budget. And remember what we're trying to do here is, it's all about the value proposition. We're going to live within our means, we're going to manage our CapEx appropriately. We're going to keep our financial flexibility, but we are not going to forego opportunities. We've got significant financial capability to go ahead and pursue opportunities when they come up. And I think that is a unique attribute of this corporation, is that when, particularly in a down cycle, we can go ahead and respond fairly quickly when those opportunities come up. And let me say, a lot of them come up and they come up very quickly. You have got to be able to respond, and we've got the financial capability and the expertise to go ahead and accrete value on a lot of these things.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thanks, Pavel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob West from Redburn.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Hi, thanks for having me on the call. In Brazil, you talked about competitive fiscal terms. And what I wanted to ask you is, are those fiscal terms competitive with something like the Permian? And really what's behind the question is, as you look at new resource opportunities now around the world, be it Mozambique or Brazil or other ones, how much do the fiscal terms have to compete with the fiscal terms in the Permian to make you want to invest?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. Rob, think about it a couple of ways. One is, is that I think most resource owners understand that they are competing globally for investment dollars. And the key aspect of that is not only the quality of the resource endowment, but also how competitive the fiscal terms are. Are they globally competitive, are they transparent and are they stable and predictable, I mean, fundamentally? That's what's going to set for a very attractive investment climate. And where you have seen significant investment is generally tied to how those fiscal terms have supported an international investment program.","Now, for us, Rob, it is not a kind of either or that we've got to do the Permian or we've got to do something else. As I said a moment ago, we've got sufficient financial flexibility. For us, it is the full package, the resource quality, the fiscal terms and our ability to go ahead and get to market from a value chain perspective and capture value. So it's always that value proposition.","So we are making the trade-offs on the full value proposition to make sure that we are meeting our fundamental mission here, and that is growing shareholder value with accretive investments. Now, our portfolio is very geographically diverse, and there are some political aspects that we've got to tie into these investment decisions. And I think that's an attribute of the corporation that once again is very unique.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. So just the first part of that question was on whether the fiscal terms in Brazil are competitive with fiscal terms in Permian. I'm not sure if you missed that one or you can't comment on it. I just wanted to go back.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","No, I really don't have anything to share on comparing and contrasting specific asset fiscal terms.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Let me ask another one then. And one point you've made before that I think has been well made is that your scale gives you better long term-ism when it comes to procurement, and I was wondering. In 3Q 2017, was that the case in the area of pressure pumping, where it's pretty well known there have been some bottlenecks that have been constraining completion activity? And I'm wondering. Does your scale and long-term procurement in purchases in the Permian, did it help you avoid any of that bottleneck that you can share with us?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Let me respond to you in kind of a broader perspective is that, and it's very similar to what I said earlier, Rob, where developing these long-term supplier relationships is really critical to make sure that we're all in the same page in terms of the quality standards, the operating standards that we adhere to.","And when we see cost pressures, we are very quick to react upon, okay, how are we building in the value proposition in our go-forward plans and how do we offset those potential cost increases with more unique alternatives. It might be something as we've seen very significant in the Permian, and that's technology application. So there's been some \u2013 in 2017, by way of example, there has been some inflationary pressures largely in the unconventional business. But we have been able to offset that with these cost reductions that we are seeing in our drilling program by way of example.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. The final one I wanted to ask you is on the San Patricio cracker that I think follows Mont Belvieu, could you just quickly give us a sense of timing on that? And start looking like that as a \u2013 something that you're going to really accelerate when Mont Belvieu finishes, or is it really longer term?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. So this is \u2013 it's independent of where the Baytown cracker is. This is a \u2013 again, a part of the value chain. For the broader group on the phone, this is a joint \u2013 a proposed jointly owned petrochemical facility that would be a 1.8 million ton per annum ethylene steam cracker, and then derivative units monoethylene glycol plant and polyethylene plant. And we have \u2013 as you pointed out, we've selected a site in San Patricio County. And right now, we're beginning \u2013 we've been working with our partner to begin the planning for front-end engineering and design work.","So once we get to the point where we think we've got a good laid out plan, we've moved in the permitting phase. Once we get all the ducks in a row, then we'll make a decision on whether we'd move forward with funding. But it is very well positioned on the Gulf Coast to take full advantage of the feedstock that primarily would be coming from the Permian and the Eagle Ford.","Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay, thanks for taking my questions. That's great.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay, Rob. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones. Regarding Guyana and Phases 2 and 3, Jeff, will this be a lot like Angola where every two years you roll out another FPSO system? I mean, I know it's still early days, but I'm just curious.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. No \u2013 John, good morning. Very similar. I mean, if you think about my comments, you really want to get into that manufacturing mode very quickly. If you've got the resource \u2013 obviously, we're going to continue our exploration program, hopefully continue to grow the resource. You want to get into that manufacturing process because that will help continue to progress that learning curve and reduce your overall cost. So I keep on thinking about it like the Angola program that we did on Block 15.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay, great. And then one question on Brazil. Since you're getting a little further away from the initial discoveries by Petrobras and all that, are you assuming that the pay zones are going to be carbonates or clastics? And that's it for me.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","This is early days, and we've got to \u2013 like I said, we do have some of our own seismic that we are analyzing, and it's really going to be different wherever we are with the acreage that we've picked up. But in the outer Campos Basin, it's primarily carbonate pre-salt.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay, you've got a lot of experience in that, I was just curious. Petrobras certainly can use the help. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","All right. Thank you, John.","Operator","And there are no further questions, I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Woodbury, for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, lot of good questions this morning. I really do very much appreciate your time and your thoughts that you've put behind those questions. And, of course, we look forward to our communications \u2013 our ongoing communications, and we do appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. So, thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"8533":["Exxon Mobil Corp.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on Slide 2.","Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. Corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite the challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle.","We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals while we continue to capture market savings in the current environment. We also remain resolute and are drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I\u2019ll show you today the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective strategic investments while maintaining our setback commitment to safe reliable operations.","Moving to Slide 4, we provided an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw a modest global economic growth in the third quarter, while the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat although volatile whereas natural gas prices strengthen on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and Chemical commodity product margins remain strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat.","Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share, operation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion down 45% from the third quarter last year reflecting the cooperation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.3 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled 5.1 billion and debt was 46.2 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over quarter, cash balance is increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash including shareholder distribution of 3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion, debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion.","Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years.","In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million, and stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from the year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million. And all other items added $60 million driven by lower operating expenses.","Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased to 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day, as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts.","Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11, Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefitting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving now to Slide 12, sequentially, volumes decreased to 146,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped to 119,000 barrels per day, from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased to 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from the U.S. work programs.","So moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items including the lower operating costs reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. Today, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added to further 490 million, mostly from asset management gains and the lower expenses.","Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15, third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion, decreased 56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses.","Moving to Slide 16, Chemical earnings decreased to $46 million sequentially or stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity.","Moving now to Slide 17. Either delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating cost down especially in the current business climate with year-to-date CapEx and operating cost lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We stride to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total lifecycle cost. With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement for service sector on developing and implementing lower cost solutions. Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture the structural advantages while ensuring high integrity in our operations.","For example, by leveraging our fast-drill process and flat-time reduction initiatives, we realize cumulative drillings savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. By hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and liability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact.","On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of the proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of SEC in the Financial Accounting Standard Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated our reporting is consistent with SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of the reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12 month average of the first day of the month prices in a given year. As such, the low price environment impacted our 2015 reserve replacement resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas preserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels primarily in the U.S. reflecting the change in the natural gas prices, offset by liquidations of 1.9 billion barrels.","Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities are currently booked reserves such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands will not qualify as proved reserves at year end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with inner-field like production or certain other liquids and natural gas operations in the North America also may not qualify. However, as you know amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked into the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K.","Now regarding asset impairments, we follow U.S. GAAP successful efforts and under these standard assessments were made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different and as you see price basis for reserves that I just described.","As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long life assets, most at risk for potential impact. The price base is used in this assessment generally consisted with long-term price forecast published by third party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value, again this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. In light of continued weakness in the Upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-lived assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our yearend financial statements.","Moving to Slide 19, I would like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance major projects. First thing Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our confidence in the area stand of this world class resource. While results now confirmed the Liza discovery to be in excess of 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, these results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase of a 100,000 barrel per day development. Stena carrying drillship, we'll next move to the Payara exploration prospect located approximately 10 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payara is expected to be completed late this year or early next year after which the rig will move to another expression opportunity also on the Stabroek Block. In West Africa, the Owowo-3 well located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, which target deft in October and discover significant oil resource, this will build on our successful of Owowo-2 well drilled in 2012 on the neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrel oil discovery.","ExxonMobil continues to invest in this exploration activity to growth our prospect inventory across the globe, recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing counter-cyclically in large scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic survey covering diversity of logical basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Irving, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advance seismic imaging and high performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data.","In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large scale developments. The Kashagan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable re-starter production in October. Work is ongoing safely and gradually increased production to a target level with 370,000 barrels per day over the next year.","In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped four LNG cargos from Gorgon since August, and the second LNG train has now started. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron utilities and process module or UPM was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The top sites including UPM will next be mated with the concrete gravity based structure shown in the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to startup by year end 2017.","Moving to Slide 20, this illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash, and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program; as shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions and together with a moderate increase in debt financing supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through the cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015.","Moving now to Slide 21, so in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through the cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated 16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefitting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value based choices. ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of business environment. Year-to-date, capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","The first question is on the capital spending. You continue to see reductions sequentially in the CapEx year-to-date and it's obviously trending well below what you had expected at the beginning of the year. So, I guess, my first question is given the degree that\u2019s lower than your guidance, are you surprised by the degree of savings you have been able to achieve. And as we look ahead where are we in this cycle of CapEx savings?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, it's a real good question, Phil, and I\u2019d say that. First, I just want to recognize the organization for how focused they\u2019ve been on in particularly in the lower price environment continuing to capture benefits. We as you highlighted have been below our capital guidance yield, we\u2019ll be able to capture the many capital efficiencies, we\u2019ve continue to effectively respond to the market and capture market benefits. Importantly, Phil we continue to deliver the projects on budget and on schedule. And as I\u2019ve said, previously, we have adjusted the pace some of our investments in order to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value proposition given where we are in business cycle. If you look at our spending pattern, I would tell you that it is trending towards an outlook of between $20 billion to $21 billion.","Phil Gresh","20 to 21 for the full year?","Jeff Woodbury","For the full year.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And then as you look at the M&A activity, there is been a lot of M&A activity in the U.S. shale space lately, some of which has been acreage that's been contiguous for years. Maybe if you could just comment about how you\u2019re thinking about valuations in the U.S. shale today?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, Phil. We continue to be very alert towards there maybe some value propositions. We\u2019re looking for opportunities that would create incremental value. These opportunities need to compete with our existing investment portfolio and provide accretive strategic long-term value to us. We have been successful in over the recent past picking on bolt-on acquisitions particularly in unconventional business where we saw some of those unique synergies that added accretive value. We continue to be very alert to where there are opportunities, but as I said they really need to be able to add incremental value versus the portfolio that we currently have.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.","Q \u2013 Neil Mehta","Jeff, I always appreciated your views on the near-term well micro, I know, Rex had made some comments on London, talking about a more subdued market over the next couple of years. Can you just talk about how you see the bounce is over the next couple of years both from the supply and demand perspective? And then I'll have a follow up.","Jeff Woodbury","So, Neil, if you think back and look at where we have been here in the recent past, I\u2019ll start with demand. Demand has been generally reasonably strong, I mean when you think about a 10 year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 million to 1.1 million barrels per day. Since 2014, we've seen seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in recent past, if you look focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation with production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, we are seeing conversions in the second half. But I\u2019ll tell you that as you continue to progress that we will probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million barrels per day of supply.","Now, of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So, as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see conversions maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I had cautioned that we got to recognize, if they're still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013. That\u2019s got to come out of inventories at some point. And then of course, there is still uncertainties in the supply trend some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. and conventional will have an influence on the supply demand balance. So, I think when you heard Rex's comment, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near-term or medium-term.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate that, Jeff. The follow-up is related to exploration, if you could provide some additional color on both Guyana where there has been some exploration success with Liza-3 and the opportunity that you see in Nigeria that will be appreciated?","Jeff Woodbury","So, as I said in my prepared comments on Guyana, we were very pleased with the outcome of the Liza-3 well. The well is located just north of Liza-1. It has given us confidence in terms of areal extent, the reservoir quality and thus our communication that we believe we're in excess of 1 billion barrels now. We are completing the Liza-3 well as I indicated, we will move on to an exploration well which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real-time all of this well data and of course we took very expensive 3D seismic survey and all that\u2019s being integrated into our development planning. So in short I would say, we are very encouraged by not only Liza but the prospectivity on the block, and we see this is a high quality asset for the corporation.","Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I\u2019ll tell that this is a continuation of initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So, again very encouraging, as I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to a 1 billion oil discovery, and we will clearly integrate that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization and its integration can able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development here. So, I think it's a great example that about the value that bring from the general interest integration of the corporation.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel","I had two questions for you actually, the first was around the impact of the forward statement that you have in the comments you've made about the proved reserves. Just trying to understand in Canada, it looks like in 2015 you actually had some fairly signification positive reserve revisions, and so I'm just wondering, if the sort of $7 change that we've seen in WTI from year-to-year is the primary driver on why those reserves could now potentially be at risk and is crude kind of an all nothing thing, where would be the full 3.6 million barrels would be nothing, if you just comment around that?","Jeff Woodbury","The first point it as I mentioned we're seeing almost a 25% reduction in prices on a SEC basis year-to-date. And of course, we need to wait until we get the last two data points for that calculation. But given what we're seeing to this point, we felt it was appropriate to signal the potential impact from the SEC pricing basis on proved reserves. Yes, we did add some reserves in crude oil in 2015 and then the drop that we're potentially going to experience in 2016 is all due to the pricing basis. The second question, was, I'm sorry Jason was related to what?","Jason Gammel","Well, it was really you've referenced 3.6 billion barrels in the press release that's related Kearl, is that kind of an all or nothing thing, in another words, is it the full operation or?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, for the most part it is. For Kearl, itself you remember, it's very-very long flat plateau, so it would be all or nothing.","Jason Gammel","Sure. And are you positive on cash margin there right now?","Jeff Woodbury","We managed all of our assets to maximize cash flow. I will tell you that the organization has done a remarkable job across. Remember, if I step back a little bit, Kearl is an advantage asset from the standpoint that we did not put an upgrader in place. We used proprietary technology in order to avoid that upfront capital investment and the subsequent operating costs associated with it. The organization has -- just what we are really planning to do is continue to improve overall reliability to mine operation as well as significantly reduce our cost structure there. And they will continue to work on it like we do everywhere, and we manage these assets in order to maximize long-term return and very confident that will happen here at Kearl as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next questions from Evan Calio at Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Maybe my first question, it\u2019s a different slide to prior Phil's broad question. Just given the success you had adding resource at the drill bed in Guyana, Nigeria brownfield opportunity in places like PNG, pretty significant opportunities. Does that really contribute to your cautious stake so far on the asset market or the acquisition market, maybe broad next time going to ask more for U.S., but your view on the global market and kind of proceed need and or interest?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. It\u2019s a good perspective, Evan. I mean, I would tell you it\u2019s not either all or for us. We\u2019re looking at work and we get the greatest value, but I think you draw out a very important point as it relates to how we manage the portfolio and that is we maintain an active exploration program that is clearly define at high grading the value proposition in our portfolio, and you\u2019ve highlighted some of the important resources.","When we get to the point into assets life where we don\u2019t think that there is much incremental value and that\u2019s when we put it into our process of considering how else can you monetize that asset. But at the same time, we\u2019re also very alert to where there maybe some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think, the InterOil transaction is really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea and we continued to our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of existing LNG facility.","And in addition to that where we saw the opportunity for synergies value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there, and with the great success we\u2019ve had in terms of the operating reliability and in the cost structure there, I mean just as a, it puts at right up top of the portfolio. So, think about all of our actions, Evan, as what is the best value proposition and that may become organically or inorganically.","Evan Calio","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And as a follow-up on Liza, maybe just more detail here on how success affects your 2017 program across your various blocks. I mean, potentially adding other rig and any preliminary thoughts on that affects development plan that you filed in July, potentially adding a second FBSO and maybe just kind of cleaned up. There just any color on Payara or what you've learned from Skipjack?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So, as I indicated in the earlier question that, we\u2019re very encouraged with the progress that we\u2019re making at Guyana. I think you also know that we all also are very measured in our pace in terms of exploration and development. We want to make sure that we are leaving any value on the table. We also want to make sure in the exploration program that we don\u2019t get too ahead of ourselves. We want to make sure that we\u2019re fully integrating in the learnings into the regional geology, so that we upgrade our potential exploration program going forward. So, it\u2019s a pace program, it's making that those learnings being fully integrated, and then making that when we do discover additional resources or learn important information like we learned at Skipjack that we integrate that into, not only our expression program, but the scope of the full development. As it pretends to our initial phase development, it's been fairly consistent in the scope as it was conveyed in the application we filed for environmental review with the government, I\u2019ll tell you that this is real time, the organization is looking for ways to further enhance value. And as we progress that development planning and early engineering, we will learn more which will cause us to make adjustments. But very optimistic about the future in Guyana and we think we will bring a lot value to the government and people of Guyana.","Evan Calio","On the prospect?","Jeff Woodbury","On Payara.","Evan Calio","Yes.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, so I'd say it is a similar reservoir section to Liza also a stratigraphic trap. Other than that they manage it's really too early to say much more.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sam Margolin of Cowen & Co.","Sam Margolin","It's been a number of years since people had to think about an OPEC cut and filtering through partners, can you just remind us potential impact to the business and I am thinking specifically of Upper Zakum and some other progress that start up next year within number states?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes Sam, I am not really good at speculate on what OPEC might ultimately decide to do. I think what's important for you all to think about is that rest assured that, we are working to create incremental margin in the business. So, directionally, it could impact you on several ways. One, it could -- there could be retractions, but we're going to continue to make the value proposition. But at this point it's just too early to speculate on what we may or may not see from the agreement from the OPEC parties.","Sam Margolin","Understood, thanks very much. And then I am curious about this evaluation you mentioned in the press release about another chemical complex in the U.S. gulf. Does that reflect -- I recall at the Analyst Day, there were plans to ramp U.S. unconventional activity that were unveiled and -- is that -- so, is this new chemical complex potentially a reflection of a view associated with that at all and maybe some view on continued at least localized length in liquids and other associated some just coming out of your oil fields in the U.S., or is just a separate economic decision?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, I mean, it's, like most everything in ExxonMobil, that all start with our view on the long-term energy quite demand picture. And when you think about chemicals, the chemical demand growth based on our latest outlook as from an overall perspective, chemical growing about 1% above GDP. And from an ethylene perspective, we are expecting that chemical demand will grow just like you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware that would be three to four world-scale crackers per year.","So, that really is assets of the value proposition. First as you know, we are expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu, adding the derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high value metallocene polyethylene.","And then we announced to your question, we announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast that would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker -- ethylene steam cracker produce ethylene of about 1.8 million tons per annum. And a corresponding derivative units that would be built alongside that, but I think the value proposition is there, I think we're headed the game in terms of making some world-scale investments in this and a very strong component of our chemical business.","Operator","We'll move next to Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","So, Jeff, the new CapEx guidance seems to be following a trend that indicated goes lower again next year, but you've also said that in the recovering environment you could quickly pivot back to unconventionals in the lower 40. And I think the number I have in my head is an incremental 200,000 barrels a day net to Exxon by the end of '18. Can you just walk us through where do you stand on making that decision and whether I'm characterizing it correctly?","Jeff Woodbury","So, if you recall back in the March, Analyst Meeting, we provided an outlook through the end of the decade for our capital investment program. And if you remember, we had 2017 flat to down. And of course, the experience that we've realized during 2016 will be integrated into that and we'll update that outlook going into the next Analyst Meeting in March of next year. As you reflect on our ability to pivot, remember there's two components to our investment program, there's a very large component of being our long cycle investments, nothing has really slowed down in that regard and how we're working through the maximizing the value proposition for those investments.","And as I said earlier we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short cycle side you may recall and I think remember you're picking up with as in our unconventional program we shared in March that, we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher price environment in our unconventional program to the order magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So, we've got a lot of flexibility in our short cycle program and when you think about what really sets the balance between short and long cycle investment.","The way I think about it from a short cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don\u2019t want to go much beyond that. I think as you try and also maximize value. So, I think we're very positioned if you recall in the second quarter of last year, our last earnings call, we shared with you some statistics around our unconventional program where we continue to drop the costs and we have a pretty sizeable ready inventory to go ahead and move on.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up if I may on Guyana again, I wonder if I could just pull a little bit to try and clear up some comments that your partner made. So, really about next steps on timing, my understanding is that you\u2019re still on location on Liza-3 looking for deeper objectives. So my question is, have you -- are you done there -- have you found lost [indiscernible] water contract and maybe comment on your partners suggestions that the range of Liza is now at the top end of your prior disclosed range?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. I\u2019ll start with the second half of the question and that is, right now, our guidance is that we\u2019re likely above a billion barrels and really no more detail beyond that at this point, Doug. On the Liza-3 well, we did go ahead and deepen oil, we were targeting a higher risk deeper interval that had not previously have been penetrated on the block. What I would share with you is that the results were positive, and it does support the presence of oil bearing sands deeper in the section. But it is still very early this is real time evaluation that still ongoing and that information will be used integrate not only in the Liza but also in the rest of our exploration.","Doug Leggate","So, did you find your water contact or is it another appraisal well block?","Jeff Woodbury","Did we find in oil or contacting the deeper interval?","Doug Leggate","No, no, in the original session?","Jeff Woodbury","We were targeting, it goes back to injective of Liza-3 well, we were targeting water in the lower most sands, and we did encounter that water in the sand that we\u2019re still evaluating the results from the well, Doug. But it\u2019s suffice to say, we\u2019re pleased with the results and are consistent with our perjure expectations.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next Brad Heffern at RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","Just continue the probing on the deeper interval, is that included in the 1 billion plus barrel resource range?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, to the extent that I'd say in excess of a billion barrels, yes.","Brad Heffern","Okay. And I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail around Skipjack. Can you describe it all what happen there geologically and why it was ultimately a dry whole? And how did it inform the future drilling plan were prospects eliminated based on the results, was the drilling schedule changed?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, Skipjack did not find the commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, but it did find the same excellent reservoir quality sands that we see in Liza. We have -- as we have been saying we have numerous additional prospects as well as different play types on the block. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by the success is today as well as the future exploration wells. There is really nothing more to share on Skipjack at this point. We are still doing some final evaluation and of course as I alluded to earlier, those learnings are being fully integrated into our exploration program.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Understood. And then switching to Nigeria, certainly very large apparent production impact in this quarter, can you talk about what the current status is of your production there? I know you've at least reportedly recently lifted the force there.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So, when you think about our liquid shortfall versus the third quarter of last year as well as sequentially, it was all primarily driven to the downtime in Nigeria? And there were two third party impacts, the first one I think I may have mentioned in the second quarter earnings call. The first one had to do with the third part rig that was trending that impact or export line which had an impact on our production. And that issue has been addressed and the production is back on. The second one had to do with the third party impact line, and let me just say that we are still investigating with the government, we do not believe that was accidental or due to mechanical failure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","I guess that's been press release out of Mozambique saying that you have done a deal with [NI], so I am just wondering, if there is any comments that you can make in public on that?","Jeff Woodbury","I know there has been fair bit of media interest in this. There is really nothing that I can comment on with respect to those media reports. You may recall also that ExxonMobil and Rosneft were given the rights to negotiate for a PSC on three offshore blocks in Mozambique, and we are actively working that opportunity that we're participating in 3D survey. Right now, they started up in January and it's still underway.","Ed Westlake","Okay. And then second question, I mean I see a lot of ways that you can't get on the offence and we've just spoken about it a lot of them on the coal, maybe we haven't spoke enough about integrating value growth in the Downstream. But there is this issue around impairments, so if I may thanks but putting that on the agenda. One of the triggers that you have in your 10-K for impairments is operating losses. And also the U.S. has been an operating loss very much of 2015 and 2016. And then oil sands may or may not be an operating loss that we didn\u2019t get a disclosure, but let's say it is. I am just looking in your accounts, your net capitalized cost to your consolidate subsidiaries in the U.S. is 83 billion and then in Canada is $36 billion. So maybe just walk us through the approach that of how you would go through those impairments say the trigger was there? And how there would be cooperation will think about the type of impact you might have?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, well, I mean, as I said in my prepared comments Ed, we did an assessment in 2015 and in that assessment as I was very clear in my comments, we saw that the cash flow fully covered the carrying cost of those assets. As I indicated Ed, we are going to do another analysis very similar to the comprehensive assessment we get in 2015, and we will report on any results. But you can see some pretty good detail of what we go through and in fact maybe go to look at given your comments in our 10-K that really defiance the process pretty clearly. But I really don\u2019t have any more to share on the specifics of the mechanics that we go through. But rest assured, we are in full compliance with the rules and standards of both SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.","Ed Westlake","I guess we could take the RP ratio as a proxy for the years of undiscounted cash flow and then we can make our own forecast of how much cash flow you make it at the strip and compare that to the carrying value would be at least a first approach to it. I guess I just worried that if you de-booked reserve then you'll less reserve life to multiply by the cash flow to then on an undiscounted basis carry against the asset value?","Jeff Woodbury","I don\u2019t have anything else more to add on this, Ed. We'll continue to be transparent on this. That was the whole purpose of putting the forward statement in there. It was a -- it's part of our normal planning and budgeting process to look at profitability of our assets and that sometimes causes us to step back like we did in 2015 and do a more comprehensive assessment.","Operator","We'll go next to Asit Sen of CLSA.","Asit Sen","So, two unrelated questions, first on global gas, could you remind us what percent of your LNG volume is not under a long-term contract and given slowdown in traditional Asian markets, particularly Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Are you seeing more new-term opportunities in other regional markets? And just wondering, if you have any incremental thoughts on European gas picture? And then I've a follow-up.","Jeff Woodbury","On the global gas, I mean first let me remind everybody that from our energy outlook we have gas grown about 1.6%. And LNG growth just under three times where we are in current LNG capacity. As you go forward and we said it many times, Asit, that there are LNG businesses as a very important of our portfolio. I don't have a specific breakdown of our total gas production between pipeline sales and LNG contract sales. But recognize that a large part of our Asian gas coming from Qatar and Papua New Guinea is under long-term contracts and a good part of them are liquids linked. So, that's about all I can give you on that. In terms of the markets, clearly Asia-Pacific market is an important market for LNG. We've got a very expansive marketing organization to go ahead and identify value opportunities.","We're primarily interested in locking in long term contracts either point-to-point or portfolio sale. You may recall that before we take a project to -- an LNG project to final investment decision that we will lock in a majority of those volumes on a long-term contract. We've been really developed a very strong reputation credibility with the buyers through our ability to deliver these projects on schedule and our responsiveness to managing through the contract terms, we've got a new operation center that we put in place in Asia-Pacific to facilitate the transactions with our many buyers.","Asit Sen","And my second question is on Brazil, it appears Brazil is opening up in area where Exxon is not really involved, even Guyana fraction that you have now, could you update us on your latest views on Brazil?","Jeff Woodbury","Brazil is a country that's really blessed with a large gamma resources and it's really high quality resource. Remember that how we approach our investment activities, just want to making sure that we get attractive returns for our shareholders. The trends in Brazil have been encouraging we continue to look for where there could be good value opportunities in Brazil and certainly if we think that we can get in engage there on resources or exploration activities that will be competitive on a global perspective to the other opportunities that we\u2019ve got in front of us, so we certainly will consider that.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next to Ryan Todd at Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks Jeff. Maybe if I could follow up on an earlier question in terms of CapEx trends and activity levels. You\u2019ve seen as it has been highlighted before I mean your CapEx here is kind of well over official guidance and even at 20 billion to 21 billion for the year is still relatively low and impressive at this point where you actually cover the CapEx and dividend here in the quarter. So, I guess first I mean I guess with your effectively breaking even in the current environment I know that this is one quarter, but how should we be think about how you manage additional cash flow in the 2017 in oil and gas as covers. How do you prioritize in increase in activity levels versus growth and distribution says reduction and leverage?","Jeff Woodbury","It\u2019s a good question, Ryan. And I know we\u2019ve talked about before, but it\u2019s always good to update on this issue. As you know, let me just first talk about capital allocation, it's one of from our cash flow from operations. The first thing that the corporation wants to do is go ahead and pay a reliable and grow on dividend. The next thing is the remaining cash is praetors to a investment program as gotten into point where we believe that we have maximize the value proposition for investments. If we\u2019ve got enough cash to go ahead and invest in to fund an investment program then the remaining cash will be put forward to either stock buyback or share buybacks or paying down our debt.","If we don\u2019t have enough cash as you\u2019ve seen us doing this in the recent past as we go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt because the service cost associated with that debt is more than benefited rather the return we get from these investments. So, it\u2019s important to recognize that while we are very mindful of prudently managing our cash, we also believe it\u2019s very important for us to continue to invest through to the cycle and we do that in a very measurable way that we\u2019re not remaining value on the table. And therefore my comments I made earlier about making sure that we\u2019re optimizing value in the bottom of the cycle.","Ryan Todd","All right. Thanks. Sorry, maybe the follow-up on that, you\u2019ve mentioned earlier on the call how you\u2019ve guys have done a good job I mean you\u2019ve generally maintained a decent amount of investment level on kind of your long cycle type projects, but when you\u2019re looking at this point that you\u2019re pre-FIB into a projects. Can you speak to the progress that you\u2019ve seen on large-scale and conventional projects in terms of cost deflation or evolution of fiscal terms towards enhancing in a competitiveness of this part of the portfolio? Have you seen what you needed at this point to kind of go and kick off the investment in that to continue new investment in that part of the portfolio or is that more that maybe to see at this plan?","Jeff Woodbury","Let's bring it up from the component showing, first I would say that we want to make sure that all the learnings that we getting from our capital efficiency afford year-to-date or being in graded into those projects, and we have talked about how we do this to reduce the upfront capital investment, like I have talked in the past about progressing projects in parallels that we can benefit from the learning convinces, subsequent project. So capturing the market response, capturing the capital efficiencies that we build in and the low price environment as you highlighted there is a time to where we may want to go back and purchase some additional resources or reducing expression like in a Owowo, they additional resource to make the investment, the project investment even more robust.","The last thing I had mentioned is the application of technology has been fundamental -- absolutely fundamental to our past success and into the future. And if you think about where you are getting those benefits across the full value chain I mean from the Downstream, our Chemical business where we use the proprietary technology to provide high value metallocene to our unconventional business with fracking technology. So, the application in the growth of these technology solutions has been a key element. And sometime some of these projects are really waiting on some of the technology work is underway. So we make great progress, I think we are very well positioned, we got a solid diverse portfolio in which we ahead and selectively invest into the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Anish Kapadia","Hi, Jeff. Just want to -- I had a question with regards to the way you look at your impairments versus the way that you look at acquisitions. Just want to square the fact that you haven't written down assets 2015, given you've got I suppose a fairly constructive view on the commodity prices with the kind of the opposing side that you haven't been dealt over last kind of year or so given that you haven't seen attracted enough assets from the market. Can you just talk about how those two things kind of work together?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, from my standpoint there are two separate processes. Our asset management activity is a function of making sure that we are capturing opportunities as I said earlier at a competitive charge for existing portfolio. The objective here is making sure that we are growing shareholder value and if we think that we can acquire in asset like in our oil transaction then we can add incremental long term value, and we will go ahead and pursue those type of opportunities. Our determination of asset impairment which we talked about is a comprehensive process that we follow. And as I said the detail in our 2015 10-K and it's a separate process, it's not informing or influencing or asset management activity.","Anish Kapadia","Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up on Nigeria, you have -- you made the number of discoveries in Nigeria kind of a number of things that you highlighted just potential developments. Could we expect any of these to be functioned for development in 2017 and if so which are the ones that are more progressed?","Jeff Woodbury","So, Anish, as you highlight, there're a number of projects that we have in our portfolio that we've shared with you all in our S&L. And several of those have gone through various stages of development planning to capture some incremental value. I would tell you that just like any project, there're a lot of variables that we have to address and some of those variables may take some time. But we continue actively work with the co-benchers. Any government on the Nigeria portfolio, -- I think Owowo-3 well is a good example of how we've added some additional value to our portfolio and strengthened that project opportunity.","Anish Kapadia","And then any of that could be sanctioned next year?","Jeff Woodbury","Anish, we don\u2019t pre-communicate our FIDs, but the portfolio that we share within the S&L, we've got various stages of development planning underway in those projects, some of them are in feed; some of them are even more advanced like one of them like Tengiz has been FID. But we don't provide advance guidance on our FIDs.","Operator","We'll go next to Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess maybe coming back a little bit of to sort of broader cash flow, CapEx questions here, remember people have asked the question, is CapEx, is it troughing here? Does it go up? I guess to some extent that's going to depend on oil pricing cash flow, but how do you look at it in a world where prices have increased quite a bit from the beginning of the year? And then balancing cash flow, CapEx any sort of asset disposition plans? And then can you lay out any of the parameters for when we should anticipate a recovery in the share repurchase program like what do we need to see?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I mean, I really want to be careful not to speculate on what prices we'll do in the future. But I will tell you as we discussed a little bit earlier, that our investment -- our long cycle investment plans are progressing. When we believe those investments prior to point of maturity where we optimize on value, then we'll make an FID decision. Recall that, we're making those decisions by our long-term view on supply and demand. We're very constructive on long-term energy demand. And that's what really informing those long cycle investments, it's not what current prices are doing.","Now having said that, we've balanced that with other factors that we may be able to capture some incremental value in the near term; and it causes us to paste those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're fully capturing the value. On the short cycle investments as I alluded to earlier, and we want to keep activity levels in the down cycle commensurate with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing since that we're enhancing value across the full portfolio. But it doesn't make sense to do much more beyond that. If you recognize, you want to optimize value. But as I responded to Doug earlier, we're very well poised to go ahead and pick up that in the short cycle investments and supported by the business climate and we\u2019ve got flexibility to do so.","Roger Read","Sure. Well, the correct response on prices is always is just to say fluctuate right. But in terms of thinking about the share repo side of it, I mean is that you need to be at a point where you\u2019re comfortable or you can let say maintain roughly flat production levels and generate free cash flow or I mean how should we think about balancing production return cash flow? And I\u2019m think about the more normalize environment which should appears where headed to over the next year or two?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So, go back to my discussion on the capital allocation approach with the buybacks. That\u2019s determine in each quarter considering a number of backs including these company\u2019s current financial position, our capital requirements, our dividend requirements as well as what we see in the near-term business outlook. And it\u2019s a all those variables that are really inform the Company as to whether we believe it\u2019s appropriate to go ahead and distribute some of the benefits of the corporation back to the shareholder in a buyback. Remember, the corporation does not believe we should be holding large cash reserves if we don\u2019t have an immediate use to put it to work on and we\u2019ll go ahead and distribute it. Now, to be clear that consideration will also be mindful of the merits of going ahead and paying down debt if appropriate.","Roger Read","Okay. Thanks. And just unrelated follow-up, regarding the Kearl assets, is the indicator there best to use a Bachmann price or the use a WCS price and that\u2019s just for us to do our calculations?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I mean well I think the benchmark is reason the WCS benchmark is quite a reasonable.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next to Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Two quick one hopefully. For Liza, do you have already sufficient well data from Liza and Liza-1 and Liza-2 appraisal, if you need to meet FID on any production system? Or do you need additional appraisal wells?","Jeff Woodbury","On the Liza, Guyana, at this time I don\u2019t think we believe that additional appraisal wells required prior to FID decision. But I would tell you that, as I said earlier Paul that, we will continue to integrate the data that we\u2019ve got and there may be a point where we step back and say given the risk profile we may want to put some additional data. But right now, it\u2019s not planned.","Paul Cheng","Okay. On Permian and Bakken, can you tell us what is your number of rig and what is the current production?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So Permian and Bakken, I think we\u2019ve got a total of 10 rigs going in the third quarter.","Paul Cheng","And what\u2019s there production?","Jeff Woodbury","And production on a gross operated basis the Permian and Bakken is about 240,000 barrels a day.","Paul Cheng","And one of your pretty large competitors that was talking about in the preparation of indeed that they\u2019re going to add some additional weight by the vendor. Just curious that whether Exxon have any preparation of the increasing activities at this point?","Jeff Woodbury","Paul we are -- as I just said a moment ago, we are very well positioned to respond and we think it's appropriate but I am just not going to forecast whether we plan to add anything in the near term.","Operator","And our next question comes from Iain Reid of Macquarie.","Iain Reid","Just a quick question, I was intrigued to see a news report that Exxon is considering setting up a trading organization, and I was listening to the answers to question on LNG and point-to-point deliveries and coverage by long term contract. Can you foresee a situation where Exxon rather like some of your competitors actually takes some of the equity volumes itself from LNG development and then kind of redistribute via kind of other mechanism? Because other thing Exxon ever done that, it's always been a kind of a point-to-point LNG player or never kind of played in the kind of trading or diversion game. So be interested in a comment on that?","Jeff Woodbury","Thanks Iain. I\u2019ll tell you that by and large we're price seekers. We don\u2019t typically speculate. We are taking positions in markets. Beyond that in terms of the inter working and how we want to manage that going forward, there is really nothing more that I can share. We continue to be very mindful from a LNG basis, very mindful what is of interest to the buyers. And I think referred to being open to the portfolio sales, but we are still very much interested in locking in those contracts on a long term.","Iain Reid","Okay thanks. And just a follow-you, I just want ask you a question about the long-term on kashagan. Obviously, you're just ramping up the initial phase now, but what is the consortium thinking about in terms of going further on that, because the result is obviously could support a much larger level of production, and given that\u2019s you already got the facility on-stream, must thinking about in next phase of that, so that would be interesting?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, to be real transparent, I mean the joint venture company and the shareholders have been very focused. And I am sure you will appreciate this on getting the initial phase fully up on production and matching capacity. As I said in my comments that will be about 370,000 barrels a day by the end of 2017, but there is a second tranche to that subsequences to reaching 370 and that is with additional gas reinjection facility for gas that will take us to about 450. And certainly the joint venture company and the all shareholders are very focused on, given that we have restarted production and how do we move forward and really maximize value and that will include at the right time, looking at additional resource development.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mr. Woodbury for any closing remarks.","Jeff Woodbury","Once again, I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. I thought the questions were very thoughtful and insightful. We of course appreciate your engagement. And I want to thank you again for you interest in ExxonMobil.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation."],"8374":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","","Jeffrey Woodbury \u2013 VP, IR and Secretary","Analysts","","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Alastair Syme \u2013 Citi","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the quarter. And I\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on Slide 2.","Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our third quarter and year-to-date performance. First, ExxonMobil\u2019s financial results reflect the strength of the integrated business model, which creates unique competitive advantages and allows us to generate long-term shareholder value regardless of market fluctuations over the business cycle.","Second year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales fully covered our net investments in the business and robust shareholder distributions. And third, we continue to meet our operational and projective development objectives. Upstream production volumes for 2014 remain on track to average 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by year end, as the company delivers new production from project start-ups and work programs. All of which are enhancing our financial performance.","Now moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economy showed mixed results in the third quarter. In the U.S., the economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, however China\u2019s economic growth tapered slightly, while the European economy showed further sign of weakness.","As you know crude oil prices decreased sharply and Henry Hub gas prices also weakened. The WTI spread to brand, narrowed whereas global industry refining margins were essentially flat as stronger European margins were offset by weaker margins in the U.S. And finally, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened during the quarter.","Turning now to the financial results shown on slide 5. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings were $8.1 billion or $1.89 per share. Corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, were $3 billion.","CapEx was 9.8 billion in the quarter and just over $28 billion year-to-date, down 14% when compared to the first 9 months of 2013. Cash flow from operations in asset sales were $12.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $5 billion and debt was just shy of $22 billion.","Next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased by $1.3 billion from 6.3 billion to $5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program, yielded $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.","Uses included net investments in the business, of $7.9 billion, and our shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding\u2019s are expecting to continue at $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Now moving to slide 7 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings of $8.1 billion, increased by $200 million from the third quarter of 2013 as you can see higher downstream, and chemical margins were partly offset by lower upstream liquids realizations and higher corporate and financing expenses.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, earnings decreased by $710 million. Lower gains on upstream asset sales were partially offset by higher downstream and chemical earnings. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","Turning now to the upstream financial operating results starting on slide 9. Upstream earnings in the third quarter were $6.4 billion, a decrease of $297 million versus the third quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $670 million driven by lower liquid prices, and in this regard on a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations decreased by $10.48 per barrel. And worldwide natural gas realizations decreased by $0.42 per thousand cubic feet, as lower European realizations were partly offset by higher U.S. gas prices.","Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by $340 million. Higher margin, production growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola, and North America as well as the net over lift, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activities, lower entitlements and fuel decline.","Moving to slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, our oil equivalent production decreased by 1% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Importantly liquid\u2019s production was up 14,000 barrels per day, increased production from onshore U.S. work programs, Canada and Angola were partly offset by divestment in tax in Iraq and Canada as well as scheduled maintenance in U.S., Nigeria and Russia.","Natural gas production was down 319 million cubic feet per day as expected field decline in the U.S. and unfavorable entitlement impacts from pipeline gas in Qatar were partly offset by new high margin production from Papua New Guinea LNG.","In short our volumes performance demonstrates the progress being made to high grade our portfolio mix with higher margin liquids and liquids linked gas production. As previously indicated we remain on track to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2014.","Turning now, to sequential comparison starting on slide 11, our upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion dollars versus the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $850 million with worldwide crude realizations down $7.29 per barrel and natural gas realizations down to $0.56 per 1000 cubic feet.","Again, favorable sales mix effects, increased earnings by $460 million reflecting profitable growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola and Canada and a net overlift partially offset by lower seasonal demand in Europe.","All other items reduced earnings by $1.1 billion primarily driven by the absence of the prior quarter Hong Kong power divestment gain. Upstream after tax per earnings per barrel were $18.65 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving on to slide 12, volumes were essentially flat versus the second quarter. However liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day due to growth in Angola and U.S. partly offset by higher planned maintenance in the U.S., Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas volumes were down 155 million cubic feet per day reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe partly offset by a full quarter of Papua New Guinea LNG volumes.","Moving now to the downstream financial, and operating results starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter, over $1 billion, up $432 million from the third quarter of 2013. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $820 million whereas volume and mix effects added another $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by $490 million which mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Turning to slide 14, sequentially third quarter downstream earning increased by $313 million, higher non-used refining margins increased earnings by $310 million positive volume and mix effects due to lower maintenance were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and another effects.","Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results shown on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion up a $175 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to high commodity product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by increased planned maintenance activities.","Moving to slide 16, sequentially our Chemical earnings increased by $359 million due to higher commodity and specialty product margins.","Moving now to an update on our year-to-date cash flow growth shown on slide 17, strong year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales of $41.5 billion more than covered the net $22 million invested in the business and $17.6 billion distributed to our shareholders. Mainly cash is used for other financing activities including debt reduction.","Overall free cash flow of $19.4 billion represented increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This year year-to-date free cash will growth, reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and disciplined capital allocation.","Turning now to slide 18, I\u2019d like to provide an update on project startups that will deliver profitable growth. We remain on track for a record startup year and planning to add 300,000 net-equivalent barrels per day of production capacity, that is indicative of the diversity of our resource base. We continue to demonstrate our world class project execution capabilities and have made significant progress during the year.","For June, three major projects were started up as you know Papua New Guinea LNG came online a few months ahead of schedule and reached full capacity in July. In Angola, the CLOV reached full capacity in third quarter just a few months after first production and in Malaysia Damar started up in the first quarter.","Recently, we achieved several additional project milestones. In Indonesia, the second well pad at the Banyu Urip project started up adding another 10,000 barrels per day of early production. Banyu Urip is now producing nearly 40,000 barrels per day.","Construction of the central processing facilities as shown in picture is near complete and uploading offshore storage vessel which recently towed to its location for a final hookup. The project will reach full fuel capacity of 165,000 barrels per day in 2015.","In Malaysia the tap is to enhance to oil recovering project which is the first large scale UR project in the country was completed. Project is utilizing a water alternating gas injection process to sweep remaining oil reserves to producing wells, increasing overall recovery.","Also, the Qatargas II maintenance project was completed, enabling the venture to maintain 10 million tons of annual LNG production for the years to come. Project added well capacity a new onshore facilities for sulfur handling.","In the fourth quarter we also expect to start up several additional major projects closing out our 2014 plans. In our offshore Sakhalin project in Russia, the first production well at Arkutun-Dagi is currently being drilled, offshore facility hook up and commissioning activities are nearing completion following the installation of platform top size this summer. Startup is anticipated around year-end and the field is expected at add 90,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production.","In the Gulf of Mexico hook up and commissioning activities for both the Hadrian South and Lucius developments are underway. At Hadrian South we finished drilling the two subsea wells earlier this year. And installation of the subsea facilities for tieback to the Lucius far is now complete. Startup of both projects is expected before year-end.","In Canada the Cold Lake Nabiye project is moving into the final stages of completion. Hydro testing and commissioning activities are occurring in support of plant startup and steam injection is expected around the end of the year. This project will add another 40,000 barrels per day to Cold Lake production.","I would now like to turn to slide 19 for an update on U.S. onshore liquids growth; we are generating significant cash flow by growing high margin liquids production in the U.S. primarily in unconventional place.","In the Bakken our resource base is now approaching 1 billion oil crude and barrels and gross operated production is up more than six fold since we first entered the play in 2008. The Bakkan remains our most active conventional play and is the liquids growth engine in U.S. Gross operated production has increased 38% year-on-year reflecting higher activity levels. Currently running 13 rigs up from 10 in the third quarter of 2013, net increase, new wells brought online by 25% year-on-year.","We continue to achieve strong results and increased efficiencies through our development drilling in the core areas. Optimizing completions and leveraging pad development, in this regard drilling and completion costs have been reduced by 25% since 2011. We also successfully employed our proprietary extract technology to reduce costs by eliminating the need for multiple plugs, normally required for fracking.","In the Woodford shale, we\u2019re running 10 rigs, gross operated oil equivalent production in the liquids rich Ardmore Marietta area has increased by 25% year-on-year, driven my more completions, strong well performance and the move to pad development.","Year two, well completion times have decreased significantly, reducing costs and increasing the number of wells drilled per rig year. Although rig counts have remained basically flat, we have increased the number of new wells by 33% year-on-year.","In 2014, we also increased drilling activity in the Marietta basin, timed with the completion of infrastructure there. We\u2019re encouraged by the initial work in Marietta, which has an even higher proportion of liquids in the Ardmore area.","And lastly 8% year-on-year on a large legacy production base reflecting tripling the number of rigs we had in the third quarter of 2013, along with approximately six conventional productions. We continuously look for opportunities to add attractive acreage 4,000 net acres in the heart of the expanding Wolfcamp play, as shown on the map in blue.","Turning now to slide 20 for an update on our exploration activities. In Romania, drilling activities at Domino-2 are complete; the well was drilled to gather more information on the 2012 Domino discovery to assess the size of the resource and its commerciality. Domino-2 is being followed by the Pelican South-1 wildcat, which is currently being drilled. Additional exploration targets are also planned.","In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made a seventh discovery in block 2. Giligiliani-1 well discovered gas in the western part of block 2. The well confirmed an additional trillion cubic feet of gas in place, bringing the total estimated resource in place up to 21 trillion cubic feet.","In Argentina, drilling and testing continue in the Vaca Muerta, where we have drilled and successfully tested 2 ExxonMobil operated horizontal wells. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average initial rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, and is currently on the long-term test. And I\u2019ll note that this is the highest unconventional oil production rate test in Argentina.","The La Invernada X-3 well began testing at September with encouraging initial results, although still clinging up. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing later this year and into 2015.","And finally, in Russia, we successfully drilled the University-1 well in the Kara Sea. I can confirm that the well did encounter hydrocarbons, however results are under evaluation, it would be premature to comment any further at this time. Well was safely plugged and abandoned and the rig has departed to location.","So in conclusion, today\u2019s presentation provides a summary of our year-to-date performance, ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial operating results, demonstrate the value of our integrated business model and unique competitive advantages.","Total earnings were $26 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. And the upstream production of 3.9 million, oil-equivalent barrels per day remain in line with our plan as we add new production from project start-ups and work programs.","We continue to improve our production mix with unit profitability increasing from $18 per barrel in 2013 to just over $21 per barrel year-to-date. A strong operating results combine with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generate a robust free cash flow of $19.4 billion, an increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This favorable performance enabled us to maintain industry leading, shareholder distributions at $17.6 billion.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Mr. Woodbury [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll first go to Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, and may I say welcome on behalf of [Indiscernible] to the new role.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you Ed.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","So obviously your net income margins probably surprised most people, they seem to go up as the oil price pulled back. You\u2019ve got new projects obviously coming on-stream, and I can see that your exploration expense was a little bit low, which is kind of non-cash. But can you give us some color as to why you think net income per barrel went up in the U.S. and international? Little surprised.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, I mean we broadly say Ed that it starts with the integrated business model. You\u2019re all very aware that we\u2019ve got a very cyclical nature of our business, and our business model is focused on creating shareholder value by participating through that whole value chain. So it provides robust earnings performance despite the cyclical nature. If you think about just the overall upstream unit performance, as I said, we\u2019re up year-to-date versus 2013, by about $3 per barrel.","Half of that is asset management impacts, another half improved profitability, primarily due to improved liquids mix as well as higher profitability around our gas projects, really good progress by the organization, in improving the higher margin production, as I said in the presentation.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay and a second unrelated question just around Kearl, I mean obviously that is a big project and there is the Kearl expansion and potential de-bottlenecking maybe just give us an update of the latest status, and a bit more detail there, thank you.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Sure, thanks for that Ed. Kearl, as we\u2019ve said many times, is a long life asset, it\u2019s advantaged. Obviously it\u2019s advantaged because of the prior technology that we\u2019ve implemented where it foregoes the need for an upgrade. Overall, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re making progress quarter-on-quarter on Kearl.","Currently we\u2019re consistently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day, as we ramp up production there; we\u2019re clearly identifying opportunities where we can further enhance the facility reliability. I will say that we did take a turnaround in September, for planned maintenance, and all of these learning\u2019s are being fully integrated into the expansion project.","As you know, we talked about the importance of capturing the learning\u2019s from the initial development, and that was a key element of their investment decision to progress right into the expansion. Likewise as we get more and more comfort with the operability of the initial development, those learning\u2019s are being integrated in the expanse project as well.","So overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the asset, as I said; it\u2019s a long life asset that\u2019s going to provide very stable productions. And quite frankly Ed, we\u2019re in our sweet spot right now, we have \u2013 this is what we do very, very well in terms of our project execution, and then optimizing our operations to make sure that we maximize the value \u2013","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey good morning.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Phil.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Just kind of following up on the question about the margin lift in the quarter and past couple of quarters, just kind of wondering how you would think about, how we should think about the next year or so. And what\u2019s the potential benefit you could see, in particular from cost levers. As we\u2019ve seen the oil price come down, what leverage do you think you can pull around cost and\/or CapEx?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah Phil that\u2019s a great question, I mean clearly the market has seen some changes with prices. I don\u2019t think any of us should be surprised given the oversupply and continued economic weakness. I\u2019ll go right back Phil, toward the value of our integrated business model, which really does position us well to capture shareholder value; it is the cyclical nature of the business. Quite frankly the market controls the price, and what we need to focus on are the variables that we do control.","And to your question, those include things like effectively managing our development and operating costs, maximizing our reliability, and then optimizing the value of the molecules through the integrated business model. All along that, that has been a fundamental main stay of our corporation. And then as a key element of how we manage that, and it\u2019s always around optimizing that the cost structure within our assets that we are maximizing the value from the resources.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","And just as a clarification could you tell us how much of the 2015 CapEx is locked in at this point, what kind of flexibility you have?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, so just a little bit more about the CapEx, if I could step back a moment, as you all know our CapEx has grown through years, and it peaked in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. And that was largely driven by a deliberate decision to progress several high value upstream research projects, upstream resource projects that were ready and matured to move forward. And now we\u2019re trailing down to what I consider a more of a normal spin pattern of just shy of $37 billion.","Now the upstream has dropped off a little bit more than the down \u2013 it\u2019s dropping off little more than that as the downstream in chemical are increasing their spend pattern. But you can appreciate a lot of these projects that are in current progress, that if that CapEx profile will continue into the future. Our guidance is no different Phil, in terms of about just shy of $37 billion a year for the next couple, and we continue to invest to the cyclical nature of our business.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then my second question would be, you obviously have a very strong balance sheet and stronger free cash flow generation, arguably stronger than most of your peers. So you\u2019re in a pretty unique position to be potentially more aggressive in this period of weaker oil prices. So maybe you could comment about how you would think about that bigger picture, whether it\u2019s the buyback program or opportunities with the portfolio?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah Phil, I would tell you, I think you assess it up pretty good, clearly the financial flexibility we have with our current debt levels in our triple credit rating position us very well to respond to potential investment opportunities, whether that be additional resource developments, investment in our downstream or chemical business that provide us advantaged benefits to the industry. It really requires us to be able to maintain a very disciplined approach to capital allocation through the business cycle, while at the same time providing industry leading shareholder distributions.","So if you think about our capital allocation approach, it\u2019s first and foremost, invest in all of our attractive business opportunities that are accretive to average unit profitability and returns. Second is to continue to pay our reliable and growing dividends, and I\u2019ll remind everybody that our dividends have grown about 10% a year over the last 10 years. And then lastly is, to return the cash to our shareholders through our share buyback program.","As we\u2019ve said in the past, our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding for both of our capital requirements and our shareholder distributions. But we\u2019ll access the financial markets when and if needed to meet commitments or capture opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll now hear from Doug Terreson, ISI.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","So my question, regards to margin and profitability improvement as well. And you covered the mix of effects on new projects in \u2013 Abu Dhabi but you also mentioned asset management. So my question is whether these benefits that you guys are getting from asset management or of the strategic or operational variety. And so just some clarification on what you mean by that?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah so as you know asset management has been a core component of how we manage our business. We\u2019re constantly looking across the portfolio to assess how we could maximize the value of our assets, either through development or finding alternative means to go ahead and monetize those assets. So as a result, as you know, we have, had a very healthy program in terms of our divestment activities. In terms of our unit profitability, as I said year-on-year 2013, 2014-2013 the part of that increase in unit profitability was associated with our asset management efforts.","By the way the example Doug, let me just remind you over the last 10 years, for instance, in our downstream we have reduced our refining capacity by more than 1 million barrels a day. Associated with divestment of about 20 plus refineries, we\u2019ve divested over 200 fuel terminals, 38 blending plants and 6000 miles of pipeline. So it\u2019s a very active program to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value to shareholder, but also positioning us strategically to continue to perform at an industry leading pace in the future.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Let me ask you one other question about this. So the company\u2019s always done really well optimizing cost, but has there been, and has always been, a pressure on your cost for that reason but, is there a, maybe a step up in the effort to deliver sustained cost improvements that also may be affecting the results over the last few quarters?","Jeffrey Woodbury","We always focus on cost management, our cost structure Doug. I\u2019d tell you that regardless of where we are in the business cycle, that is a fundamental part of our D&A is, how do we become even more efficient than we\u2019ve had historically? And that\u2019s not only through the highly qualified people we have working here at ExxonMobil but also the application, the technologies that we have in order to position ourselves in a, even a more effective manner to increase the value of those molecules.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, this is somewhat related to the cash flow question and discipline. What drives you to forward the 4Q buyback guidance at 3 billion, given the sequential commodity price drop or seasonality refining and that should do cash in 3Q and maybe in general what would commodity price do you need to slow the fly wheel or buyback or what the balance sheet, just kind of underwrite that through any potential downturn?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Evan, I would fall back on what I indicated previously on our capital allocation approach. It\u2019s a decision that we manage internally around, whether our cash requirements in order to invest in the opportunities that we have in our portfolio. Its making sure that we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the dividend. And then we make a unique decision internally around how much additional cash are we to go ahead and distribute to our shareholders \u2013 stock buyback program.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","At this moment it\u2019s a quarterly-by-quarterly assessments in those kind of an up and down overtime. Is that how it\u2019s approached?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah Evan I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably much more continual than that, but generally speaking there is, if you will, a decisive point on each quarter to decide what we\u2019re going to do in the next \u2013 near future.","Operator","And moving on we\u2019ll hear from Asit Sen, Cowen and Company.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks and good morning.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Asit.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","So two unrelated questions, first thanks for the color on U.S. onshore liquids, but wondering if you could quantify your production during the quarter if you could from U.S. and conventional.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, you bet Asit. Let me just share with you, the largest part of our unconventional U.S. liquids growth is in the Permian, Bakken and Woodford. And in total those are producing in excess of $210,000 barrels a day now. And as I said in my prepared comments it is, it has really been a significant progress over the last several quarters. I\u2019d give you a little more color to that by saying that about 40% of that is in the Bakken, 35% in the Permian and the rest is in the Woodford. Great progress, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the folks there at XTO and the success they\u2019ve had here in the recent past.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks, very helpful. And second on LNG, could you comment on how global LNG pricing adjust to lower oil prices in comparison. There is a four to six month lag, but I wonder if you could comment on that?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, I mean broadly speaking the specifics of our LNG commercial agreements are confidential, but let me use Papua New Guinea as an example a majority of the Papua New Guinea volumes are contracted in excess of 95%. They are linked to a crude price and as crude price varies, so does that LNG.","Operator","Thank you we\u2019ll now hear from Blake Fernandez, Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Good morning Jeff, thanks for taking the question. Over the past six months or so, you\u2019ve announced a couple of investments in the downstream in Europe, which seems a little bit countered to what we\u2019ve seen from peers. We\u2019re basically trying to reduce their capital employed in the area. And I\u2019m just curious if Exxon is maybe taking a different view on the macro longer-term. Or if it\u2019s a scenario where you feel you have superior assets where, over time maybe just capacity rationalization occurs. And you\u2019re last standing with an unattractive asset?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah. Blake thanks for the question and the interest in that area. Clearly we are stepping out and distinguishing ourselves, but let me step back just a little bit and talk about the European portfolio and then the downstream investments. I mean clearly Europe is disadvantaged by overcapacity. And some of which is driven by the lower cost feedstock in the U.S. and the Middle East. This sector will continue to rationalize existing capacity.","ExxonMobil\u2019s European assets though are advantage versus our peers due to the more efficient operations. And the integration that we have with our chemicals and lubricants manufacturing businesses. So you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in the business cycle in order to enhance our advantage position. Now specific to those investments, they are always focused around key areas like lowering our raw material costs, increasing our higher value product yields, expanding logistics capability and flexibility.","And then our main stay of reducing the operating cost structure. Ultimately to high grade the products to capture market demand. So if I focus specifically by way of example on the investment in the Antwerp delayed coker, that\u2019s around investing in conversion capacity to take lower product, lower yield product, such as the fuel oil and convert it to disciplined advantage where we have higher volume and more margins.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Thanks. I\u2019ll take one more if I could, you may not be able to answer this, but you mentioned the discovery in the Kara Sea which University-1. If I\u2019m not mistaken I\u2019ve read some press article suggesting that Rosneft may decide to pursue the additional drilling on their own due to the sanctions and what not. I\u2019m just kind of curious how that would unfold with regard to your relationship there. And participating in future interests?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Right, well Blake thanks for the interest. Clearly this is an important area for the industry in total. And we certainly appreciate the interest. Let me first start off by just recognizing the success of the well, I mean we\u2019re extremely proud of what the organization has achieved in an extraordinarily remote arctic region, both from a logistics and a drilling perspective. The team successfully completed the well with the utmost concern for safety and the environment. And that really does speak to the strength and capability of the organization.","As I said in my prepared comments, I can confirm that we encountered hydrocarbons, but this is a very large area. This acreage is over 31 million acres. We\u2019ve got one penetration in that, so it is premature to make any assessment or really say anymore at this point. We are currently evaluating results to assess the Woodford plants, we\u2019ll move forward on. I will remind you that ExxonMobil has a very longstanding and successful business in Russia, built on an affective and mutual beneficial relationship with the Russian partners.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Jason Gammel, Jefferies.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks very much. Two questions for me Jeff. The first on the accelerated drilling onto North America, I know that Exxon is a company that will invest throughout the pricing cycle, but I was just wondering if the number of rigs that are being employed in this place is going to be affected by the change that we\u2019ve seen in pricing conditions just over the last several weeks. Essentially what level of onshore price would you need to see before you can perhaps start laying down rigs?","And then the second question, one of your primary competitors, just this week, successfully IPO\u2019ed \u2013 MLP with pipeline assets. And there\u2019s evidently a pretty big value gap between what the stock market is willing to pay for those assets through MLP and an integrated oil stock. Have you considered any form of MLP type of transaction with your pipeline assets?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, Jason thanks for those questions. Let me first start with the unconventional, as I said really good progress, I gave a lot of details about it, very proud of what the XTO organization is achieving up there. Let me say that, these near-term price fluctuations are not going to have an impact on our operational activities. We test all of our investments across a range of economic parameters including price. And I\u2019ll just say at a high level that our current drilling programs and inventory are fairly robust in this price environment.","So we\u2019re very confident with the drilling activity as I indicated, we are picking up rigs, so that we can continue to progress our resource development activities. And it is a very significant part of our growth opportunity and importantly our improvement in overall profitability.","More specifically on the master limited partnership question. I talked a little bit already about our asset management program that is a fundamental aspect of how we do our business. And it\u2019s around making sure that we\u2019re making the right choices there that are maximizing value for the shareholder. We have, through the course of that process; we have really divested or monetized all of our non-strategic assets. So we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work you\u2019re hearing some folks do today.","The remaining assets that we\u2019ve got in place are very strategic to the integrated model that we have between the upstream, downstream or on chemical business. The MLPs are generally used as a financing mechanism to raise cash and fund business growth, as you know with our financial flexibility we have very low cost to capital. While I will never say no, I would tell you that just the cost benefit tradeoffs for MLPs running attractive for us given our low cost to capital.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Very helpful. Thanks Jeff.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roger Read. Wells Fargo.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi good morning.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Roger.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Just maybe going along with that sort of capital allocation and other questions that have come on here. So CapEx plus or minus 37 billion, or maybe I should say minus 37 billion here going forward. You just made the comment, a lot of the non-strategic assets have impaired. If we do find ourselves in a, let\u2019s say $80 to $85 oil environment, between the share repurchase program at around 3 million a quarter, the CapEx at 37 billion. And maybe not as many assets left to sell, at least from a non-strategic or non-core standpoint. How do you balance all of that, what gives, is it CapEx that gets pulled back, is it the share repurchase or is the \u2013?","Jeffrey Woodbury","And I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this thinking that there won\u2019t be any other divestment opportunities, because it is a continual process. Think of it as an ongoing upgrade of our overall portfolio whereby we continue organic exploration, identify higher up value assets, we continue to high-grade our down streaming chemical facilities. So it\u2019s an ongoing process that will likely continue to yield periodically divestment opportunities,","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay thanks, and taking another look at your lower 48 unconventional opportunities and ranking those in terms of returns or growth plus returns to some of your other opportunities, how do they scale up, or maybe as you just said, what is your best return opportunity today and where they fit in relative to that?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, I would tell you Roger that they all are very strong. There\u2019s a lot of variability even within a given resource area depending on where you are in the trend. And I would tell you that ExxonMobil has prime acreage in all three of the areas that I talked about, as well as some others. So we are very well positioned, and as you saw with the Permian basin, we continue to look for opportunities to high-grade the overall portfolio on those basins, so very strong inventory that we continue to high-grade and look for opportunities for progressing the investment opportunities in each one of those fields. So we would not expect any change in our operational plans, thank you Roger.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Allen Good, Morningstar Investment Research.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research","Good morning, just another follow-up question on the lower 48 unconventional, as you mentioned you\u2019ve been pretty active in Permian acquisitions. I just wonder what\u2019s Exxon\u2019s thought, as far as what\u2019s the right size Permian position that you eventually want to get to, to get that to scale. And is there a preference for Permian acquisitions to relative to Woodford and Bakken or is it just been a case of value?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah Allen, it\u2019s always a case of value for us. I wouldn\u2019t say that we are excluding any opportunity in the US or internationally. Now we have found a number of opportunities to high-grade the portfolio in the Permian recently, but we continue to keep very well alert to other opportunities that may come up. And maybe even with the current decrease in prices, we may have additional opportunities that we\u2019ll find they are complementary to our business and can increase our overall underlying value. And I would take that \u2013 I\u2019d extend that beyond the U.S., we\u2019ve leveraged the expertise within the U.S. unconventionals to position ourselves strategically for other unconventional opportunities globally.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research","Great, thanks. And just one on the downstream, Exxon obviously has a very large downstream global footprint, can you give us any color on what you\u2019re seeing as far as the demand side, given the slide we\u2019ve seen in oil prices. And a lot of concern out there is, I\u2019m not saying on the supply side, but weak demand. I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the demand patterns of late, given the lower prices.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, well I mean as I said in the presentation, we did some margin improvement, but generally demand has been fairly strong within the U.S., particularly in our chemical\u2019s business. But in Europe, Asia Pacific, demand has been down and that\u2019s really a function of building capacity faster than demand, as well as economic weakness. But you\u2019ve got to step back from a chemical\u2019s perspective, for instance, we\u2019re expecting demand to grow at 1.5% above GDP. And we\u2019re a long-term business where we invest for the long-term and it\u2019s all fundamental to energy outlook, and demand projections.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng, Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey Jeff, good morning.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Well first, just want to add my welcome to the Investor Relations.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Several quick questions, on the page 11 of your presentation, the other is a negative $1.1 billion comparing to the second quarter. In the second quarter there\u2019s about $1.6 billion of the other sales gain related to the Hong Kong power. And your exploration expanse is lower, so then maybe adding another 100 million, 150 million in earning. So that\u2019s about $300 million to $400 million of other benefits. Can you help us with that in terms of what that benefit may be, the nature?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yes, so you\u2019re looking at, Paul, the sequential earnings reconciliation?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","That\u2019s correct.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, so as I said in the presentation, that was down about $1.1 billion and I would, at a high level, say that its asset management is down about 1.3. It\u2019s a net effect of the absence of Hong Kong power as well as other acquisition activities that occurred during that period, as well as, I think you appropriately pointed out, that other operational items were positive by about $160 million, due to lower OpEx primarily in exploration as well as some minor for ex-benefits.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","So you\u2019re saying that there was a swing is 1.3, so that means we have about 300 million or so, sales gained in this quarter?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Ian Reid, BMO.","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","Hi Jeff.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Good morning Ian, how are you?","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","Yeah, very good. Can I ask you a quick question about Papua New Guinea? Now you\u2019ve got the first part of the project, or at least phase 1, fully on-stream, what is your thinking about adding the third train, utilizing the additional gas which a joint venture has discovered in the region. And also, potentially processing third party gas or building another train to process third party gas. Can you just kind of outline Exxon\u2019s thinking about that?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Sure Ian, thanks for bringing up Papua New Guinea because it\u2019s another very successful accomplishment for the organization. I would tell you that everything is on the table, in terms of what we do there. Obviously, first and foremost, is that in terms of our priorities is to make sure that we are very comfortable, the operating structure, as I said, started up early.","We got up to peak production, is operating very, very well, the project team and operations organization has done a remarkable job there. You\u2019re aware that there\u2019s some \u2013 we maintain an active exploration program in Papua New Guinea. We have picked up some additional resource; there are some other exploration opportunities that we\u2019re considering.","And I would tell you that the next step would be to consider \u2013 and has been under review, the economic viability for incremental trends, here at the LNG plant. It was designed in order to easily tie in additional trends, so we\u2019re very well positioned. And as you can appreciate, the incremental cost expand the PNG facilities is going to be much, much more competitive than other Greenfield site.","So in summary I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very pleased with the resource, the overall potential and performance of Papua New Guinea. We\u2019ve got some additional resource out there with the successful P\u2019nyang discovery. And we\u2019re looking for opportunities to add to it, and that can come, either through additional resource development or, as you indicated, processing third party gas.","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","Okay, thanks. And just one further thing, on the Russian sanctions, how is that affecting your Sakhalin developments, and also the LNG project which you\u2019re progressing with \u2013?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, very good. I feel to mention that when we were talking \u2013","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","[indiscernible] loss of PSE volume as result of rising oil prices can you provide some sensitivity on earned up there and how much production you get back if oil stays around $85?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Well Jason, I don\u2019t have the specific numbers at the price that you stated but I would tell you that sequentially in our sequential earnings that there were some positive effects to, associated with PSE volumes. It was under 10,000 barrels per day, second quarter to third quarter.","Ian Reid \u2013 BMO","Got it ok that\u2019s all for me.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now hear from Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","A question you already touched on CapEx and CapEx outlook a few times during the call but if we take step back and look a number of your European peers, there\u2019s been kind of a clear trend and may be for a variety of reasons, clear message and strong efforts towards capital constraint deferral of certain projects and free cash flow going forward from that point of view? It\u2019s been a bit more muted here in the U.S. may be how, if there\u2019s been a shift in your approach to project economics and relative returns and profitability as you, like your go forward portfolio and the potential of the constrain more CapEx or prices impacts there whatsoever?","Jeffrey Woodbury","We always are our ends are set well in advance as I said earlier our investment, full range of economic parameters including price so that we have the comfort, that we\u2019re going to end up regardless of the type of price fluctuations that we feel like the program is robust. Or any great business model is that we invest into these business cycles and we\u2019ve got the financial projects if we need some additional capital.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Specifically on Tanzania you guys have discovered enough lot of gas to date can you give us any thoughts in terms of timing, in terms of your expectations and go forward plans there?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah. So on Tanzania a very good progress between Statoil and ExxonMobil as I said certain gas discoveries, now over 21 TCF in place. There is a consortium that has come together they have evaluated potential sites for common onshore LNG facility and we have made plans on site location. Studies are progressing to determine the development it really is in really early stages and it\u2019s really too early to determine a specific startup date. Overall design capacity or even the capital investment, but fundamental for us environment is to ensure that an investment of this scale and complexity is to generate an acceptable return for our shareholders.","Operator","And our next question will come from Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Good Morning, just to confirm me to \u2013 on this CapEx question we keep coming back to is an interesting number again to be clear about peak of CapEx in 2013. And then you said next year\u2019s interesting variation in your spending for example even in the latest quarter we had downstream in chemicals. And beyond that, beyond the 37 net CapEx in the longer term future given that you\u2019ve highlighted to the extent to which you reached to peak in 2013 as a function of recapitalizing the upstream?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Right Paul, so as I said we grew up $42.5 million in 2013 and again I want to make the point that the resource opportunities that we had before us and the maturity of those and the confidence that we had that we would generate very favorable returns for our shareholders likewise it is a conscious decision to bring our upstream spending down to a normal spend pattern.","And as we communicated in early this year in our Analyst meeting we were projecting not to pull down to just south of $37 billion over the 2015 to 2017 period. And yes there is this larger increase in the downstream and chemical business and that is focused on like I talked upon Antwerp focused on making strategic investments that are going to better advantage our downstream facilities, relative to industry such as the North America ethane cracker at Baytown.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Level of CapEx, what do you mean by that? How do you define that normal level?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Well if look at the resources going forward Paul it\u2019s based on our judgment when those resources are going to be ready whether it be the definition of the resource, the definition of the development concept the regulatory or when we believe they are ready to move forward and we have an optimal development, that\u2019s really what I mean by normal looking at our portfolio as opposed to when we saw these really large projects that came to provision together that \u2013","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","And just coming back to the PSE question obviously if prices were to stay here you spoke about two Q3 obviously it is relatively minor oil price shift, at the moment you are guiding to $4.1 million barrels a day next year. I assume that you\u2019re continuing with the guidance like that in the Analyst meeting but the obvious expectation be that, that number would come in higher as a result of lower oil prices even though I know, there\u2019s a different coalition around economics but broadly speaking that would be what we should work towards, right?","Jeffrey Woodbury","I think Paul I would \u2013 in March at the Analyst meeting. Again we look at the range over a period of time it\u2019s going to drive what the prices do and we make our best judgment as to where we\u2019re going to fit in that in order to give you that guidance. So if you think about what we said back in Analyst meeting we said that we would grow from about $4 million barrels a day up to $4.3 million barrels a day.","1 million oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2017. And doing so we are adding up the and I\u2019ll mind you that a large part of that 95% plus was liquids and liquids linked gas production. So it will change our production mix by about 64% liquids and liquids linked to just south of 70% in 2017. So in summary I\u2019d say our guidance on volumes is still consistent with what we shared with you in March. Thank You Paul.","Operator","Moving on we will hear from Alastair Syme, Citi.","Alastair Syme \u2013 Citi","Hi Jeff couple of very good questions, can you maybe highlight little bit about how much you\u2019re spending on the U.S. shale piece is that something you\u2019d be willing to \u2013 and secondly just picking up on the comment you made about Qatar","Jeffrey Woodbury","[indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin, Societe Generale.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah, thank you. Most of the things been asked Jeff, but regarding the shale economic thresholds in North America with the Bakken, it sounded like you have a different kind of completion, it\u2019s not plug and perf, its somewhat different. Can you elaborate a little bit more, and also with that completion are you also doing similar thing in Argentina?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, good question John. I would tell you that, as I said in my comments, the XTO expertise that we built up in the unconventionals is being leveraged globally. And we are continuing to grow our capability there. As I shared in my prepared comments the improvements that we\u2019ve seen, not only in reducing overall cost, but improving the productivity of, if you will, the manufacturing process of drilling these wells. But a key element of that has been the application of technology. And as I said in my prepared comments, one of the benefits that we\u2019ve used in Bakken has been this completion technology, which is proprietary ExxonMobil technology called the XFrac.","And that allows us to avoid putting a whole bunch of plugs in the well and makes it a much more efficient and safer operation for completion installation. And to close on your question about Argentina, I\u2019d broaden that and say that, that all of these learning\u2019s and they\u2019re conventional to apply elsewhere within our portfolio. And once again its, it\u2019s just another leading performance in our capability, and that positions us very well to compete for resources.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you John.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Guy Baber, Simmons & Company.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones for me, first question around exploration, but generally speaking, can you just remind me what percentage of the total capital budget this year is allocated to exploration appraisal activity. And then optimally, where would you like to see that percentage longer-term, just to sustain the long-term opportunities that reserve maturation, but also how comfortable you maybe in flexing that down at any point in the cycle for any given year.","So that\u2019s number one, just thoughts on the exploration budget. And then secondly, just if you could quickly talk about the balance sheet, but you mentioned your excess financial markets if need be and your net debt to total cap obviously low compared to most peers. But actually high, relative to where it\u2019s been at the last 10 year period. But could you just remind us of your target leverage ratios and framework also. And just where you\u2019re comfortable in taking the leverage?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah. Guy let me first with the second, after your first question about whether we would flex down our exploration. I would tell you that we are opportunity driven, we got \u2013 in the well, we\u2019ve got a very robust inventory. It\u2019s a \u2013 we\u2019re very well positioned to compete, as I said earlier, it\u2019s all around how do you upgrade the value of overall resource base. So from an expert, we have really got to be focused on the horizon around high grading our portfolio, specific to our budget, we don\u2019t break that type of information out in terms of risk. Components within the exploration budget, but I\u2019d like you to think about our exploration activity as a means to further high grade our overall portfolio.","On the second point on our leverage ratio, there is no target. We\u2019ve been fairly consistent over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve maintained the triple A credit rating. I want you all to think about it, our focus is around value. It\u2019s not always \u2013 or not a focus around market share or volume, it\u2019s around value, how can we create greater value? And we\u2019ll use that balance sheet to achieve that objective when we think it\u2019s appropriate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Hey thanks very much. Just one more for me on Russia if I may, you touched on the policy sanctions related uncertainty on relation to the Archadeck. Are there any other uppered or reduced because of the sanction rules?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Yeah, so you may recall a number of joint ventures throughout Russia, we talked about the Kara Sea. We also have a venture in the Black Sea and West Siberia, and then lastly, a number of ventures within the Russian arctic ship. And if you think about the sanctions, they deal with specifically deepwater, unconventional resources and arctic activity. So , the joint ventures I just summarized for you, are included within the scope of the sanctions.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","So have all the activities in those JV\u2019s been suspended as a result?","Jeffrey Woodbury","Well we have \u2013 we are fully complying with the sanctions and regulatory requirements.","Operator","And we do have one follow-up question from Paul Cheng, Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey Jeff \u2013 we need to know your investment in Europe refining. Do you have any plan to do a safe system? Second question, I think in your comments you were saying that you have a spec in the quarter, and also at the end of the third quarter from the inventory underneath or overneath. Thank you.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Thank you Paul. On your first question around investments, I would just say broadly that we regularly evaluate our global portfolio where we have offered investment. As I\u2019ve already discussed, with areas targeting on things like expanding our feed logistics or reducing our cost structure. We have a lot of \u2013 and generally speaking Paul as a matter of practice we just don\u2019t want to comment or speculate on any particular opportunities or investments, maybe not be considering. When they\u2019re ready we will and we\u2019ve made a decision. We\u2019ll go ahead and ensure that more broadly.","The second question was around over lift. And I\u2019ll just, if I can, I\u2019ll refer back to our quarter-on-quarter upstream earnings reconciliation. And if you remember there was a volume mix component about the positive $340 million. And first and foremost there was a fairly sizeable component associated with project, high margin project and program activity of over $500 million. And as I said during my prepared comments, it really highlights the progress that we\u2019re making on our unit profitability in the higher value volumes.","Not for the sake of growing volumes, but for the sake of capturing value. There was an over lift component that was positive. And then there was an offsetting decrease in a number of various, such as entitlements, decline, downtime and some asset management.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr., Woodbury at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey Woodbury","Well to conclude, thank you all for your time and your interest this morning. Certainly, very good questions and I do look forward to further dialogue with you all in the near future, thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you all for your participation."],"8375":["ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2015  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Woodbury - VP, IR and Secretary","Analysts","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Asit Sen - Cowen and Company","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Allen Good - Morningstar","Ian Reid - BMO","Alastair Syme - Citi","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. As you know the focus of this call is ExxonMobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2014. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site.","Before we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our fourth quarter and full year performance. ExxonMobil delivered earnings of $32.5 billion in 2014 and fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion. These results highlight the value of ExxonMobil\u2019s integrated business model which enables us to produce solid financial performance throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of over $49 billion in 2014 and free cash flow of $18 billion, an increase of over $7 billion from 2013. We completed a record of eight major upstream projects during the year and achieved our full year plan to produce 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day.","Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results, global economic growth moderated in the fourth quarter, expansion in the U.S. continued but growth slowed relative to the third quarter, China\u2019s economy decelerated, while Europe and Japan showed continued signs of economic weakness. As you know, energy prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter and U.S. refining margins decreased significantly, while chemical specialty product margins improved on lower feed and energy costs.","Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 5, ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $6.6 billion or $1.56 per share. Corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter, through dividends and share purchase to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx was $10.5 billion in the fourth quarter, whereas cash flow from operations and asset sales were 7.7 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.7 billion and debt was $29.1 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $5 billion to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program yielded $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $9.1 billion, and shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion, debt in other financing increased cash by $7 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015.","Moving now to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion were $1.8 billion lower than the year ago quarter. Lower earnings in the upstream and downstream and higher corporate expenses were partly offset by higher chemical earnings. Results were favorably impacted by approximately $1 billion of non-cash effects, that included U.S. deferred income tax items and the recognition of the 2012 award, by the International Chamber of Commerce for expropriated Venezuela assets.","And the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $1.5 billion, primarily as a result of lower upstream and downstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9, upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $5.5 billion, down 1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion as worldwide crude oil prices declined almost $32 per barrel. Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $400 million, driven by a higher margin production growth from the U.S. and major projects in Canada, Angola and Papua New Guinea. All other items, increased earnings by a net $640 million, including adjustments to deferred income tax balances and recognition of the gain from the Venezuela ICC award received in 2012. The ICC award was recognized, given the favorable fourth quarter ruling of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.","Moving to Slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil equivalent production decreased by 0.7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids production was up, 80,000 barrels per day, driven by major new projects and work programs. However, natural gas production was down over 650 million cubic feet per day, as reduced entitlement volumes, lower weather-related demand primarily in Europe and field decline were probably offset by major projects in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia. In short, our volumes performance continues to demonstrate the progress being made to high-grade the portfolio mix with higher margin production.","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings decreased $948 million versus the third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion, driven by sharply lower worldwide crude prices, which declined over $27 per barrel. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $140 million, reflecting higher margin volume growth. All other items had a positive impact of $1.1 billion, including the previously mentioned deferred tax items and Venezuela ICC award. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were just over $15, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes and is down due to lower crude prices.","Moving to Slide 12, volumes were up $223,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 5.8% sequentially. Liquids production increased 117,000 barrels per day from higher entitlement volumes, improved facility uptime and work programs. Natural gas production was also up 639 million cubic feet per day, driven by a higher seasonal demand primarily in Europe.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $497 million, down 419 million from a year ago, earnings increased $40 million due to stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, mostly offset by weaker U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million and all other items decreased earnings by $480 million, primarily from higher maintenance activities and unfavorable tax effects.","Turning to Slide 14, sequentially fourth quarter downstream earnings decreased $527 million, lower U.S. refining margins, partly offset by stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, decreased earnings by $360 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by a further $20 million and all other items reduced earnings by $150 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities, partly offset by foreign exchange, favorable foreign exchange and other effects.","Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 15, fourth quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, up 317 million versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher non-U.S. product margins on lower feed costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million and all other items primarily unfavorable foreign exchange effects reduced earnings by $110 million.","Moving to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings were essentially flat as stronger specialty product margins were offset by volume and mix effects and increased maintenance activities.","Now I\u2019d like to provide a summary of our full year results shown on Slide 17. 2014 earnings were $32.5 billion or $7.60 per share. Corporation distributed $23.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to reduce share outstanding. Of that total $12 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx in 2014 was $38.5 billion which is down $4 billion from 2013 and is also down $1.3 billion from our 2014 guidance. Cash flow from operations and asset sales remain strong at over $49 billion, which included $4 billion from asset sales.","Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 18, during the year cash decreased from $4.9 billion to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing assets management program yielded $49.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $31.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $5.4 billion to fund our commitments, including working capital requirements.","Moving on to Slide 19 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2014 earnings were essentially flat with 2013 results. Higher upstream and chemical earnings were offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate expenses.","Turing now to the full year comparison of upstream results starting on Slide 20, upstream earnings of $27.5 billion were up $707 million from 2013. Realizations reduced earnings by $2 billion as crude oil prices declined almost $11 per barrel. Importantly favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by over $500 million reflecting investments and higher margin assets and our continued focus on profitability. Volume contributions from major project startups in U.S. onshore liquid plays partly offset by lower weather-related downtime and unfavorable entitlement impacts. All other items primarily asset sales and deferred tax effects increased earnings by $2.2 billion. Upstream after tax earnings per barrel, for the year was $19.47, up a $1.44 from 2013 despite declining crude prices.","Moving to Slide 21, as indicated volumes ended the year on plan at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, excluding impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry volumes were down by 1.7% or 71,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day from 2013 reflecting lower gas demand in Europe and asset sales. Of note, liquids production was up 44,000 barrels per day or 2%. Volume growth from work programs and major projects in Canada, Angola and Papua New Guinea were partly offset by field decline and divestment impacts. Our natural gas production was down 691 million cubic feet per day, driven by lower weather-related demand, entitlement and divestment impacts and field decline, partly offset by major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia.","The full year comparison for downstream is shown on Slide 22. 2014 earnings were over $3 billion down 404 million from 2013. Lower refining margins reduced earnings by $230 million, volume and mix effects mainly driven by refinery optimization activities increased earnings by $480 million. All other items primarily unfavorable, foreign exchange and tax impacts decreased earnings by $650 million.","On Slide 23, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2014 earnings of $4.3 billion increased $487 million from last year. Higher commodity product margins partly offset by lower specialty margins increased earnings by $520 million. Positive volume and mix effects on higher demand were offset by all other items driven by increased maintenance activities.","Moving now to an update on our cash flow growth shown on Slide 24, as mentioned annual cash flow from operations and asset sales was $49.2 billion while net investments in the business totaled $31.2 billion. Resulting free cash flow of 18 billion increased 7.3 billion compared to last year and supported total shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion. Debt and other financing along with a reduction in our cash balance provided additional funds to meet our commitments.","Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 25. Over the past year, ExxonMobil completed a record eight major projects, demonstrating a world-class project execution capabilities. We added more than 250,000 barrels per day of net capacity across a broad range of resource types and geographies. The higher margin production from these projects underscores our focus on delivering profitable growth.","We completed several projects over the last quarter. In Russia at offshore Sakhalin the first well at Arkutun-Dagi field reached target depth in December with first production in early January. The early gross production from the field is expected to reach 90,000 barrels and will bring total gross production at Sakhalin-1 to more than 200,000 barrels per day. Arkutun-Dagi is the last of three fields to be developed by the Sakhalin project, the other two fields Chayvo and Odoptu began production in 2005 and 2010 respectively.","In Canada, initial steam generation at the Cold Lake, Nabiye development started late December, followed by injection into the reservoir in early January. After steam soaking, the first bitumen production is expected later this quarter. Production will increase over the balance of the year with gross rates expected to reach 40,000 barrels per day. Nabiye is an expansion of existing Cold Lake field which started up in 1985 and produced almost 150,000 barrels per day in 2014.","In the greater Hadrian area of the Gulf of Mexico the Lucius project was essentially completed in December with first production in January. Gross production from Lucius is expected to be around 80,000 barrels of oil and 150 million cubic feet of natural gas per day once the wells have fully ramped up. The Hadrian South subsea production system of flow lines were installed and connected to the Lucius far host in late 2014 and will be brought online once Lucius production is stabilized. Hadrian South is ExxonMobil\u2019s deepest subsea tieback at more than 7,600 feet. The early gross production from Hadrian South is expected to reach approximately 300 million cubic feet of gas from two wells.","In offshore Abu Dhabi Upper Zakum is one of the world's largest oil fields with a resource estimate of 50 billion barrels. Together with our joint venture partners, we're progressing the field redevelopment to raise gross production capacity to 750,000 barrels per day. The joint venture is utilizing extended reach drilling from four new artificial islands and deploying proprietary ExxonMobil technology. Civil works are now essentially complete on all islands, drilling is ongoing from two of the islands and first production started in November of last year. Facility additions and drilling will continue over the next three years to reach the targeted production plateau.","And finally the Kearl expansion project in Canada continues to track ahead of schedule. Site construction activities are now largely complete and commissioning activities are ramping up. The project incorporates the learnings from the initial development phase and will double Kearl's production capacity to 220,000 barrels per day for the next several decades.","Turning now to Slide 26 for an update on our broad exploration program, drilling operations are ongoing at the Pelican South, wildcat well in the Neptune block offshore Romania. Following this well additional exploration targets in the area will be considered. In Argentina, we successfully drilled and tested two ExxonMobil operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta. The La Invernada X-3 well flowed at an average rate of over 600 oil equivalent barrels per day and is currently on a long-term test. It is among the best producing wells in the Vaca Muerta. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing in 2015.","Recently, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse exploration portfolio. ExxonMobil expanded its presence in the Canadian North Atlantic by 1.6 million gross acres, capturing three blocks, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. These blocks are in a proven oil-equivalent hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. This new opportunity will build on our 17 years of success with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron.","ExxonMobil also recently added significant acreage in West Africa, building upon a strong position that stretches for Iberia to Angola. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, we added 2.3 million gross acres, by successfully completing negotiations of production sharing contracts on two Deepwater Frontier blocks. These captures marked a return of ExxonMobil to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where we produced the country's first oil 30 years ago. In Equatorial Guinea, we've completed PSC negotiations to acquire an interest in another offshore block encompassing 160,000 gross acres. The PSC is subject to final government ratification. This additional acreage builds on almost 20 years of ExxonMobil operations in Equatorial Guinea. And in the UK North Sea, we were awarded a 50% working interest and two licenses. They are part of a proven hydrocarbon province in our producing fields. ExxonMobil and Shell, bid jointly for these licenses which cover more than 250,000 gross acres.","So in conclusion, our full year results underscore the value of our integrated business model. In 2014, ExxonMobil earned $32.5 billion and we achieved our full year plan to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. We maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach by selectively investing in attractive opportunities, thereby improving our production mix. Unit profitability increased from just over $18 per barrel in 2013 to about $19.50 per barrel in 2014 despite lower prices last year. Corporation generated free-cash flow of $18 billion an increase of over $7 billion when compared to 2013 and we maintained strong shareholder distributions totaling $23.6 billion. In summary, we delivered on our commitments and we remain resilient through the cycle.","Finally, I\u2019d like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February, we'll be releasing our 2014 reserve replacement data. And second as many of you may know, our upcoming Analyst Meeting will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 4th with a live webcast beginning at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. We will provide an update to our business strategies and our investment plans during the meeting. Presentation will be led by ExxonMobil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rex Tillerson.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","Jeff because the Company is so diverse and functioning geographically your commentary on global economic activity has always been pretty helpful and based on your remarks at the beginning, it seems like economic trends in the OECD and China, weakened materially during the second half and specifically in the fourth quarter so, my question is whether or not you have additional color or updates in those areas and also any commentary and\/or color on economic activity trends that you are seeing in the non-OECD as well?","Jeff Woodbury","I would say broadly speaking, I'll pull back on our overall assessment of what demand will be doing across the globe, particularly in Asia Pacific. We are forecasting that demand and of course as I've said previously, that demand assessment that we do on an annual basis, really underpins our business strategies and our investment plans. So, as we look forward, we see oil demand growing at about 0.8% per year, that's underpinned by transportation and chemical needs. In the gas sector, we see gas demand growing by about 1.5%-1.6% per year and that's primarily underpinned by power generation and industrial demands. Now overall demand growth is largely underpinned by the non-OECD growth so when you think about our business the scope of our business and how we lay out our business strategies and our investment plans they really are focused on the long-term expectation around energy demand.","Doug Terreson","And then also specific to the Company how much of the $1 billion non-cash effect was related to the arbitration ruling with Venezuela and also was this entire amount accounted for in the upstream?","Jeff Woodbury","So Doug on the nearly $1 billion about 70% of that was associated with the adjustments to our deferred tax accounting and then about 30% of that is associated with the Venezuela award and that was in the non-U.S. component of the upstream.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","So just to start off on the CapEx side last quarter Exxon indicated that it did not plan to cut its CapEx in 2015 versus its initial target. So I know you\u2019ve given a more broad update at the Analyst Day but just generally speaking has your view changed at all or are you still deciding at this stage and obviously you pulled a buyback lever there so just kind of wondering more broadly how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Jeff Woodbury","Sure Phil and I can certainly appreciate a lot of interest given this climate that we are in right now. I\u2019d tell you that right now we have no CapEx guidance but as you may recall we had signaled a further reduction in CapEx to under $37 billion in 2015 as we normally do we\u2019ll provide an update on our -- both our business strategy and our investment plans next month as I indicated. As you are aware we have been reducing our capital spend since 2013 due to several reasons including the completion of several major projects, our ongoing intense focus on capital efficiency and of course our disciplined investment planning given the economic parameters.","I guess Phil I\u2019d like to emphasize a couple of points recognizing that I am asking you to hold off until next month. First, regardless of where we are in our business cycle this organization has a very strong culture of driving down our cost structure, whether it be self help in our operating cost or capital efficiency in our project execution. We expect to lead the cost curve in capturing savings especially in downturns like we\u2019re experiencing today. Second, we challenge all of our investments to ensure that we are creating long-term shareholder value through the cycle and remember we are price takers, we don\u2019t assume price growth into the future, but we really focus on those things that we can control like cost, liability and of course our project execution.","So Phil we\u2019ll keep a close eye on our cash flow, maintain our investment discipline and of course our commitment to the growing dividend and where necessary we\u2019ll leverage our balance sheet to meet our commitments as appropriate.","Phil Gresh","And then a question on the buyback I mean obviously it could have been any number between 0 billion and 3 billion. But just wondering kind of why you specifically picked what you did? Are you trying to kind of target a certain leverage level assuming the strip or just how you\u2019re generally thinking about it and more specifically just kind of wondering what would make you change it up or down from here again?","Jeff Woodbury","Sure Phil. Obviously, it\u2019s a number of factors our share of buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. The buyback pace has been determined each quarter considering the Company\u2019s current financial position, our CapEx requirements, our dividend requirements, as well as our longer term business outlook and we\u2019ll continue to manage our business in a prudent manner throughout the cycle as we have said many times and that buyback decision will be really an outcome of our cash flow management. So, I\u2019d just again emphasize that we remain committed to our investment program and of course paying our growing dividend.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Jason Smith","Jeff it\u2019s actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Good morning. Just coming back to the one-time items in U.S. refining your earnings looked a little bit weaker than your peers that have reported so far you called out some year-over-year tax and maintenance impacts but it seems like that was not part of your 1 billion, could you maybe give some color around those and maybe quantify the absolute impact for the U.S. and I am just curious if there is anything else going on in U.S. refining beyond that?","Jeff Woodbury","Sure. Let me just give you a broad summary on the U.S. refining. Fourth quarter our downstream earnings were impacted by lower realized refining margins and a negative crude lag impact, as well as hard maintenance activities at some of our largest refineries in the Gulf Coast. While earnings were marginally negative over the quarter our full year results were solid at just over $1.5 billion despite the pressure on refining margins and a heavier maintenance year than normal. Overall our U.S. refining footprint is just very well positioned to benefit from advantage feed stocks and from the investments that we have made that focus across a number of areas to further advance our profitability in those assets, such as feedstock flexibility, logistics capability, increasing the higher value product yields and reducing our fundamental cost structure and most important capturing the most value from our integrated business model.","Jason Smith","And maybe just on PSC impacts, you\u2019ve gave some color on the sequential improvement I think it was 78,000 barrels a day positive and with oil down significantly from 4Q can you maybe just give any color around the incremental impact that that price is down?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, you can appreciate that each of our contracts are unique and associated with the commercial arrangement. It\u2019d be really tough to give you a rule of thumb because we do have in that category price impacts, you\u2019ve got spend impacts, we have temporary volume impacts that are associated with the fiscal agreements. Broadly speaking you\u2019re correct to assume that lower crude prices will provide an uplift as you saw in the sequential comparison but that impact is largely complicated by the multiple contracts, cost recovery and other effects that we have in our operations.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","My first question maybe CapEx from another angle, net debt is up $7 billion in the quarter I know you reduced the buyback guidance yet, I mean how willing are you to flex the balance sheet through a down cycle maybe discuss limitations on that side which would either take that lower to the buyback lower reduced CapEx? And maybe just lastly on CapEx, I presume you already have a 2015 CapEx number and it\u2019s more of a guidance question or just function how does that work? Thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Evan, so I\u2019d get you to think about it from a, it\u2019s fundamental in how manage our cash in the consideration and balance of all the variables that we need to address the inflows, our commitment to fund investment plans as well as our dividend -- I don\u2019t have any specific guidance for you and debt capacity or plans as you know our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding as evidenced by the reductions that we have taken in CapEx and as you have heard the reduction planned in the first quarter on share buybacks. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in our investment approach throughout the cycle but we won\u2019t forego any attractive opportunities. We have a significant debt capacity but we will maintain our financial flexibility and we will assess the cash and our funding options under arrange at outcomes and take a balanced approach to meet those obligations as I indicated. So in short I\u2019ll come back to this message throughout our discussion that we remain committed to investment program that delivers on attractive return but also to pay a reliable and growing dividend.","Evan Calio","And maybe second is part of the smaller issue just a question on the quarter, is there an asset sale loss and I missed that which would affect the lower tax rate for the quarter if you can talk me through that please?","Jeff Woodbury","So the lower tax rate that you\u2019re focusing on really have three components, one would be the gains on deferred tax items that I mentioned already. The second would be changes to the portfolio mix given the income streams that we get from our U.S. and non-U.S. And then third would be ongoing asset management activities. But I will tell you that Evan that our guidance of our effective tax rate is still consistent or about the mid 40%.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Sankey will Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Just could you update us on what\u2019s going on in Russia from your point of view, if anything and further to that which I know is a JV that was very important to your longer term result and production plan, can you talk about how you would define the attractive opportunities that you\u2019ve mentioned, I assume you\u2019re referring to M&A and whether you\u2019d be more attractive to oil I would assume as opposed to gas reserves more attractive maybe in the new world order to U.S. reserves and maybe within the U.S., if you could set us in a toll about what you would consider and how you would define an attractive opportunity? That would be great, thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Let me starting at Russia, broadly speaking, I mean there is really nothing new to report on that as you all know that sanctions are still in place and we will continue to fully comply. As we said previously that it does not apply to Sakhalin-1 which I\u2019ll just take this opportunity to say that we\u2019ve had extraordinary success really thanks to a very talented organization and a highly effected joint venture. We are very pleased with the successful start-up of our Kutendagi, but in terms of the rest of the business we just need to wait to see how the sanctions play out. I will remind you that ExxonMobil does have a very long standing and successful business in Russia that I\u2019d say is built on an effectively mutually beneficial relationship with our partners.","On the second item around attractive opportunities in M&A. Broadly speaking and we've talked previously about our asset management program and you would really think about it on for the full scope of how we have high-grade our portfolios through asset management and that maybe obviously have a ongoing component of divestments of non-strategic or lower value assets but also bringing in through acquisitions some new opportunities. And those maybe bolt on acquisitions, than may be new entries that are synergistic to our business. But Paul we stay very alert to value propositions, we're watchful where we can capture opportunities to high-grade our portfolio whether it be oil, whether it be gas, onshore, offshore. But I will be clear that the real focus here is creating value and we will pursue only those acquisitions that we think that have ultimate strategic value and are accretive to our longer-term returns.","Paul Sankey","Yes I guess within that you are primarily interested in long-term reserves, right? I mean obviously you don't want to buy someone's decline curve, so it becomes a question of 2P and 3P I assume?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So Paul if we focus on -- again if we can get synergistic benefits like some of the bolts ons that we have brought into XTO over the last couple of years have been very beneficial. But they do have a very significant component of development potential where we can apply our resource capability expertise and how to develop that, our proprietary technology and our strong balance sheet. But yes we don't want something that's already on decline that doesn't have potential we're really looking for something that really can upgrade our overall portfolio and add future potential.","Operator","We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","Just on I am trying to get a sense of again this CapEx question again. How much of your say upstream spends is kind of locked in for 2015 and how much wiggle room do you have in 2016 I appreciate this maybe something for the Analyst Day but just trying to get a sense of the levers that you could pull if your revenues are much lower this year?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, sure. I would tell you that as we look at our overall investment program, we've been -- we focus on every asset that we have got regardless of whether it's as you have indicated a longer-term investment which is quite frankly a core component of our investment program as well as the shorter cycle investments and study work, nothing is really sacred in there. But as I indicated we have very strong culture of driving those cost structures down, we have been very actively engaged with our service providers and we fully expect to capture savings in across the spectrum of our business from rig rates to labor and services as well as commodities. But I would be clear Ed that we're probably in the very early innings of this effort. There is a lot of strong reaction to the current price business climate and we think that with that it presents a number of really good opportunities to capture incremental savings, lower the overall cost structure of the business as well as position us with some other opportunities as we go forward. The thing that I would really point out that distinguishes us is that as we've said many times is that we can invest through the business cycle and it presents some opportunities that we will able to lower that cost structure and prove our overall longer-term returns given the financial capability that we have.","Ed Westlake","And then a quick quarter question. Asia natural gas production and Australasia as well down ticked in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter I appreciate there is lots of different demand drivers across a big business, but is there anything specific you would call out for that step down?","Jeff Woodbury","I would say that a component of that had to do with demand in Australia but remember that there was a very healthy increase associated with Papua New Guinea over the year sequentially you don't see as much of an increase there was a slight increase in Papua New Guinea though.","Ed Westlake","But in Asia there was well say a much larger business but that was also down generally?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, it was generally at some facility performance downtime.","Operator","We will take our next question from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez","The first question in terms of Venezuela I know you mentioned the arbitration ruling, can you just kind of confirm that that finalizes this process or is there any additional legs to kind of move forward on there?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Blake on Venezuela, there is actually two separate arbitration proceedings one was International Chamber of Commerce that I mentioned that we recognized the award on. The second was the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. What we recognized was the first one I will note that both of those decisions did confirm that the Venezuela government failed to provide fair compensation for the assets that were expropriated. We will recognize the second ruling at the time that we receive payment and when all legal proceedings have concluded.","Blake Fernandez","I hope this doesn't get too in the weeds but the second question is on the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. I am just curious if you could talk around how that's impacting your business with the rapid moves we've seen and may be what's then embedded in the quarter, as a result of FX?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, in terms of ForEx, as you are probably very aware that it has offset impacts across our business in the upstream, it primarily ends up being a margin benefit due to local denominated OpEx whereas in the chemical and downstream, it tends to have a negative impact due to our dollar denominated crude payables. So, in quarter-on-quarter it was a slight hurt to earnings of under $50 million although sequentially, it actually was a positive of over $200 million.","Operator","We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","I was wondering, if you could just go through Exxon's current thoughts on the global LNG market, you have several potential projects that haven\u2019t FID\u2019d yet, you think may be the global market needs to take a pause at this point?","Jeff Woodbury","Well Brad, again as we talked a little earlier, our investment plans are really founded on our outlook for supply and demand. We still, as I said projected gas demand to grow about 1.6% per year to now in 2014 and that really provides the business case for our LNG projects. Broadly speaking our existing LNG facilities are a key component of our portfolio, very important part of our margin generation. As we see demand grow in the future we expect supply will grow in line with that demand. Obviously these are capital-intensive projects so we'll need to ensure there is a sufficient price structure in place to underpin those investments. We have gotten a number of projects across the globe that are in place. They are positioned to go ahead and compete for that demand profile.","Brad Heffern","And just thinking about gas in a different way, certainly in the U.S. you've been somewhat minimizing gas drilling over the past couple of years and the market certainly has its own challenges right now but has the downturn in oil caused you to think any different way about, what's specifically your drilling for in the U.S.?","Jeff Woodbury","Not really, I would tell you that, it's still based on our demand projections we've got significant drillable gas potential within the U.S. and as you know this, generally a short cycle type investment. We can get on capacity pretty quick. So, we are very well positioned to do that, should the demand grow and the prices support it. I would also say that from a chemical perspective, our chemical business is very well positioned to take advantage of the lower commodity prices. Particularly in U.S. our manufacturing sites are highly flexible and can run across a wide range of feedstocks, from ethane all the way to gas oil.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel","Thank you. I actually got a follow-on to both the questions that were just asked, just in terms of how you are managing the lower 48 business in the pricing downturn Jeff, are you keeping a relatively steady rig count or have you being laying down rigs the way that the rest of the industry has as well.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, well that's a good question Jason. I\u2019d cast it from a -- if you will a historical perspective that, we've taken a very measured pace in how we've developed our lower 48 unconventional resources. You did see over 2014 a number of operators really ramp-up their rig counts significantly, we did grow our rig count and in fact, we are up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter but at a very measured pace to make sure that we didn't outrun our headlights. We wanted to makes sure that we had a good understanding of the resource performance and importantly, we wanted to make sure that we are fully integrating all the earnings back into our advanced program. So, we've been very measured, how we've moved forward going forward we'll consider all the factors, including the business condition, infrastructure capability as well as our demand projections. But going forward, we've got, I just want to reinforce that we do have a very robust inventory of opportunities even in this price environment.","Jason Gammel","And my second question is on the LNG business. Can you remind us how much just as a percentage of your overall LNG output is committed under long term contracts and how much is actually put into the spot market. And then on the spot market, are you seeing significant demand weakness that potentially would even lead to reducing sold utilization?","Jeff Woodbury","So on the LNG business, I'd say that a majority of our LNG or current LNG is under long term contracts, very few that have spot sales. Of course we did take some spot sales with Papua New Guinea, given the early startup. And also note that in our LNG contracts we have potential to divert cargos as well, which gives a lot of flexibility.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Asit Sen with Cowen and Company.","Asit Sen","Two unrelated questions. First on the issue of supply chain cost and your prior success with that. I was wondering if you could quantify annual third partly cause globally for the organization. Some of your peers have highlighted multibillion dollar opportunities for this reduction. And also any high level thoughts on recently announced oil service industry consolidation? Has anything changed on the ground for Exxon?","Jeff Woodbury","Broadly speaking -- I don\u2019t have specific numbers. As I said previously we are as a mainstay in how we manage our business. We\u2019re constantly working on that cost structure. We are very active with our service providers. As I indicated we\u2019re probably in the early innings of that. We\u2019ve seen -- we are seeing decreases in rig rates and labor and service costs as well as starting to see some commodity changes as well. But watch that space. More is to come in that area.","On the second question, remind me? I said, was there\u2026","Asit Sen","And on the oil service industry consolidation, any thoughts on that or things have changed?","Jeff Woodbury","No, there is really nothing I have to say on that. We access all the service providers and competition is good and we have a very strict standard on what we expect from in terms of quality, performance and service costs.","Asit Sen","And just my follow up is on U.S. onshore. Last quarter you had highlighted that Bakken was Exxon\u2019s most active and conventional play with I think 13 rigs running. Could you update us on activity levels currently, and perhaps provide update on Woodford and Permian as well?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, so across the three main liquid plays that we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re producing in excess of 220,000 barrels a day gross and we\u2019re running currently about 44 rigs. I\u2019d say we\u2019re active in all three of them. That rig count has if you compare back to what I said last quarter has increased but very-very encouraging list of opportunities and we\u2019re making great success in integrating our learnings and driving down the cost curve.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Two quick questions. I don\u2019t know whether you have any number you can share. In your prior calls when we\u2019re looking at the contract, is there a number you can share in terms of the send, maybe for the contract is over two years, still remaining? In other words I'm trying to understand that what is the percent of your supply cost that if we do see a substantial deflation in the industry cost structure, it's going to see a rapidly quick pass flow into you?","Jeff Woodbury","Paul, I don\u2019t think I have any guidance on that.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And secondly that -- you\u2019re saying that in the downstream you have a crude lag purchase. In fact that is negative?","Jeff Woodbury","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Cheng","Can you quantify how big is that?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, broadly speaking from a crude lag -- I want to be clear Paul. When we see a decrease in prices like we\u2019re seeing right now, we have a negative crude lag effect. In the fourth quarter absolute it was just over $600 million. And likewise in an environment where price is increasing you\u2019d have the opposite effect.","Paul Cheng","Do you think the -- nice [ph] oil economy, so why we have such a big negative crude effect? And also that I thought the price finalization were made to your Saudi contract in a declining oil price environment. So it\u2019d actually be a favorable positive impact. So I get that. I'm just totally wrong on that then?","Jeff Woodbury","So the crude lag effect is primarily associated with pipeline supply contracts standard terms to how the pricing is done.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Can you speak also -- this 600 primarily in U.S. then, I presume?","Jeff Woodbury","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Cheng","And that -- is there any other tax impact in the quarter other than say the $700 million U.S. deferred tax in the upstream?","Jeff Woodbury","Paul is your question relating to our overall performance or specific to a segment?","Paul Cheng","Yes, you can say looking at all the other segment that we know that you have $700 million of the U.S. tax benefit in the upstream. Is there any other tax negative impact or positive impact in the other segment?","Jeff Woodbury","That is an essence the most of it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good","Maybe if I could tackle the cost improvement question from a different angle. Is there any area that Exxon has identified based off trends of the past two years, where you think you may have more opportunity to cut cost relative to other areas. And I guess I'm thinking more along the lines of project type and in specific regions relative to the other ones?","Jeff Woodbury","I think broadly speaking -- we always feel like we\u2019ve got opportunity to become cost efficient. From a capital prospective, it\u2019s around upfront planning for execution, to make sure that we\u2019re most effective in utilization of services as well as commodities. In terms of our day to day operations, our fuel costs are big a component. You have to manage that appropriately. In terms of energy efficiency of your facilities. As I commented on the capital program, I\u2019d say that nothing is really sacred. We continue to identify additional opportunities to make our cost structure more efficient.","Allen Good","And then on asset sales, I would assume that you guys are more opportunistic on that level and I think you probably recall -- you said the approach of the -- if it's worth more to us or more to the buyer, we'll sell. And could you give me around your asset release interest that you may have you may have seen six months ago declined into today and should we expect maybe the asset sale slowdown over the next year to 18 months?","Jeff Woodbury","We\u2019ve got such diverse portfolio of assets, I really couldn\u2019t characterize for you whether time -- the interest is increased or decreased. Assets are so unique in their own right, and recognize that we're -- these are years of planning to assess when the right time is to go ahead and monetize that asset in a different means. We\u2019ve been very successful in capturing incremental value from our assets that we don\u2019t believe longer has a strategic fit for business. So I\u2019d leave at that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank","Ryan Todd","Maybe one follow-up question on U.S. liquids production. It was quite strong in the quarter -- strong sequentially and strong year-on-year. Can you talk a little bit about what assets are primarily driving that growth? Is this kind of your big three onshore plays that you are talking about or is it a little bit of everything?","Jeff Woodbury","So this is a good opportunity to really talk more about it. In terms of our fourth quarter versus the third quarter performance, we\u2019re up quite significantly on our volumes primarily driven by our projects. Quarter-on-quarter projects are up about 130,000 oil equivalents barrels per day. Those volumes are coming from Angola, primarily the Coak [ph] project, in Canada associated with the Kearl project in Papua New Guinea, associated with our LNG project. We had an increase in project volume associated with Malaysia to Loakim [ph] and Damar, as well as we had a very nice build in our U.S. work program due to our active drilling program in the three main liquid plays. The other thing I'd point out is that we've also made great progress. The team has done an outstanding job in reducing our downtime in our facilities. 2014 was a very successful year, and that brings very high value volume to the bottom line.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe one more LNG. I guess a couple of quotes on LNG which is -- is there any risk to the pricing in terms of your exiting LNG contracts in the current environment from periodic reopeners in the contracts? And would a longer duration of this moderate environment change the pace or effort at all around U.S. LNG exports?","Jeff Woodbury","No, again these are very large capital intensive projects. The investment is underpinned by our long term gas demand projection and that's really the business case. As I've said earlier our existing LNG projects are a very significant part of our margin generation.","Operator","We will take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Just maybe follow-up on a couple of things that have been hit here already. But as you look at the major projects that you outlined in the earlier presentation, just curious what the sort of incremental '15 impact is? A lot of these projects started at the end of '14 and roll into '15. If you could give us an idea of maybe the volumes impact there?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, so for our 2014 program, just to recap, we added about 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. As we look forward for 2015, we will need to provide you an update at the March Analyst Meeting.","Roger Read ","Well I guess I was just wondering for the ones that were highlighted in the presentation, or we just -- it's the March event, we'll wait for that I guess is?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, for 2015 -- I shared with you how those investments in the presentation will ramp up to their peak production. As I said Arkutun-Dagi ramping up to 90,000 barrels a day, Nabiye ramping up to 40,000 barrels a day, Hadrian South ramping up 3,00 million cubic feet per day. Beyond that we'll be more specific in next month's Analyst Presentation to have a discussion about it.","Roger Read","Okay. And then earlier in some of the Q&A, you had mentioned specific to dealing with the cost structure and it sounded like to me both internally and your third parties. Any comparisons contracts you can do with previous downturns in terms of contracts that you have fixed here? An another way of asking the question, any change in the flexibility Exxon has to address the cost structure today versus several years ago, or in prior downturns we've had?","Jeff Woodbury","No I wouldn't highlight anything that's changed. As I've said a couple of times, it's a very intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering our cost structure in our business across the areas that I talked about previously.","Roger Read","So no particulars on rig contracts or anything like that that, that are more onerous than prior times?","Jeff Woodbury","No. And I don't want to get into the specifics on our commercial arrangements, but we've got a very large sizable operation and that positions us well to go ahead and work with our providers to put in place a very effective cost structure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ian Reid with BMO. ","Ian Reid","Jeff, just got a question on your pre-sanctioned pre-FID projects. A couple of your partners have been talking about pushing these out due to carrying some cost pressures and waiting for lower service cost et cetera. Specifically thinking about projects such as Tangese and some of the Austrilasian and Canadian R&D projects, is that something which you're also kind of factoring into with your longer-term production and your CapEx outlook in terms of pushing these kind of more marginal projects down the road a little bit?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, it'd be a consideration. Broadly speaking we've got a very large and diverse inventory of opportunities. We are very careful as we move these things forward, that one, not only have they reached technical maturity, but that we have tested the economic viability across a full range of economic parameters, including commodity price. So while we don't forecast a -- or expect a price growth in order to make these investments go forward, we want to make sure that we go into this eyes wide open and that we have a good handle on how robust these investments are.","So when we do have these commodities -- volatilities like we're seeing right now, we're comfortable about the investment plans that we have in place. Quite frankly our investment program is really driven by a long-term projection and we just don't overreact to volatility in the market. But we're mindful. We're mindful about implications on the business climate, implications on our cash flow management and then the overall supply demand projection. So all of those variables are considered in how we set up our investment plans, but given that it's based on a long-term projection of demand, and they have been tested across a range of economic parameters, there won't be a whole lot of change. I'm not suggesting that there will be no change, but there won't be a whole lot of change to our investment plans.","Ian Reid","Okay, all right, that's understood. Can I just ask a quick question on chemicals? Your numbers there seem to be holding up pretty well. I'm just wondering what you are thinking about chemical demand, in particular outside of the U.S going forward, because you're going to be seeing very much lower in [indiscernible] prices now. So what do you feel about the kind of pricing and demand side of that business?","Jeff Woodbury","Very well positioned. It's a great business. We've got the chemical facilities positioned throughout in North America. We're benefiting from the lower feed costs. We've got advantaged assets there in the Europe and Asia Pacific, our steam crackers really benefit from the lower price environment we're in right now. Particularly our newest cracker in Singapore, which can process an unprecedented range of feedstocks, ranging from crude oil, including crude oil, which is the -- really an industry first.","Ian Reid","Yes, I am just wondering about how the industry dynamic you're seeing out there in terms of demand and pricing -- I know you're well positioned but what are you seeing in terms of Asian demand, European demand.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, Ian, our global demand is expected -- based on our assessment it's expected to grow above GDP, driven by Asia.","Operator","We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.","Alastair Syme","Can you just come back to the deferred tax benefits and just explain what's going on? A comment please?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes so, we periodically will review our deferred tax accounts to make sure that we've got the right reserves in place, and sometimes that results in an adjustments which you're seeing this quarter.","Alastair Syme","It's not related to commodity prices in anyway?","Jeff Woodbury","No, it's just a prudent review of our deferred tax accounts.","Alastair Syme","Okay. And my second question -- some people have eluded to that -- this is the lag effect on pricing. If could just discuss on LNG, what the typical lag effect is and how -- when do you think we'll see bottom prices, given where oil prices are today?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, there is a crude lag effect on our LNG contracts. We're going to discuss the specifics of those. So you will see some impacts going forward. It really does vary by contract.","Alastair Syme","Okay, but it's sometime the first and second quarter, will be reasonable even?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, it depends on what prices do.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","First on the balance sheet, is it still the case that you are targeting maintaining AAA credit rating? And if so, how much debt do you think you can take on and still keep the AAA?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes so as I said earlier Paul, we don't have any specific guidance on debt capacity or our plans. We will asses our cash and funding options around a range of outcomes and we'll take a balanced approach to meet our obligations. But as I indicated, we have significant debt capacity, but importantly we'll maintain our financial flexibility.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. In relation to your top three U.S. liquids play, if you said that the rig count has actually increased from three months ago, can you name any geographic areas, either North America or otherwise, where the rig count has dropped in the last three months?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I'd just say broadly speaking at the level that we'll share with you all, our overall rig count globally is running just under 100 rigs. About 60% of that is in the U.S. and we continue to assess the value proposition of maintaining a rig activity. I'll leave it at that there.","Operator","We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.","Guy Baber","You highlighted the improvement to your underlying upstream margins through 2014 despite a lower year-on-year commodity pricing environment, which you all have been very focused on for some time and I think was a very important accomplishment for you guys. Setting aside the commodity -- as we look to 2015, I was just hoping you could comment on just bigger picture expectations for the trend in underlying upstream margins and what do you think perhaps the biggest drivers and biggest opportunities may be. And I'm thinking evolution of maybe project mix and ramp ups, costs, or focused portfolio moves, just wondering if there is anything specific you could share there that we should be focusing on? And then I had a quick follow up.","Jeff Woodbury","Good question Guy. I'd say I appreciate the recognition of the progress that we've made over 2014. And I'd say that, that's a result of several factors. One is this intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering our cost structure too has been the higher margin production that we've been adding to the portfolio due to our major project activity and our U.S. onshore drilling activity, predominantly in the three main liquid plays that we've talked. Both have been a significant uptick to our overall unit profitability.","Guy Baber","That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow up was with 2014 now on the books, I was just wondering if there is any update you could share on base portfolio decline, how that performed versus expectations? And then big picture, did Exxon expect an increase in global decline rates just for the industry, given some base spending that\u2019s perhaps being cut? And then is that an important component of your oil price, kind of fundamental outlook?","Jeff Woodbury","So our overall base decline in 2014 was about 3%. We have continued to offset that with our work program activity as well as the major project adds. Obviously in our unconventional you see a higher decline rate earlier on and then it flattens out and that will have an impact and we offset that with a very active work program.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Paul Cheung with Barclays.","Paul Cheung","Just two very quick follow up. Do you have underlip or overlip in the quarter for your upstream production versus the sales versus the production?","Jeff Woodbury","So the overlipped and underlipped we have a -- my recollection was that we did have an underlip in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.","Paul Cheung","How about that versus the actual production?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, that\u2019s what it is. Underlip versus the production.","Paul Cheung","Do you have -- can you quantify what is that number?","Jeff Woodbury","Sequentially it was about 90,000 barrels.","Paul Cheung","Okay, and\u2026","Jeff Woodbury","Paul, I'd just highlight though, while we see that variability on a quarter to quarter basis, I\u2019ll just note that it was essentially flat year-on-year.","Paul Cheung","And that do you have -- and I think that -- very little asset sales. Just wondering is there any asset sales gain in the quarter?","Jeff Woodbury","For the quarter on the asset sales, it was very small, Paul. It had some small upstream assets in the fourth quarter and very small downstream as well.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time.","Jeff Woodbury","To conclude, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for your time and your questions this morning. As you know our business model is designed to be successful in a business climate known for commodity price volatility, and that\u2019s really why it always comes back to the fundamentals. Prudent cash management, operational reliability and efficiency, there's intense cost control. I talked about it a couple of times and obviously excellence in project execution. And we really do look forward to sharing more with you in March with an update on our business strategies and our investment plans. So until then everybody take care and we\u2019ll see you in March. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8372":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","","David Rosenthal \u2013 VP, IR and Secretary","Analysts","","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David Rosenthal","Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.","Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, with mixed performance across the regions. The U.S. economy grew moderately despite the adverse effects of severe winter weather conditions. China\u2019s growth rate has flattened while the economies of Europe and Japan improved modestly. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased narrowing the discount to Brent as the global marker decreased in the quarter. Western Canadian select prices increased significantly. North America natural gas prices were also significantly higher. Global industry refining margins were essentially flat while chemical commodity product margins were stronger during the quarter.","Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings were $9.1 billion or $2.10 per share. The corporation distributed $5.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion in the quarter. CapEx was $8.4 billion. Cash flow from operation and asset sale was $16.2 billion including proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.8 billion and debt was $21.4 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash increased by $900 million from $4.9 billion to $5.8 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $16.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.3 billion including a reduction in debt of just over $1 billion. Yesterday the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per share a 9.5% increase from last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the second quarter of 2014.","Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings of $9.1 billion decreased by $400 million from the first quarter of 2013. Lower downstream chemical earnings as well as higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher upstream earnings.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 7 earnings increased by $750 million as higher upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 8. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of $746 million versus the first quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $410 million primarily driven by higher U.S natural gas realizations.","On a worldwide basis natural gas realizations increased $0.31 per 1,000 cubic feet while crude oil realizations decreased by $4.09 per barrel. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by a net $20 million. This included a favorable liquids mix effect of about $300 million reflecting increased volumes in Canada, Russia and West Africa as well as the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. A positive liquids effect was mostly offset by a lower natural gas volume primarily due to warmer weather in Europe. All other items increased earnings by $320 million mainly due to gains related asset sales.","Moving to slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry oil equivalent production decreased by 2.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 73,000 barrels per day, or 3.3%. As the ramp-up at Kearl and lower downtime in several countries more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas production was down 1.2 billion cubic feet per day primarily due to lower weather related demand in Europe.","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased to $1 billion versus the fourth quarter. Realizations had a positive impact of $540 million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased $0.84 per thousand cubic feet and crude realizations were essentially flat. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $650 million, this included a substantial positive liquids mix effect associated with increased volumes in Qatar, Kearl and West Africa as well as a net over lift and including the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. The positive volume earnings factor also reflects higher natural gas volumes in Qatar. All other items had a negative impact of $190 million. Lower gains related to asset management activities were partially offset by lower operating cost.","Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Unit profitability increased to $3.40 from the fourth quarter reflecting the benefits of our broad diverse portfolio including leverage to North American natural gas, our strong LNG portfolio and the strategic choices we have made on production volumes to improve unit profitability.","Moving to slide 11, excluding the impact of Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry volumes were up 45,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or about 1% sequentially. Liquids production was up 23,000 barrels per day, or 1%. Lower downtime increased production from West Africa projects higher liquids volumes in Qatar and ramp-up at Kearl more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas volumes were up 129 million cubic feet per day reflecting higher volumes in Qatar partly offset by lower production in the United States and Europe.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $813 million, down $732 million from the first quarter of 2013 mainly due to lower refining margins across all regions. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million offset by other items for a net $70 million.","Turning to slide 13, sequentially first quarter downstream earnings decreased by $103 million primarily due to unfavorable volume and mix effects reflecting higher U.S. refining maintenance activities.","Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 14. First quarter chemical earnings were just over a $1 billion, down $90 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to lower margins. Positive volume and mix effects were offset by other items.","Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings increased by a $137 million, primarily due to higher commodity product margins and lower expenses.","Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. As we discussed in our March Analyst Meeting we are starting up a number of major projects that will deliver profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling significant progress on several of these projects.","At PNG we continue to achieve milestones that will results in the first LNG cargo [to be unloaded] ahead of schedule. We have completed the onshore and offshore sections of the pipeline which transports natural gas from the Hides gas conditioning plant up in the mountains to the LNG plant near Port Moresby. The first LNG train is now operational and the second train is mechanically complete with final commissioning underway.","Over recent weeks we started holding the first gas from Hides and in the past few days initiated LNG production. And we produced the first condensate and liquid recovered through the liquefaction process. We expect the first LNG cargo deliver in the coming weeks. These are exciting milestones for the PNG LNG project and a great achievement for our project partners, contractors and the people of Papua New Guinea.","As we mentioned in our Analyst Meeting we had overcome a number of challenges during the construction phase such as very steep slopes, flooding and lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges we are starting up several miles ahead of plan and delivering a project with one of the lowest cost per MTA relative to other LNG projects being built and in close proximity to the growing Asian market. This is also an excellent example of how ExxonMobil creates value through our leading project execution capabilities.","In Malaysia we have started our production into the Damar gas field from the first two of a total 16 wells. The Damar field has a projected capacity of 200 million cubic feet of gas per day and follows the Telok gas development which began production in 2013. These projects provide additional gas supplies to help meet Malaysia\u2019s power and industrial needs, promote growth of the country\u2019s natural gas industry and drive profitable volume growth for Exxon Mobil.","The Hibernia Southern expansion in Canada a project that will deliver a 170 million barrels of oil is progressing per plan and is now nearing completion. Installation of subsea infrastructure for the water injection facility has now been completed. Three of five platform production wells have been drilled and top side modifications to the Hibernia gravity based structure platform are 97% completed. Start-up is expected later this quarter.","At our Arkutun-Dagi in Russia we are commissioning the last few top side system at the fabrication yard. The platform drilling rig will be tested over the coming weeks. Before the 42,000 tonne topside structure is loaded out later this summer. The topside will then be floated over the gravity based structure already installed offshore Sakhalin Island. Drilling will then start and first production is expected later this year.","The Banyu Urip project in Indonesia is now 87% complete. The project will deliver 450 million barrels of oil through an onshore central processing facility with a 165,000 barrels per day of production capacity. Pipe rack construction is complete, equipment installation at the central processing facility is progressing and the onshore and offshore pipelines are installed. Conversion of the floating storage and offloading vessel is nearing completion with major equipment installed and commissioning ongoing. Two rigs are operational and the first 20 wells have been drilled. Start-up is expected around year end.","The Kearl expansion project in Canada remains slightly ahead of plan and is now more than 80% complete. We continue to ramp-up production from the Kearl initial development with 66,000 barrels per day produced during the first quarter up from 47,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year. Facility uptime performance is improving and we are achieving many days with production above 100,000 barrels per day.","Turning now to slide 17, for an update on our North American activities. We continue our commitment to deliver profitable volume growth as underscored by our efforts to increase high margins liquids production in the Permian. We had eight operated rigs running in the Permian in the first quarter and recently picked up two more in early April to continue to ramp-up drilling activity. Our current net production in the Permian is over 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.","Through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources, XTO will gain substantial operating equity in approximately 34,000 gross acres in the prolific liquids rich Wolfcamp formation. The presence of multiple stacked pay zones creates a potential for capital efficient horizontal development and the proximity to XTO\u2019s ongoing Wolfcamp operations will offer operating cost efficiencies.","The agreement increases XTO\u2019s holdings in the Permian basin to just over 1.5 million net acres, enhancing the company\u2019s significant presence in one of the major growth areas for onshore liquids production in the United States. Also during the quarter we signed an agreement with American Energy-Utica or AEU that will enable XTO to optimize funding of development cost in the Utica. As part of the agreement XTO will continue to operate in a core area of approximately 55,000 net acres in this emerging play and AEU will fund near-term development cost to earn acreage. This transaction is an example of an innovative solution to develop our extensive natural gas resources in United States in a capital efficient manner.","Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities, we are currently drilling a number of wildcat prospects from our deep and diverse opportunity portfolio, primarily concentrated in established areas. Some of this activity, includes the deepwater prospects Mica Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cominhos prospect in Angola Block 32. We also continue exploration drilling in the prolific Block 2 offshore Tanzania were somewhere between 17 and 20 TCF of gas in place has already been discovered. And a recent drill stem test on the Zafrani 2 well confirmed good reservoir quality and good connectivity in both of the reservoirs tested.","Drilling operations are also currently underway on two blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Also preparations are underway for near-term drilling that includes the [Inaudible]prospect in the Kara Sea, the broad gaining prospect in the Faroe Islands, follow up drilling to the successful Domino well in the Romanian Black Sea, the [Inaudible]well in Gabon and additional drilling prospects in Tanzania.","Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our chemical business. During the quarter we achieved notable investment milestones to grow high value product sales. For example we processed synthetic base stock investments to meet global demand growth for high performance lubricant applications. We commissioned a new 50,000 tons per year manufacturing facility in our Baytown, Texas complex and construction of our expansion project in Baton Rouge, Louisiana continued during the quarter with start-up anticipated late this year.","Both projects leverage Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology leadership to meet the industry\u2019s growing demand for advanced synthetic basestocks and improved finished lubricant performance. We also recently improved a world scale grassroots specialty polymers project in Singapore to produce halobutyl rubber to support the growing tire market in the region. In premium resins for adhesive applications such as packaging, wood working and non-molding fabrics. The project builds on the feedstock advantage and integration benefits of the recent steam cracking expansion and will allow us to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. Construction will begin this year and start-up is planned for 2017.","In conclusion in the first quarter we earned $9.1 billion, increased upstream unit profitability to $21.35 per barrel, generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations and assets sales, invested $8.4 billion in the business and distributed $5.7 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial and operating performance demonstrates progress in delivering profitable growth and achieving our business objectives outlined during our Analyst Meeting in March.","We improved our production mix and increased upstream unit profitability. We are committed to maintaining our capital spending discipline and generating strong operating cash flow to deliver robust shareholder distributions and create long-term shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We request that you limit your number of questions to two so that as many may have the opportunity to participate as possible. (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","I have a couple of questions on international E&P. First both profitability end margins were very strong and pretty much it has been in several quarters even if you normalized for the exploration in Abu Dhabi. So my question is whether there is any additional color on the positive liquid mix effects that you talked about a minute ago and whether or not there were any positive effects on the gas side that might have contributed to that result?","David Rosenthal","Yeah sure, let me take a look at the upstream earnings, we can look quarter versus quarter where I mentioned although we had a net impact of only $20 million we did have a significant impact on liquids that was about $290 million and gas was a negative $270 million on that. When you look at the production in the first quarter we saw some nice increases in Canada, Southern Russia, West Africa much lower downtime little more in the North Sea and those were benefits to us.","And the biggest decline in production was the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry which carried a little earnings effect. If you would look at that same effect sequentially where we noted we had $650 million volume mix impact, liquids was about $400 million of that and gas was about $250 million.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Okay.","David Rosenthal","So as we look at going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter similar on the liquid side we saw some increases in Qatar, increases in West Africa as well Canada with a ramp up of Kearl and then it offset with the decline in Abu Dhabi. On the gas side we also saw a nice positive mix effect volumes for example in Qatar were up and volumes in Europe which was mainly the lower margin volumes out of the Netherlands were down because of the lower demand due to the normal weather. So in both liquids and in gas sequentially we did see a nice uplift in earnings from the positive mix effect.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And so on your last comment about European natural gas most of that or all of that decline was related to weather is that the way to think about it?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. The way to think about is it was all demand driven due to weather with the bulk of it again coming out of the Netherlands where the margins are a little lower than they are than on the rest of our European sales.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks a lot David.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And from [Singular] Research we\u2019ll hear from Paul (Inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Hi David.","David Rosenthal","Hey good morning Paul how are you?","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. David can I just ask you about your CapEx and your volumes in the former case there is an enormous step down in your CapEx almost 30% which takes you well below the run rate for the year that you indicated at the Analyst Meeting is around $40 billion. Is there a reason to believe that we\u2019re coming in lower on CapEx for the year or is this \u2013 Q1 with your catch up later and therefore you would stick with the 40 or could we see some downside to that?","And if I could follow up on the volumes David the guidance at the Meeting has been flat to \u201814 over \u201813 aligned for all the adjustments that needed to be made, again your Q1 numbers are actually tracking below that. Can we expect a catch up back to flat later in the year. And final \u2013 final part if you could just address the cash account and where that sat within your volume forecast both for this year and longer-term? Thanks.","David Rosenthal","Okay, sure Paul. Let me hit CapEx first. Yeah we did come in at $8.4 billion that was down little over $3 billion from the first quarter last year. That was mainly due to the absence of the Celtic acquisition in Canada, so if you take that out from last year\u2019s results we\u2019d be pretty much flat maybe down just a little bit. As we look out across the year the first quarter is usually lower than the rest of the quarters, we tend to ramp up across the year with a little extra in the back half.","So I would say as we look at where we are today and looking out over the rest of the year the number we gave you in the Analyst Meeting is probably still a good one. I don\u2019t have an update, you know what I will say though is when we look at the first quarter CapEx it came in just about right on what we had expected. So, so far this year things are going according to plan on CapEx. On the volumes guidance we said overall we will be flat at about 4.0 million oil equivalent barrels per day year-to-year ex-Abu Dhabi about a 2% increase in liquids, about a 2% decrease in gas.","As we look at the first quarter and then across the rest of the year those numbers still look good to us. We have got some additional ramp up expected at Kearl across the year. We do expect some of these other projects I mentioned come on Papua New Guinea being one of those. So we look at the first quarter it looks real strong and certainly increases our \u2013 maintains our confidence in meeting that full year projection we shared with you in the Analyst Meeting. I think the other thing that\u2019s noteworthy when I talked about a little bit on the last question is we are seeing the impacts we are expecting on the volume mix as we reduced our exposure to some lower margin barrels and we are able to increase production in some of our higher margin areas both on the liquids and gas side.","And so that\u2019s kind of coming in as we are expecting and we talked about a little bit at the Analyst Meeting. In terms of Kashagan in the forecast for \u201814 we did not have any volumes in our outlook that we showed you in March for Kashagan for 2014.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s very helpful, David and then a quick follow-up. Your product sales were up 11% year-over-year quarter-to-quarter in the past \u2013 recent past there has been a number heavily affected by asset mix. Could you just address the scale of that jump I mean 11% growth obviously on a company of your size looks like enormously strong oil demand globally, any thoughts? Thanks","David Rosenthal","Well. Let me just clarify the question are you saying product sales or are you talking about our downstream sales or?","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, I should say to use your language exactly the petroleum product sales, if I look worldwide they are up 5.8 million barrels a day up from a year ago level of 5.7?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, we are up a little bit we have seen worldwide, we actually had some higher demand in the US actually some pretty good demand growth there. We have seen some growth in diesel as well with exports and actually some growth in Europe. So those are the two main areas but a nice quarter for us operationally as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Well I guess my question was just \u2013 which is a comparable number year-over-year or whether there was any asset mix in that so whether we could just look?","David Rosenthal","No, that\u2019s pretty comparable.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Okay, thanks very much.","David Rosenthal","Yeah. I am Sorry I didn\u2019t understand the question. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","David I wonder if I could follow-up on the other Doug\u2019s question on margins, your unit margin captures something you have told about periodically in this quarter they had a fairly nice rebound. I am just wondering if you can walk us through any particular reasons behind that and was it just a great operating quarter, how sustainable could this be. And as I can follow-on to that you are going to have about a 1 million barrels a day of new production by your forecast between \u2013 obviously that\u2019s a fairly good churn in the portfolio.","I am wondering if you could kind of just qualitatively or quantitatively whichever you can do walk through the delta you see in cash margins for the newer projects relative to the existing portfolio, please?","David Rosenthal","Sure. Let\u2019s start up with the margin and the margin capture. In addition to some of the volume mix items I mentioned. You actually have some fairly significant mix impacts on the realization side which kind of get massed by some of the markers. So for example if you look this quarter versus the same quarter last year WTI is up over 4 bucks, rents down over $4 but Western Canada Select it was up $9 a barrel as a marker for the Canadian crude.","So if you think about where we are exposed to Brent overseas a number of production, but including the Abu Dhabi barrels would have some tie to that. Whereas in the US a lot of our production particularly in the Permian would be closer to a WTI spot price and then of course all of our volumes in Canada. So it\u2019s not just Kearl you are talking about Cold Lake and our other production up there. So, think about it as the volumes that went up were attracting the higher margin or the higher price marker crudes. The volumes that declined happened to be the ones that were Brent based and again a big change in those prices did not have much of an earnings impact.","So you see a nice change on both the volume mix side as well as on the price side. So if kind of back to again and we have been talking about in the last couple of Analyst Meeting\u2019s, growing the liquids and liquids linked volumes, LNG prices were also very attractive in the quarter and we were able to capture those by having some increased volumes in Qatar. So I\u2019d say kind of on a go-forward basis this is probably more typical than what we have seen in the past again given from the mix changes I mentioned.","If we look at the barrels that we are going to be adding on equivalent basis going forward I wouldn\u2019t give any specific cash margins on those barrels but if you recall back at the Analyst Meeting some of the discussion I think Mark Albers provided in his comments we did talk about that the volumes coming online were going to be generally accretive to our average unit margin and given the fiscal regimes we would be in those projects also accretive to earnings. So I think again as we go forward over the next year or two when we start up these projects we expect to deliver the profitable growth that we talked about in the analyst meeting and we certainly look forward to these projects coming online over the next three years.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks. A very quick follow-up, could you give the absolute asset sale gain in the quarter versus the housekeeping point and I will leave it there?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, sure if you look at on an earnings basis the absolute gain on asset sales in total was just over $400 million and that was all in the upstream. So the absolute, I just gave you the numbers here for that I know there is going to be interest in the upstream the absolute value of the asset sales on earnings was about $400 million in the first quarter of this year, that compared was lower than and compared to about $800 million in the fourth quarter of last year and we didn\u2019t have any asset sales in the first quarter.","So you got about a 400 positive delta quarter-over-quarter and almost 400 delta sequentially on the negative side. The other thing I will mention to kind of put the first quarter asset sales into perspective on an absolute basis I mentioned we have 400 million in positive. We had about 200 million of negative tax items and other reserves. So if you kind of think about outside the normal operations of the business we probably had a net absolute value in the upstream of about $200 million.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot David.","Operator","And from Jefferies we will hear from Jason (Inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. Hello David.","David Rosenthal","Hey, hello Jason.","Unidentified Analyst","David I wanted to ask about the PNG LNG projects and congratulations to Exxon for bringing the project on ahead of schedule that something that hasn\u2019t been achieved in that business in quite a while.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","Wanted to ask about the pace of ramp up David, you have made reference to first commercial cargos by the end of the quarter from the first train and start-up production from the second train in several weeks. Would you expect that you could potentially be achieving full production by year-end from both trains from that project?","David Rosenthal","It\u2019s first of all thanks for the comments on the project start-up, the team is very proud of. As I mentioned bringing that in early and it looks like certainly within the budget that we had talked about and so we do look for ahead of planned production and cargo deliveries. If we look out towards the end of the year we will certainly be ramping up both the first train and the second train and assuming all that continues to go well, we would expect to see these things ramp up pretty good across the coming months. So it\u2019s a little early for me to give you a definitive answer. But I would say it\u2019s likely that by the time we get to the end of the year we are going to be running at some pretty good operating rates.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay great. And if I could ask you second one David, it\u2019s obviously pretty early days just in terms of sanctions on Russia. But have you had any effects on your ability to invest in the multiple areas where you participate with Rosneft as a partner in Russia?","David Rosenthal","With regards to Russia off-course we will comply with all sanctions, but I can tell you on the latter part of your question all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are underway and proceeding as planned.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you David.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll here from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks, good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Asit. How are you?","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good, thanks. So on PNG LNG as we get closer to the start I was wondering if you could provide some early thoughts on some incremental operational items? First wondering if you could talk about the condensate ratio, second any thoughts on train three expansion potential and finally any thoughts on LNG contract and strategy related to the pricing slope and or your spot exposure?","David Rosenthal","Sure. On the condensate ratio I really couldn\u2019t give you a specific number for the expectation there, obviously it\u2019s a very attractive stream. When we look at Train3 we are still evaluating a number of opportunities to expand the plant some of those relate to our own exploration success and other opportunities that we have on our own operated acreage as well as potential other sources of additional gas.","So that planning and looking and analyzing and discussing that process is ongoing don\u2019t have a definitive outcome for you. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks if you look at the plan as it sits today the cost per MTA in today\u2019s market is very competitive and off-course any additional capacity we take advantage of the existing infrastructure and even be more attractive so we are certainly looking at that.","If you look at our contracting strategy we entered into long-term oil index price contracts about 95% of the production is already sold under those contracts, customers being in Japan, China and Taiwan. So those contracts are locked up and then you\u2019ll have of course a little bit left over for some spot sales.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks very helpful.","David Rosenthal","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And from Wells Fargo we got Roger Read.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah, thanks. Good morning.","David Rosenthal","Hey, Roger.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Just to come back to the margin discussion and maybe as a better way to understand some of the moving parts going forward. I gather the expansion of liquids or shrinking of the gas and what that should mean from margins as well as the edition of the LNG barrels but I was wondering underlying cost. Can you give us any kind of view of what\u2019s going on there? I mean are we dealing with cost are going to go up but your margins go up faster, cost should hold flat while margins should improve from mix in price maybe a little more detail on that if you could?","David Rosenthal","You know as we look at the overall profitability as you mentioned margins are doing better with the mix that we talked about on both the oil and the gas side. In terms of OpEx we are not seeing any significant upward pressure across the portfolio. If you look at that on an absolute basis off-course OpEx is up with startup of some of our big projects Kearl would be a good example on that as we progress from the startup phase last year and to lining up production and ramping up this year you get some benefit of that.","We did see some lower exploration expense in the first quarter this year as you recall in last year in the second half we booked some fairly heavy exploration expense mainly attributed to our business in Russia and that was a little lower this quarter but as expected. So I\u2019d say overall when you think about the margin capture and the profit capture again it\u2019s the mix that we\u2019ve talked about in particular as we ramp up these projects across the quarter.","I think the other thing I might add is on the unconventional side we continue to make good progress driving cost down in the areas that we are operating as we\u2019ve talked about before the combination of ExxonMobil\u2019s technology and XTO\u2019s operating experience. We are really starting to see the leverage we get by combining those particularly as we continue to acquire attractive acreage as I mentioned in the Permian would be a good example of that. So across that portfolio that trend continues to be positive in terms of reducing cost and improving capital efficiency. So that part of the business is also doing well.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, great, thanks. And then a follow-up question. Recent headlines indicated Argentina is going to actually be importing some crude obviously you are a major mover and shaker in Vaca Muerta shale. I was wondering have you seen any indications from the Argentinean government that they are willing to be I don\u2019t know a good term flexible in terms of helping to accelerate activity down there?","David Rosenthal","I\u2019ll take the last part of your question first. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the government about fiscal terms and stability and I don\u2019t have anything definitive to report on that but those discussions are ongoing. We have seen some positive signals out of the government recently in terms of improving export and import conditions and what we are doing there. These are certainly positive steps that could lead to an attractive business environment. But it\u2019s all part of progressing the programs and determining commerciality.","Obviously there is a huge potential resource in Argentina called the Vaca Muerta. We continue to have an active program there I think we\u2019ve got a total of six wells down. We\u2019ve been drilling vertical wells in prior to this year, we are starting to drill our first operated horizontal wells. First one is down and second one is drilling and we\u2019ll be getting the third one down shortly. Again without being specific, I can tell you that the data so far from our drilling and delineation is encouraging but it\u2019s still early days to determine actual commerciality. But if you get the combination of good fiscal terms of stability and good resource development that generally leads to a commercial resource development for you.","So we continue to actively pursue that but again for us it\u2019s a very large resource, we got in at a very low entry cost and very low commitment. And so that allows us to really go about this in a disciplined manner and really utilize some of the expertise XTO has to help us explore and delineate the resource without having to spend a whole lot of money upfront. So again we are encouraged and that piece of the business is moving along very well.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Faisal Khan with Citi.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Hey, good morning it\u2019s Faizal from Citi.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Faizal.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Thanks, David. If you could \u2013 you talked a little bit about sort of the increase in profitability in the upstream business, you also discussed LNG sort of prices. Can you remind us how much of your total LNG volumes are exposed to the spot market?","David Rosenthal","You know I don\u2019t have a total global number on that. I think probably what would be more indicative is if you look at \u2013 if you take the U.S. aside of course and you look at our total LNG volumes. Most of those are going at oil index prices but the rest of them by and large are going into the Asia Pacific rim. And so the spot prices there are fairly close to the oil index prices and so you are getting a nice benefit there. As well the occasional cargo that goes into Europe goes into the spot price but those are attractive as well.","So regardless of how the cargo is going either directly or indirectly \u2013 most of them or probably all of it about 5% are either oil indexed or getting the equivalent type prices.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay. I guess I was just trying to understand the commentary given that oil prices haven\u2019t moved all that much sequentially quarter to quarter but it sounded like that was a typically strong point for you in the quarter.","David Rosenthal","Thank you. It was and a lot of it is the mix on where these cargo\u2019s get delivered and whether they are going to Europe or they are going to the Asia Pacific rim or whether you have a little higher proportion going into your fixed contracts versus your spot. So we did see a little uplift on those prices as you know not all those contracts are the same in terms of how they look back and what the formula is. But if we look across for example our LNG realizations out of Qatar and you are just looking quarter-on-quarter this year to last year we were up a little over a $1 a KCF.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay.","David Rosenthal","So, again a nice piece of business.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Yeah. And thanks I appreciate that detail. And then just back to Russia for a second I believe you guys have some sort of asset swap sort of arrangement with Rosneft that sort of protects you in case some of the investments get stranded in Russia. Can you just walk us through a little bit of that in case there are sanctions as there are [Inaudible]here in the U.S with the sort of assets that Rosneft has swapped into with you and that sort [Inaudible]you guys put together?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. I really can\u2019t comment on the terms and conditions of those pieces of business other than yeah we have the projects that we have in Russia and they farmed into some of our properties on a normal farming basis just like anybody else would. But any discussion of contractual details or commercial arrangements really couldn\u2019t comment on.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay. Got it. Thanks David. I appreciate the time.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And from Barclays we\u2019ll hear from Paul Cheng.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey guys. Good morning.","David Rosenthal","Hi Paul. How are you doing?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hi, very good. Dave, two quick questions. One you told about the over \u2013 benefit in the first quarter. Can you give us or quantify what\u2019s the volume and also the dollar value and also at the end of the first quarter whether from an inventory standpoint you are roughly [Inaudible] or underneath?","David Rosenthal","Sure. If you are looking in the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Can we look at relative to the \u2013 to your production actually?","David Rosenthal","Sure. I mean we are about 15 kbd over lifted in the quarter, yeah on an absolute basis were about 15 kbd over lifted and I would estimate that to be about worth about a $100 million.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And that at the end of the first quarter are you [Inaudible] balance at this point?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. If we look at where we are just at the end of the first quarter I think we are over lifted just a little bit so we are not completely in balance but we are fairly close.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Second question on Permian right now you are running at 10 rigs. Is there any color or insight you can provide on what this [Inaudible]going to [Inaudible]look like over the next two or three years. You just add two should we assume that you will continue to ramp up the program there. And also whether you can tell us the $90,000 barrel per day production, what\u2019s the mix between light oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. Let me start with the first part. We are of course ramping up activity in the Permian. We are doing it like we always do in a very disciplined approach you don\u2019t want to get too far out in front your headlight. So we have been building that rig count over the first last few quarters I did mention the additional acreage that we picked up in a very attractive area in the Wolfcamp.","So as we move on I would expect the trajectory to be the same but I don\u2019t have any specific count for you. Again in a lot of these areas we are still delineating, we are still appraising, we are still experimenting with how we go about drilling and completing wells and that sort of thing. But I think directionally given the quality of the acreage that we have and the results we have had to date I think it would be a reasonable expectation that we would likely grow that rig count over the course of the year I think that will be logical. But again always in a manner that keeps in mind the long term development of these resources and not getting out too far in front and doing something that you regret later.","So it\u2019s all about assessing what we\u2019ve got, we are very, very pleased with our acreage and then ramping up that production as is appropriate and leading towards that outlook we gave you in the Analyst Meeting that showed a nice way up between now and 2017 in total North American\u2019s liquid production but the Permian seems to be a big part of that. In terms of the on split on the liquids versus NGLs versus condensates I don\u2019t have that split for you, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And from Credit Suisse we\u2019ll hear from Edward Westlake.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey yes. Good morning, David. Three very quick tail end questions. People have said and thanks by the way for the helpful color on Asia LNG and well done on the execution of some of the key projects. Some of the people have shouted out a gas marketing benefit in given the cold winter in the U.S, did you guys have any something there that we should think about?","David Rosenthal","Well I mean we benefited from the higher gas prices but other than that we certainly don\u2019t do any trading if that\u2019s what you are looking at. So let me if that was the question let me be clear all of our earnings uplift comes from the production and sale of our gas we don\u2019t do any trading.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Good. And then switching to the international chemicals I mean obviously 4Q was weak and you\u2019ve seen a bit of a comeback in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about you shouted out lower other expenses maybe just a bit of shout on what\u2019s happening there.","David Rosenthal","Sure. If we just as so we weren\u2019t from the fourth quarter into the first quarter this year we didn\u2019t have some significantly lower maintenance expense you might recall in the fourth quarter. It was pretty high, we had some turnaround activity going on in Singapore and that\u2019s all behind us and that\u2019s the biggest driver in that other bucket.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","So it\u2019s not a sort of fee change in demand that you see in the chemical chain?","David Rosenthal","I wouldn\u2019t say a fee change but I would say that we are seeing some encouraging signs the integrated chemical chain or seeing some pickup in demand polyethylene sales have been good and we continue to see some nice demand pickup there. We did also see some pickup which was seasonal between the fourth quarter and the first quarter in our specialties business. But on the other hand aromatics demand is weak strictly in this, so there are some offsets. But I think generally speaking we have seen a little better demand, we have been able to sell the increased production out of Singapore so that part of the business is going well.","So I think as you kind of go from fourth quarter to first quarter in the chemical business, lower maintenance as we move into the \u2013 from the first quarter to the second quarter as you are probably aware we are heading under a higher maintenance period. The chem plant for example came down in early April and is down for a couple of months\u2019 turnaround, so we will see that impact. But a really nice first quarter operations on the chemical side I think our capacity utilization particularly in North America where of course we get a nice margin benefit I think we were running about 2% or 3% on a capacity utilization better than industry.","So that\u2019s not only good in total but on the margin those couple percent really, really ring the cash register for you on those sales. So good quarter for us in the chemical business.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And just on the cash flow statement working capital contribution in the quarter?","David Rosenthal","Our working capital contributions I recall just under $2 billion about $1.8 billion and that was just a change in payables.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right.","David Rosenthal","I think not a real big effect if you think about total cash flows a number less than $2 billion in the quarter but it was payables driven.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then one bigger picture question. They always talk about Shell but I mean obviously you\u2019ve been doing a lot of offshore exploration as well. When do you think you will get to the point where you can sort of update us in terms of actually getting after to sort of developing some of these deep water fields that you\u2019ve got in the portfolio?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. I think as-soon-as we have a little better indication exactly on what we\u2019ve got in some of these areas, one that I can mention is Tanzania where we have had significant success and our planning is underway as we speak not only with our partner in Block 2 Statoil but also with BG and Ophir broadly across Tanzania.","So we are working at evaluating potential sites for an LNG facility and we have made a recommendation to the government and studies are progressing you know to really determine what would be the optimum development plan for our block and across that area.","So I would say all of that is progressing as you would expect for a resource of that size. But I can\u2019t give you a definitive development plan or timing yet. Julie is another deepwater project that\u2019s well underway and we\u2019ll start drilling there this year. We\u2019ve got more drilling to do in Romania where we had a very nice successful initial well there. So a lot going in some very attractive areas, but probably still just a little early to be talking definitive development plans or startups or FIDs or that sort of things.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","And next from Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll hear from Evan Calio.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, good afternoon David. More housekeeping from me, exploration expenses much lower in the quarter like 338 versus normal. Is that just timing event or is there any exploration spend trending over there.","David Rosenthal","I wouldn\u2019t say there is any lower trend, it\u2019s really particularly if you look quarter-on-quarter it was really just timing of expenditure, particularly in Russia and some other areas, but the program remains on track, on schedule. And I think you\u2019ll probably see a little more normalized kind a trend as we go out into the year.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. On the asset again and you gave just color earlier, the included income. Was that in international upstream gaining more?","David Rosenthal","That was in international upstream.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. And maybe just lastly from me with cash builds equaling asset sales for you in the quarter, what was the consideration to for holding the buyback flat sequentially. And then how do you what do you need to see you think to raise it. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Yes I wouldn\u2019t. No change in our strategy with regard to shareholder distributions in general. You saw we got a nice 9.5% bump in the dividend this quarter continuing a nice trend that you\u2019ve seen the last few years. So growing that dividend and making sure it\u2019s reliable and consistent continues to be at the top of the list for shareholder distribution. The buyback continues to be [out]. But the cash we have and although we do look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are always thinking into account cash flow projections and business and that\u2019s sort of thing.","So again on a company our size, plus or minus the $1 billion not a big number. I do think that it\u2019s noteworthy if you look at the free cash flow for example in the quarter particularly relative to the last few quarters, we did generate a total of $16 billion, put a bunch of that into the business funded the both the dividend and the buyback, and still had $2 billion over half we paid down debt and half we increased cash. So again if you\u2019re looking kind a sequentially across the last few quarters, very strong quarter in cash flow consistent with the strong quarter in earnings.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And from Raymond James we\u2019ll go Pavel Molchanov.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks for taking the question. One more on the cash allocation, by my math this will the first quarter that your dividend payout $[40] billion equals your share buyback. Is that deliberate and do you see the Q lines kind a continuing to cross that line?","David Rosenthal","I would say that was a coincidence. It\u2019s not a there is not deliberate effort to match those out or more change any ratios to that\u2019s sort.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And this maybe most relevant for your German acreage, but in the context of the Ukrainian crisis and lot of rhetoric in Europe about ramping up shale development, any sense that permitting in Germany or elsewhere in Europe is starting to open up?","David Rosenthal","No, I don\u2019t have any indication of that. There is a lot of discussion going on as you\u2019re all aware but nothing definitive nothing different than what\u2019s been going on. As you know we have a very attractive acreage position in Germany and we\u2019ve been in discussions with the regulators for a while on the potential of that resource and those in fact the discussions are going but nothing is specific to report on today.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thank you guys.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","We have one question left in the queue and that will come from Peter [Hudson] with RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. Just two quick follow ups. Kashagan you said no volumes is expect, kind of expected anyway in 2014. But I wonder whether you could say what do you had in your plans for 2016 and what those still are? And also on the upside you are talking about Tanzania. Is taken quite some time since the recommendation has gone in about the location of the plant facility. But still nothing is come out.","Do we have a timing of when we might get that as the next catalyst in that area? And then finally, the downstream, you stress the words on the international downstream that was a least quite a lower than the number of people had expected, profitability levels back to the sort of early 2009.","One of your competitors took a big impairment on the refining assets in Asia and are being very clear about the weakness, structural weakness in that market. Is there something that you\u2019re seeing such as that and expect to continue out into the medium and long-term as well. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Let me take those in order here. In Kashagan as I mentioned in the outlook, we showed in March we did not a value for 2014. We did have some volumes in 2015. I don\u2019t want to give a specific number here today, but we did have assumed some production volume in 2015. In Tanzania, we don\u2019t have any final determination on the site, but I will tell you the discussions are ongoing and going well. Nothing out of the ordinary and the plans for that are progressing at an appropriate pace.","So I think I will stop there. So we look at the downstream on the international side, yes you did see some weak earnings there overall. We had a positive impact in Canada, if you saw the IOL results out this morning, very nice business there. We\u2019re running obviously vantage crews into this refinery. And that keeps the business just going well. Outside of Canada, the rest, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pac were weak. The biggest driver there is the margin.","You had some surplus refining capacity come online in that area of the world last couple of years. And the advance are a little weak so you got some capacity expansion and excess of demand growth. We do see some weakness there. We are doing a number of things to improve our profitability there and improve our competitiveness.","We\u2019ve been spending sometime on logistics and expanding feedstock flexibility, working to increase exposure to high value product yields and less exposure to lower margin products, continuing to work on operating expense and maximizing the logistics benefits we get both from the location of our refineries particularly in Europe, but also that integration, full integration with the chemical business and the lose business which is doing quite well.","So I think if you look at that business it\u2019s weak it\u2019s been weak for a little while. These are always cyclical business both in Europe and in the US and in the Asia-Pacific rim. So you wouldn\u2019t want to take current results and draw a long-term trend. We\u2019re doing what we can, controlling what we can control. And really it\u2019s about making sure your refineries and your plans for that matter in any region are the most competitive in that region. And that\u2019s what benefits you over the long term.","When you talk about a potential impairment, we follow US GAAP with regard to impairment, and we look at that as appropriate, but from our perspective and this preference from company to follow IFRS accounting rules when we look at the US GAAP accounting we don\u2019t see any exposure to that in that part of the world.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Great, thank you.","David Rosenthal","Yes one of the things you might recall just quickly when you look across both the downstream and the chemical segment bear in mind the significant advantage we have on an ROCE basis to the rest of the industry. So when you look at the denominator when you look at the capital employed in our business both on the chemical side and on the downstream side, our capital employed tends to be in order of magnitude lower than the others.","So that helps generate the ROCEs but also gives you feel for how much capital is on the book. And then the other thing of course we benefit from is the level integration we have. So we even as refining cycle is one way and chemical is on other one you get some offsets and when they\u2019re both on an upswing that\u2019s where you see the benefit of that integration, so. Across the business we continue to do well to generate the highest returns in the business and just don\u2019t have any long-term concerns.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thanks very much.","David Rosenthal","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And Mr. Rosenthal there are no other questions at this time.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes today\u2019s presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation."],"8535":["Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 28, 2017  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey J.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. The comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2.","Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4 billion in the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $8.9 billion, more than covering both dividends and net investments in the business for the second consecutive quarter. We achieved solid results from each of our business segments and remain steadfast on managing costs and operating efficiently. In the first quarter, we continued advancing strategic opportunities to grow value through disciplined investment, portfolio acquisitions and high-impact exploration.","Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. The global economy started the year with modest growth. In the United States, expansion slowed in the first quarter. However, growth rates were stable in China and Europe and appear to have slightly improved in Japan. The commodity price environment improved in the quarter, as both crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened.","As a result, the global rig count increased, driven primarily by higher activity in the U.S. Refining margins also improved, with global demand growth, heavier industry downtime and seasonal product inventory draw. Further, global chemical commodity margins increased on higher realizations, with industry polyethylene capacity utilization remaining strong in advance of U.S. Gulf Coast expansions.","Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil first quarter earnings were $4 billion or $0.95 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down nearly 19% from the prior year quarter, as the corporation continues disciplined execution of its investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.9 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.9 million. A debt was $43.6 billion net debt, which is debt less cash, declined in the quarter.","Debt was impacted by the funding of the escrow account for the contingent resource payment associated with the InterOil acquisition. These funds, which totaled $1.7 billion, were loaned back to the company for the escrow account. Now, this impact is temporary, as ExxonMobil acquired a receivable as part of the InterOil deal, which is expected to more than cover the contingent resource payment.","The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $8.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.","Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion, which included the $1.7 billion to fund the escrow account I previously mentioned.","Debt and other financing items decreased cash by $100 million, which included the impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. Cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered dividends and net investments with an excess of $1.3 billion.","Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.77 per share, representing a 2.7% increase from last quarter and marking our 35th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. In the quarter, ExxonMobil continued to limit share repurchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the second quarter.","Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings increased $2.2 billion from the year ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream results. Further gains in the Downstream were offset by lower Chemical results and higher Corporate and Financing expenses.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, absent the fourth quarter 2016 Upstream impairment charge, earnings increased over $300 million due to strong results from the Upstream and Chemical businesses. This was partly offset by higher Corporate costs driven by the absence of last quarter's favorable one-time non-U.S. tax items.","On average, we expect Corporate and Financing expenses will continue to be between $400 million and $600 million per quarter in the near-term. I'll note our corporate effective tax rate was 38% during the quarter, up from 19% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time items.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 9. First quarter Upstream earnings were $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the prior quarter due to higher realizations. Crude prices increased more than $19 a barrel versus the year ago quarter and gas realizations increased nearly $1 per thousand cubic feet.","Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $150 million, largely because of lower entitlements and higher maintenance. All other items increased earnings $170 million, driven by lower operating costs. Upstream unit profitability for the first quarter was $6.19 per barrel, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","So moving now to slide 10, oil equipment production in the quarter was 4.2 million barrels per day, a decrease of 4% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Liquids production was down 205,000 barrels per day, the result of lower entitlements and increased maintenance. New project volumes more than offset field decline. Natural gas production increased to 184 million cubic feet per day, as volumes from new projects and higher demand more than offset field decline and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands.","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings were $867 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, when the effect of last quarter's impairment charge is excluded. Our realizations contributed $570 million of earnings. Crude prices increased nearly $3 per barrel and gas realizations increased nearly $0.50 per thousand cubic feet. All other items added $300 million, again, largely the result of lower operating expenses.","Moving to slide 12, sequentially, volumes increased about 1% or 30,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production decreased about 50,000 barrels per day because of lower entitlements, whereas new project volumes offset higher downtime. Natural gas production increased 484 million cubic feet per day, due to ramp-up of recent project startups, increased demand and lower downtime.","Moving now to the Downstream financial operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up $210 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $160 million, mainly from increased operational efficiency which resulted in higher throughput. All other items added $40 million, mostly from minor asset management activities, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings decreased sequentially by $125 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $220 million, primarily driven by higher planned maintenance.","All other items reduced earnings by a further $110 million, driven by higher turnaround costs and the absence of fourth quarter asset management gains of more than $500 million from the Imperial Oil's retail network sale. Now this was partially offset by lower operating costs and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory impacts.","Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15. First quarter Chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, down $184 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker margins, primarily from specialty products, decreased earnings by $70 million. All other items decreased earnings by $110 million, largely due to increased turnaround expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings improved sequentially about $300 million. Stronger commodity margins increased earnings by $170 million, as higher realizations outpaced rising feed and energy costs. All other items increased earnings $140 million, primarily reflecting lower expenses and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects.","Turning to slide 17 and our business highlights. First, a strategic acquisition in Mozambique. ExxonMobil signed an agreement to acquire a 25% indirect interest in Area 4, offshore Mozambique, for cash consideration of $2.8 billion. The deepwater Area 4 block is estimated to contain more than 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in place, with high expected well deliverability, underpinning a world-class LNG project.","We believe the project will be well positioned to supply LNG customers in markets around the world. ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operations of the planned onshore facilities, including liquefaction trains with capacity of up to 40 million tons per annum. As such, ExxonMobil will contribute its expertise in project execution and operations to support the project's success in a globally competitive LNG market. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. After it has closed, the partners will optimize development plans and determine key milestones such as FID and startup timing accordingly.","Now elsewhere in Mozambique, we are evaluating three high-potential blocks for which we were awarded the right to negotiate exploration and production rights. We participated in a multi-client 3-D seismic survey which was completed in November of last year. We look forward to finalizing discussions with the government of Mozambique on PSEs for these blocks.","Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our project and exploration activity. To begin with, ExxonMobil closed two significant acquisitions this quarter. The first was the InterOil deal with assets in Papua New Guinea. We are now engaging with co-venturers to assess optimal development of discovered, undeveloped resources, both legacy and acquired. The Antelope-7 appraisal well is complete and the interim resource recertification process has been initiated and will be completed later this year.","The second transaction was our acquisition of companies owned by the Bass family, which more than doubled our Permian Basin resources. An integrated asset team is in place to manage these newly acquired properties. In order to fully capitalize on the advantages offered by the highly contiguous acreage position and our participation across the full value chain, the team is leveraging corporate expertise in unconventional development, research, project management and logistics. We do expect to spud the first well on the new acreage shortly.","Next, we continue to selectively invest in projects across the value chain. We currently have 18 major projects in execution across all business segments. In the Upstream, this includes projects such as Hebron and Odoptu Stage 2. Commissioning work's progressing well on both of these projects, which are expected to start up before year-end, adding a combined gross production capacity of 215,000 barrels of oil per day.","In the Downstream, the Antwerp coker project will start up later this year, delivering higher value products including ultra-low sulfur diesel, and the chemical expansion project at Baytown and Mont Belvieu will begin a phased startup in the second half of the year.","In other recent developments, in Australia, Train Three at Gorgon-Jansz started up in March. All three trains are now available to ramp up to full plant capacity of 15.6 million tons per annum.","Turning to exploration, we remain focused on adding resources that are attractive in the current price environment. We recently announced the Snoek discovery in Guyana with reservoirs similar in age to the prior discoveries at Liza and Payara. The rig has moved to the Liza-4 appraisal well, which is evaluating the east flank of the Liza field. A well test is expected to begin on this well next month. After Lisa-4, the rig will drill a delineation well at Payara and we'll also test a deeper exploration prospect.","We also continue to capture new high potential acreage around the world. In the U.S., ExxonMobil is the current high bidder on 19 blocks in the central Gulf of Mexico. In Papua New Guinea, a recent farm-in to two offshore blocks was ratified by the government. These blocks are just 60 miles south of our LNG facilities. The initial scope of work is expected to include seismic acquisition.","And finally, in Cyprus, we were awarded an exploration and production-sharing contract for offshore Block 10 with our long-standing partner, Qatar Petroleum. The contract includes commitments to acquire 3-D seismic data and drill two exploration wells, with the first well anticipated in 2018. I'll note this block is near the recent Zora discovery.","Moving now to the final slide, the corporation remains committed to growing value across our integrated businesses. All three of our business segments contributed to solid performance in the quarter, together earning $4 billion while remaining highly focused on business fundamentals. Upstream production volumes were consistent with plans at 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Total CapEx was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 19% from the prior quarter.","The corporation has remained disciplined in its investment program, selectively advancing strategic opportunities across the value chain while maintaining focus on capital efficiencies. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $8.9 billion and free cash flow was $4.9 billion, more than covering $3.1 billion in quarterly shareholder dividends even after funding the escrow account for the InterOil transaction.","We remain committed to our shareholders as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. Regardless of the business cycle, we are confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to create shareholder value over the long term.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be very happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we will take our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning, Jeff. How are you?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Brad. I'm doing well. How are you?","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good, good. Thanks. So a couple of questions on LNG. Obviously that and Mozambique now \u2013 that goes into a really long LNG queue, so you've got P&G, Golden Pass, Scarborough, the list sort of goes on and on. I'm curious how you think about the order of priority there? And just generally, how much room you think there is for more LNG in the portfolio?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, good question, Brad. I think I'd start first with the second question, and really think about our energy outlook and our long-term view on demand, and particularly as it relates to LNG. So to start off, as you know, we have gas growing from 2015 to 2014 at about 1.5% per year, in fact becoming the second highest source of supply overtaking coal for the obvious environmental benefits.","On an LNG basis, over that same time period, out to 2040, we have LNG capacity and thus demand growing by about 250%. So there is the business case right there. Now obviously like any type of supply\/demand mechanics, you're going to see periods of tightness, periods where there's excess demand and requires a supply response.","So as you highlighted, Brad, moving into your second \u2013 your first question, there are a number of LNG projects that we are concurrently progressing. I will tell you that not all of them will move at the same pace. We've got a good diverse portfolio, some that are associated with Brownfield expansions to existing facilities, such as the Papua New Guinea or the Golden Pass. And then others more large greenfield developments like Mozambique.","Each of them have unique characteristics that we're going to try to place them in the market, but it's not choosing one or the other at this point. It's a matter of moving them all forward, and depending on all the different variables that have to work for a multi-billion dollar investment, some will come to maturity quicker.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess digging in slightly on Mozambique, I was curious if you foresee any changes to the development plan as it's been laid out in the past, I'm specifically thinking about coral and how you feel about the floating LNG plan there.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Brad, I would tell you that obviously we've got to wait for the regulatory approvals to be concluded and then get with the co-venturers and have discussions. But the current plan is that coral will progress.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And we will now hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Jeff, always appreciate your perspective on the oil macro. Brent's really still trying to get some legs under it here in 2017. Where does Exxon believe we are in terms of the crude rebalancing process? We appreciate your views on OPEC\/non-OPEC in demand.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. That's a good question. Clearly, I would say that the macro would still indicate, from an ExxonMobil perspective, still indicate the need to be cautious going forward. As we've talked in the past, underlying demand growth has been generally strong. We're seeing demand growth of about 1.4 million barrels a day, similar to last year. And that's above the 10-year average. As we would've expected, we're seeing a supply-side response to supply and demand coming into balance, and we do see that non-OPEC volumes are growing particularly driven by North America, and specifically the unconventionals.","And you think over the last recent period, unconventionals have grown to, round numbers, about 800,000 barrels a day on trend to maybe 1 million barrels a day over a 12-month period. So I think it all indicates the importance of making sure that we are very thoughtful about the near- and longer-term macro environment.","On an OPEC basis, as you've seen, OPEC has generally met their commitments. A little bit short, but they are demonstrating a level of compliance. But when you step back and look at the supply side, I think is the biggest issue in front of us, and that would be a function of so many elements, including the North American response I talked about, but also economic growth and other variables. Remember, we still have round numbers about 600 million barrels in storage, and depending on what near-term prices do, that's going to come out at some point. So a lot of variables to think about, and that's what really underpins my comment about just being cautious.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that, Jeff. And the follow-up is that, just want to talk about your long-term growth aspirations in two regions that don't always get a ton of attention. And the first would be Iraq and the second would be Russia. Any comments on either of those, it would be helpful.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, let me start with Russia. I mean, as everybody clearly knows that the sanctions remain in place, and that I want be very clear that we remain in full compliance with those sanctions. And therefore, not a whole lot is being done there other than our assets on the East Coast that are not included within the sanction restrictions.","And I'll tell you, that development has continued to perform exceptionally well. I mentioned in the prepared comments that we've got the next phase of development there with the Odoptu Stage 2 starting up by the end of the year and it's moved remarkably well and we've got a very, very strong co-venturer there that supports our activities.","In terms of Iraq, we are running generally consistent in terms of our production activities. I mean, the key for Iraq will be ongoing investment to build up capacity for water injection, to maintain reservoir pressure in these big very large oil fields. We'll continue to invest to build that capacity commensurate with the availability of the required infrastructure and we'll just need to see how that plays out over time. We're actively involved with other co-venturers and the government to address the future requirements.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And our next participant is Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, first question just on the capital spending, obviously, was trending well below the full-year expectation in the first quarter. Maybe you could just give us a little bit of color about how you might expect that to progress for the year. Are there going to be significant ramps as we progress through the year? And I guess, specifically, I see that the U.S. number on E&P was actually down quarter-over-quarter and I know from the Analyst Day, ramping shales is a big focus; so maybe any color you can give on rig count today and where you hope to be, perhaps, by year-end.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Will do. Let me first talk about our CapEx. I mean there really is no change right now, Phil, to our CapEx guidance. I will continue to emphasize that the organization has done a remarkable job in identifying and capturing capital efficiencies. I mean, I think that is a huge opportunity for value growth in the future. I think you saw that, if you recall, our actual spend last year was down materially versus our guidance and that was, in part, due to the organization's focus on this important area.","So $22 billion is still our guidance. If you remember in the analyst presentation, we gave a breakdown on how we plan to spend that and what key areas that we're planning to focus on. You mentioned the short cycle program which, I'll just remind, is not only unconventional, but also a very significant component of a conventional work program. But if you look at our total rigs in the U.S. unconventional, they have gone from 13 in the fourth quarter and we're now up to 18 rigs. So we are starting to ramp that activity. As I said in the prepared comments, in the Delaware acreage that we recently picked up, we've got a very concerted focus to this effort and we should have a rig on site here soon and we'll continue to ramp up activity in that property.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And where might you hope to be in rig counts by year-end in order to achieve some of your production goals for the next one to two years?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, Phil, I don't really have a number to share with you on that, but I will tell you that as we signaled previously, our intent was to pick up in the order of magnitude, order, range of about 15 rigs in that Delaware acreage over time. Whether that happens by the end of the year or that happens later into the following year, I really can't go ahead and give you a more exact number. But it will be a function of a number of factors. Remember we are looking at this from a value chain perspective and we're working on all the elements to make sure that we can, when we make the investment, that we can get that product all the way to the consumer.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, okay. And just my follow-up would be on the chemicals project. You mentioned the phased ramp as the year progresses. I guess what I'm wondering is maybe a little bit more color around when you might expect a full actual contribution from the cracker? Would you be thinking by early 2018, you might be up at a full run rate? Or might it take a bit longer than that? Just any additional clarity.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Let me say, first of all, just to remind everybody that it's another 1.5 million tons per annum of capability and then corresponding derivative units to provide high-quality calcium polyethylene products. The construction has been going extremely well. We expect that we'd be starting up the full facility by the end of the year into the next part of the year, so there will be some time to ramp up thereafter.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, Jeff and team.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","I have a couple of questions on pay-for-performance per your new documents. First, when you consider that ExxonMobil's performance peers only posted a TSR of about a third or so of S&P 500 during the past decade, it seems like the bar could be higher for comparative purposes and that shareholders may be better served if it were. And while you outperformed most of these companies, Jeff, my question is how does the company think about the need to stretch the objective in this particular area as some of the peers have done?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I think we have a very unique executive compensation program, Doug, as we've talked in the past, with a large part of the compensation really at risk based on the corporation's performance, particularly on its stock performance. Just to remind everybody that our long-term performance is based on a 5-, and a 10-year vesting, and the 10-year is really the latter of 10 years or retirement. So therefore, some can go even beyond 10 years. So it really does incentivize management to focus on our fundamental mission as a corporation and that is to grow shareholder value.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","That's right. And so let's stay on that for a second because it is the season on pay-for-performance, and during the past nine years, Rex was awarded I think around 225,000 shares every year, even though there was pretty insignificant variability in industry conditions, company performance, et cetera. So my question on that, Jeff, is what is it in the compensation system that drives this apparent mismatch between low variability and the pay factor, or one of them that is, and high variability in the industry and company outcomes? Meaning is it as simple as following a heavy weighting on the part that aligns CEO pay with the compensation and performance peers which is, I think, considered good corporate governance? Is it investment lead times? Or is it something else? Or either way, how do you expect this correlation between these variables to change in the future, if you think that it will?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, Doug, I mean I think I would just focus on ExxonMobil and the structure that we've put in place and how it has really proven over time.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Right.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","If you look at the way the Compensation Committee considers this, there are seven key areas that we're thinking about and they really focus on all of those areas in terms of deciding whether we have achieved first quartile performance. And they're thinking about it over the investment lead times, so we're not looking at the given year, we're looking at it over a period of time, and particularly focused on the return on capital employed and our safety performance.","And that is what sets and determines whether the corporation is, or that the most senior executives have achieved first quartile performance, which then sets the award amounts. And we think that that is working extremely well and it really does very much align the executives with that of the performance of shareholders. I mean, a very clear correlation that we have got to focus on that shareholder return as job number one.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And you guys did a good job of laying it out this year in my opinion. So thanks for that, Jeff, and thanks again.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet. Thank you.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah.","Operator","We will now hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff, good morning, everybody. Jeff, I wonder if I could go back to the CapEx question. The $22 billion guidance for this year, does that include the acquisition in Mozambique?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes, it does.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So your actual CapEx, your organic CapEx then is obviously closer to $18.5 billion, $19 billion then. Is that right?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Well, it'd be the $22 billion minus the $2.8 billion.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, okay. Yes, I can do the math. Thanks so much for that. Well, I guess just a related question, then. Is 25% of Block 4 enough to do things the Exxon way? Meaning, you typically bring in Qatargas as a partner, Golden Pass, I guess being the most recent case in point, and I guess you know where I'm going with this. Do you think Block 1 is necessary for you to move forward? Or can you move forward with Block 4 as it stands? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Well listen, I mean, Doug, I mean I understand the point of the question. Clearly, we did the deal with the expectation that we're going to move forward with co-venturers on Area 4, and we think it's an accretive opportunity to our overall value proposition given the diversity of our existing portfolio. As I mentioned, Doug, we also have what we consider as high-potential exploration acreage that we're going to continue to progress. So, I mean standalone, as it is right now, the acquisition was premised on a very successful and competitive LNG development on Area 4.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. My follow-up is on Guyana, Jeff. If I heard you correct, you said you're planning a well test on Liza-4. I'm assuming that means Lisa-4 was spud 31st of March, if I understand correctly. Does that mean Lisa-4, you're declaring that a success this morning? And if so, can you give us an update on next steps as it relates to FID, first oil because I think the license you applied for is second half of 2019 versus 2020? And just any color you can give on next steps would be great. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. So the Liza-4 is still drilling, to be clear. Following the completion of that well, we would then go ahead and move into a test, and as I said, the rig would then move over to Payara for the delineation well that will allow us to not only do the delineation in Payara, but also this deep exploration prospect. The well itself will be integrated; the results of the Liza-4 well will be integrated into our development planning activities that ultimately will inform a FID decision on the initial phase at Guyana.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, no update on timing on FID?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I'm sorry. Say again, Doug?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No updating on timing of a final investment decision?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Midyear.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Midyear. Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So normalizing your CapEx for the full year run rate and taking out asset sales, you spent in line with distributed cash in the first quarter \u2013 you spent in line with cash, sorry, in the first quarter. Went for an average $54. Crude is lower. Clearly, investment sentiment is lower. You mentioned a cautious near-term crude outlook, but can you discuss the factors that the board considered when raising the dividend? Whether that's the balance sheet or the short cycle element or future margins? Just kind of give us some color to delays against an increasingly gloomier outlook?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I think the first thing I would say, Evan, is that it really does reflect the confidence that the board and senior management has in the efficiency of the integrated business model, recognizing that we're going to see peaks and valleys in a commodity-priced business and that we have built the business to be durable in a low-price environment. So, I mean it really talks to the business model at the start.","The second point I would make is that we have thoroughly communicated through the years that a reliable and growing dividend is clearly the priority. Now putting that aside as, if you will, the backdrop to the decision, then it's looking forward and looking at the investment plans that we have and understanding how we're going to continue to grow value within the corporation.","So I think it's all those factors. And remember, when we're thinking about our investment planning, Evan, we're thinking about it consistent with a long-term view, a constructive view on supply and demand. So it's about making sure that we're comfortable that we're going to continue to generate, from our perspective, industry-leading returns and continue to grow value.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That makes sense. And my second question is on Guyana. I know Technip earlier this week announced that it won some Liza Phase I contract for trees, which was subsea trees, which was for 17 trees. I guess that's more than we would have expected given flow rate of wells and high reservoir quality. Does that higher number indicate any kind of potential upsizing for Phase I FPSO beyond 120,000 barrels a day? Just any color on that, if you could.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes, Evan. I'd say it's probably a little bit too premature to talk about. I mean we are on, as you can appreciate, if we're getting close to an FID by the middle of this year, we're getting pretty close to fully defining the scope of the development, and there's still more work to be done, and we'll obviously share more of the specifics when we get to an FID decision. But right now, I really don't want to get into the specifics of the analysis that is actually underway.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thought I'd give it a try. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","All right.","Operator","And we will now hear from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Jeff. Jeff, could we go back to Mozambique if we could? I've obviously heard what you've been saying about it, but could you just clarify the development? I think Eni had talked about floating LNG. I assume, obviously, that you're leading an onshore effort means that presumably that's the direction that you're going to want to head in. Could you firstly just remind us why you bought into this reserve? Secondly, how you plan to develop it? Especially as we're aware that you're not involved in the existing project onshore? Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, well, the why is really because that we see it as a very competitive low cost to supply LNG source in the market. You think about some of the big greenfield developments that we've done historically and that we've participated in upfront in the development of Qatar and we're very proud of the role that we played in helping the state of Qatar to meet their overall objectives and has evolved into the world's leader in LNG. Papua New Guinea, another big greenfield development that has been extremely successful and is a key competitive source of LNG in the market and we see the same type of characteristics in Mozambique. And so that's why we see it as a very competitive LNG source.","In terms of what the plans are, remember that there was a floating LNG concept that was being progressed by the current co-venturers. It's called the Coral floating LNG, that is still intended to move forward. And then the most significant part of the Mozambique development would be an onshore development. As I said in my prepared comments, with anticipated capacity up to 40 million tons per annum for Area 4.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Is that going to be your own standalone development then, led by Exxon?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I'm sorry? The large...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","The onshore. Yes, the 40 million tons.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Let's be clear what's going on. So the actual ownership is by a Eni affiliate that we bought into. So the operator is Eni East Africa. The leadership will be provided by ExxonMobil on the onshore LNG facilities and Eni on the onshore facilities.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Forgive me. I looked at the financial annual that you put out recently in the Mozambique section. I can't see. Do you have an onshore position, land or site?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","It's being worked with the government concurrently.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So that's not yet the case, but it's underway. Understood. And what's the best guess, Jeff, for when this thing might actually be final investment decision and producing gas?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. I really have nothing to share with you at this point. I think what's important right now Paul is that we get the regulatory approvals and then working with the co-venturers to really optimize the development and we'll have a better handle on that once we get past those milestones.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah, good morning. I think it's going to be a LNG focus this morning given that Mozambique slide. Is there any change in LNG pricing approach, or I guess contracting approach? Obviously, Europe has got a big spot market that cargoes can be put into. Are you still thinking of the conventional way where you basically sign up Heads of Agreement and then contracts with long-term off-takers before launching an FID? The reason I ask is that there is a number of competing LNG schemes which will try and hit that 2023-2024 mismatch between supply and demand for LNG. So just trying to see how flexible you'll be to make sure these projects get in that first window.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes, Ed. It's a really good question. I mean, first point I'd make is given our success in Qatar and Papua New Guinea, I mean, we have built a tremendous amount of market credibility with the customers. We have an operational center that we set up in Singapore in order to provide the customers all the support they need. So I think the first message there is one of being able to go out and interface with the customers, meet their needs, but fundamentally, our objective will be to enter into long-term contracts that will underpin the investment. And the commercial structure of that continues to evolve. But I would tell you the commercial structure will be such that it will certainly underpin the substantial investments required for these LNG projects.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then on Guyana, more about timing. I mean, obviously you have your rig and it's going to be exciting to see how big Liza and then Payara could be with these appraisals. At the Analyst Day, you did walk through a number of other prospects that were being matured. I'm just wondering how many of those do you think would be drill-ready for when the rig is freed up in a few months on Payara, say, through the end of 2018? Wild guess.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. I mean, I'll tell you, Ed, this is job number one for our folks in exploration is making sure that they are staying well ahead of the rig, maturing the prospects to get them to a drillable stage. I'll just remind you that it's not only the Stabroek Block, but it's also Canje and Kaieteur that we're real-time integrating the 3-D seismic. We're taking the well results that we've got from the Stabroek Block program to date and we're real-time assessing the highest potential and they're staying, by definition, they're staying well ahead of the rig line.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Good luck with the drilling time of one month. That's going to be some fast work.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I'd tell you, I will say give some credit to the drillers and the wellsite team and the contractor. I mean, we have had just remarkable results on the program in Guyana.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now hear from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Jeff, good morning. I had two questions for you, maybe I can just ask both. The first is on Oil Sands. Many of your peers have been minimizing their footprint and I was just curious if you could comment on your appetite to maintain your existing position there.","And then the second, forgive me it's a little bit detailed, but on the buybacks, I see that you were just purchasing or repurchasing to offset dilution, but that number in the quarter struck me as fairly large, $500 million, where I think last year, you did just under $1 billion for the full year. So is there anything from a timing standpoint or one-off that kind of inflated that dilution in 1Q where we should think that to kind of normalize going forward? Thanks so much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, so on the Oil Sands, let me just step back a little bit and just remind everybody that we've been working on Oil Sands for over three decades now, and with that, we've maintained a very focused technology program. And I'd start off on the mining side with Kearl which was unique in its own right because of, we were able, through technology application, avoid the investment and the environmental footprint associated with an upgrader. And as we said during the analyst presentation, we have continued to work on the cost side and have substantially reduced the overall cost in that operation. So remember, long-lived assets, a long source of cash flow for us, and like we have always done with all of our assets, we will continue to be working towards enhancing the value of it.","On the oil sand side, our long history in Cold Lake, and then, looking at how we step the technology out further to not only enhance recovery but also lower cost and lower the environmental footprint. And we're looking at some new technology on SA-SAGD that we think will take us to that next step, but as you may recall, Blake, we've got a very large oil sands portfolio. And we like what we've got and we'll continue to look for ways to make it even more valuable in the future.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. And the buybacks, the dilution?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I'd tell you the buyback \u2013 I mean clearly, it varies over time. If you look over our history, there's variability with respect to that dilution, and it's fairly in line over a reasonable length of time. There's really nothing more I can share about it. I mean it's clearly defined as our intent to avoid dilution on our shareholders.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Maybe to follow up a little bit on Blake's question there on the share repos and guidance, not to do any more than offset dilution in Q2, you did outperform on cash flow in the quarter, especially with the lower CapEx. What should we be looking for or what do you think execs on the board are looking for in terms of the confidence? Is it oil prices, is it mostly just Exxon internally focused, a combo of the two? I'm just curious what would bring you back to that conference to buy back shares.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I mean, despite the macro volatility, which frankly, we have lived within for over 130 years, we're going to ensure that the business model is durable regardless. But it's then looking back about the value growth proposition that we've been able to put in place and how that has ultimately added back into further financial capability than what we currently have.","It's the same variables that we've discussed previously about how we decide whether to move forward with a buyback or not, and that decision is made on a quarterly basis. We'll consider things like the company's current financial position, our near-term CapEx requirements, our dividend requirements as well as the near-term business outlook. It's part of our capital allocation, Roger. The decision at this point will be one of deciding to put the cash to work either through buyback or reducing our debt load.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, you mentioned earlier the idea of a 15 rig target in the Delaware Basin, a spread between when we could expect that. What do you see as the main kind of levers that we should be watching to get pulled or need to see in the market to reach that target sooner or later?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, again, we'll be thinking about it from a long-term. We made a substantial acquisition, and that acquisition had assumed a certain amount of activity. And if we have true confidence in one, our business model, and two, our energy outlook, we'll go ahead and deliver on that activity level and ramp up. We see unique value that we're going to bring to that Permian acreage. And as we said back when we consummated the transaction, we believe that we're going to demonstrate that we are going to be industry-leading in terms of overall unit development cost and overall return on investment given the unique aspects of it and that being, as I said previously, the contiguous nature of it and the ability for us to bring our value chain perspective.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Sorry. Just if I could follow up real quick on that, the decision to expand the Downstream along the Gulf Coast, obviously, was tied into that, but is there a \u2013 in terms of the timing of developing the Delaware Basin, is some of the focus on supplying your Downstream? Or is that two separate items, two separate decisions?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","But I'd say on a macro level, it's one and the same. We're thinking about we participate across the full value chain. When you get into the specifics, I wouldn't necessarily say that they were connected.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next participant is Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, I just wanted to ask about how you see the role of the exploration program for the corporation currently. Many of your peers have really cut back activity levels and even your own spending has essentially fallen in half, at least in 2016 relative to where it had been in previous years, but you're also talking about fairly significant restocking of the portfolio that had some pretty clear success in Guyana. Is this an area where you see Exxon perhaps being able to distinguish itself from peers in the near-term?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. I mean the short answer is yes. I mean I would tell you that, as I said previously, a key aspect of the exploration program is to target resource opportunities that will upgrade \u2013 from a value perspective, upgrade our existing portfolio. I mean that is exactly what we're doing. We want the exploration folks to know that whatever they discover, the objective is that that gets to the top of our portfolio and brings unique value to the corporation.","Yes, we did slow down some of the exploration activities, but I'd say that we maintained a very healthy program in the down cycle. Last year, we shot the largest seismic acquisition program that we've done historically at a lower cost because of the market conditions. I think it was over 60,000 square kilometers of seismic in 2016. A very successful outcome.","And then, you think about the Guyana discovery, or discoveries, and the acreage capture that we've been able to pick up here in some really high potential unique opportunities. I think it really talks to how our exploration company and the organization how it has really contributed to not only the current but the future success of the corporation.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Appreciate that, Jeff. If I could just follow up a lot of what you're doing in exploration and indeed what you've added in Mozambique, is targeting deepwater areas. Is this a function of Exxon believing that deepwater can still be competitive if you have the right resource? Or is this really just a function of the opportunities that were available to you at the time?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, let me start, first, that our program is primarily focused in two key areas. The first one is high potential unexplored areas that, as I said a moment ago, that really compete with high grading the portfolio, like Guyana. And the second area is where we see material potential near existing infrastructure, like the Gulf of Mexico, like Canada East where we've picked up a lot of acreage by our Hebron and Hibernia facilities. So that is really what sets up the framework of our exploration program. And I would say that, as it relates to deepwater, that we do believe that given the right quality resource and given the progress that we have made on reducing the costs associated with our development programs, that we do see deepwater as being competitive.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's very helpful. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And we will now hear from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Jeff, two quick questions. First, the asset sale proceeds is about $700 million for the quarter. So can you share with us what's the asset sales gain and how that's split between different divisions?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. So as you said, it's just under $700 million in gross proceeds, and the earnings impact in the quarter was about $230 million, about half of it in Upstream and half in the Downstream.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And secondly then, you recently joined force with the Saudi on the Chemical to build a new Chemical site I think in Corpus Christi. In the U.S., given that you have such a commanding and well-established operation in Chemical, just curious that what's the rationale behind that you don't go ahead on your own and then you start using a joint venture structure given that it's always a little bit more challenging that when you're trying to manage a joint venture over time, so what exactly you expect that is going to bring to you that you decide not to go ahead and just do it on your own?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, I think it's a good question, Paul, and each one of these transactions are unique in their own right. We have a very long, well-established and successful partnership with SABIC, and this is something that in our broader business dealings both parties wanted to do and we saw that this was a good opportunity and a good means to achieving that. So as you know, the current expansion on ethylene capacity and corresponding polyethylene at Baytown and Mont Belvieu is 100% ExxonMobil, and as part of our long strategic relationship with SABIC, we decided to enter into a joint venture with them to pursue this possible steam cracker in the Gulf Coast.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Should we read that into that or maybe there's just too much that in the future expansion in the U.S., that would be the path that you take or that this is really just one-off?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I mean it will be dependent on the circumstances. I mean this one, as I said, there were strategic reasons for doing it. It made good sense. We had a very good long-established relationship in Saudi Arabia with SABIC, and we think this is the right thing to do. But I wouldn't read anything specific into it.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe just a couple follow-ups. One on Liza. As you get ready for FID, any high level thoughts you can share on drivers for the cost structure for the field, both specific drivers that are specific to Liza in terms of driving down a lower cost structure and then, maybe what you're seeing on a broader, specific things from the broader cost structure in terms of developing these types of projects, in terms of cost deflation, in terms of how we can think about potential costs of the project?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. I mean it's a good question when you think about the full scope of our development in Guyana, and clearly, the higher the resource density, the more profitable it's going to be, so I mean it starts with the resource, and then it goes to the focus on the design. And we really would like to get very much in the mode of designing one and building many, like we did in Angola, get in a routine of really working in optimal design, and then replicating that as you continue to expand resources through your exploration program.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And any thoughts in terms of the, I mean as you're close here, the cost deflation that you've seen across those types of product lines in terms of relative to where we were a few years ago?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I mean that's a specific focus area for us, and if you look back at our analyst presentation, if you look at a pool of projects that we've been working on, and from a development planning perspective and take us to current day on those projects, we've seen about a 30% cost reduction and that's through a lot of the development planning, the design work, the scope reduction or scope optimization that we've been doing. So a very substantial reduction over the last several years in terms of what we anticipate these assets are going to cost.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up. You've been active so far in asset acquisitions on everything ranging from international gas to domestic onshore oil. Any thoughts on where you're seeing greater value these days, international conventional style assets versus U.S. onshore and whether you continue to see a high level of interesting opportunities globally?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Ryan, I don't think I would focus on any one asset type or geography. As I have said previously, we will keep alert to opportunities around the globe, whether it be in the Upstream or the Downstream or Chemical business. And we'll evaluate those specific opportunities on their own merits. And remember, our objective here is, once again, to acquire assets that will compete with our existing portfolio and we're looking for opportunities that we can see accretive value to. So I mean that's how I would characterize it, but we've had a number of transactions, as you're aware of, and we keep our eyes open and I think that's another indication of the strength of the corporation, that we've got the financial flexibility to pursue those opportunities when they come up.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Welcome.","Operator","And we will now hear from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Yeah, hi. Morning, Jeff. Just a couple of follow-up questions actually. Firstly, just a comment on sort of your investment plans. I think you talked about 2017, including Mozambique. I was just wondering when you look at the guidance from the Analyst Day for 2018 to 2020, and the $70 billion to $80 billion there, I was just wondering how much in there is sort of assumed inorganic spend?","And then the second question, I think characteristic of these results, the Q1 has been sort of the lower operating expense from Exxon across multiple businesses. I was just wondering how much more do you think there is to go from an internal perspective through 2017, 2018. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah. Well, Theepan, I guess the first point I'd make on the investment program is that if it was not already in progress, there's really nothing in the forward investment plan. It goes back to my last comment that we've got that financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions if we think they are value accretive. So there's nothing really I can highlight for you on the forward 2018 to 2020 investment program that we shared in the analyst presentation.","Looking at our cost structure, the first thing I would say is that I'm always very much amazed with the success the organization is able to achieve with finding more innovative solutions. And I want to be really clear. This is not just squeezing the margins on the service sector. This is working with the service sector to find lower cost innovative alternatives to allow for this work to get done. And I think that relationship, that collaboration has been a key to success that we've been able to achieve.","I will tell you that, from our perspective, we believe we're never done on driving that cost structure. We continue, as I said, the organization continues to identify new opportunities to lower that cost structure while maintaining and enhancing operational integrity. So I'm not going to put a specific target out there, but the role of the organization is one to really identify and capture the lowest lifecycle cost. And it starts with the exploration program. It goes into our development program getting the lower unit development costs, and then it goes into the production organization to find ways to drive that cost structure down.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Okay. Great Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Iain Reid with Macquarie.","Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.","Yeah. Hi, Jeff. Couple of questions from me. Just firstly kind of philosophically, it looks like Exxon is at the sort of level in terms of oil and gas prices where your free cash flow is pretty much equivalent to your dividend. So I just wonder how that makes Exxon management's feel about maybe accelerating the pace of growth in terms of potentially more acquisitions or spending a bit more in terms of CapEx? And just is this the kind of level at which we can see somewhat of an inflection in terms of the pace of Exxon's investment plans? And I've got a follow-up after that.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yes. Iain, I guess the first point I'd make is that, as I said, our free cash flow is $4.4 billion, our dividend is $3.1 billion, so we had excess of $1.3 billion. And then, to remind you that we also funded this escrow account for the InterOil transaction of $1.7 billion. So round number is about $3 billion excess cash. And I think, again, it really speaks to the effectiveness of our business model.","Now, going back to the point around the pace of our investment program, that pace is going to be driven by value optimization. It is going to be driven by our ability to get our portfolio to a place where we think we have the optimal value, and we're ready to move forward. And it's not a constraint by the balance sheet or the amount of cash that we're generating at this point, but to be transparent, I mean we do step back and we look at the macro and look at the near-term period to make sure that we retain that financial flexibility.","But we're not going to forego opportunities. If we think that we see one in terms of additional acreage to pick up or an acquisition or a unique opportunity to go ahead and progress investments in a lower cost structure or in other arrangements, then, we're going to proceed with it and we've got that capability to move when it's appropriate.","Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.","Yeah. And that kind of brings me on to my second question. You've used your shares for two of the kind of major transactions which you've completed in the quarter, or at least announced in the quarter. That seems to me a very obvious thing to do given the rate in which your shares trade on certainly relative to your peers.","I wonder is that your kind of favored method of transacting when you're buying assets. What advantage do you think that gives you over using cash? And in terms of this dilution which you talked about earlier about buying back the dilution, do you intend, as a kind of priority, to buy back the dilution which you're creating by using your shares as an acquisition currency?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","There's a couple elements in that. The first point I'd make is that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of that transaction will be a function of the dialogue between buyer and seller. And as you know, over the last three transactions, one was cash, two were stock, but we've got the capability to do either and I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of a preferred approach.","The second point is on dilution. Since the merger of Exxon and Mobil around 2000, we have bought back about 40% of outstanding shares. So it's a tremendous progress when you think about it over the years, and that is one of the things that we believe is a tax efficient way to distribute excess cash to our shareholders.","Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome, Iain.","Operator","And we will now hear from Anish Kapadia with TPH.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi, Jeff. My first question is just thinking back over the last few years. It doesn't seem like you FID'd a major Upstream project in the last three years through the down cycle. And I suppose you haven't seen the countercyclical investment coming through from Exxon that maybe some would have expected. Can you just talk about what's kind of the reasons behind the lack of FIDs over the last few years? Was it waiting for costs to come down? Is it the project queue that you've got? And how could that change going forward?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, Anish, I mean the first point just to make sure everybody understands that in 2016, we did have six FIDs. We had two in the Upstream, two in the Downstream and two in the Chemical. Probably, the biggest one in the Upstream was the Tengiz expansion. We have announced two FIDs in 2017 both in the Downstream at this point.","I would tell you that there were several factors that play into the pace of our FIDs, one, obviously, being the ability to make sure that we're comfortable, that we've gotten all the value out of the opportunity, particularly when you're in a down cycle, there are opportunities to step back and look at are there other ways now in the current business climate that we can go ahead and generate more value from it. And we've done exactly that.","As I said a moment ago, over the last several years, the projects that have been closer to FIDs, we've been able to get about 30% out of the cost. So it's a very keen sense of have we fully optimized the value proposition for these investments. When we get to that point, we've got the financial flexibility to move forward, and we want to make sure that these investments, as we always have historically, are durable in a low price environment. And I think that will really set the pace going forward.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","And to follow up, maybe just drilling down a little bit more into that, specifically, in West Africa. When I look at Nigeria, there's been a number of projects that you've had on books for a long time in that pre-FID category that don't seem to have made much progress. I think in your latest Financial and Operating Review, we've seen some projects disappear out like the Uge development. I think the Satellite Fields Development capacity has been cut down. So I'm just wondering in terms of Nigeria, is it the cost that's still a problem? Is it the politics? I just wanted to get a little bit of an update on how things are going there.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I mean, you're really touching on another element of pace, and that is making sure that we've got certain stability within our commercial structure, and that all the partners have the capability to go move forward and fund these projects. But just to make sure the record is clear, over the last five years, we have had four startups, Erha North Phase 2s, the Satellite Fields Development Phase 1, Usan, so we've had a number of startups. There are a number, as you point out appropriately, they are on the development planning exercise, and that'll be a function of some of these variables locking up. We need to make sure that we've got a \u2013 not only have we optimized the design, but that the co-venturers are all ready to move forward and that we have a very clear view of the fiscal stability.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next participant is Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. A quick one about Guyana. Given that you're going to be one of the very few operators anywhere in the world to reach FID in 2017, can you just talk directionally about how the supplier contracting process has been as you've been approaching project sanction in terms of cost, competitiveness, et cetera?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, Pavel, as I've talked to, we work very closely with our contractors, our service providers, to identify win-win outcomes to ensure that we've got the optimal development scope defined and that has continued to work extremely well. I think everybody is really excited about the opportunity in Guyana and I think there's a lot of enthusiasm moving forward, and with that comes a lot of good thoughts and innovation. So specifically, in terms of cost, I'd only point to the progress that we've made that we shared at the analyst presentation that we've reduced the cost structure by about 30% in the suite of projects that we're progressing.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, just a quick housekeeping item about African liquids. That was the steepest decline in your portfolio year-over-year in Q1 down 25%. Is that Nigerian disruptions or other culprits behind that?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, I think you're referring to, I guess, both sequentially and quarter-on-quarter. It was due to entitlements and downtime.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Any particular country?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, I mean entitlements, they're all PSC, and in the downtime, it's primarily in Nigeria.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Clear enough. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. We will hear from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah, yes, thank you. Jeff, in terms of your short cycle activity, the industry is obviously ramping up creatively. You're now more exposed in the Permian. What are you seeing in terms of cost inflation for the kind of projects you're pursuing for the short cycle time? And is it something that you feel you'll be able to manage effectively?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Yeah, good morning, John. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, that the inflationary pressures that we've seen year-to-date are really fully offset by the efficiencies we've been able to capture. Clearly, as the activity picks up, there are going to be some cost pressures, but I can tell you that the organization is very focused on making sure that we drive those costs down. And I'll refer you to a couple of presentations that we've shown on that. The last one being in the analyst presentation where we showed the Permian cost reduction we've been able to achieve over the last couple years of about 46% on our field and 72% on the development cost, and we fully expect that the organization is going to continue to find ways to offset any type of cost pressures.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. Thanks. That's it for me.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","I think the only other point I'd add to you, John, is that as you see activity pick up, the key will be also maintaining really strong efficiency and execution, so.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Agreed.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.","Well, to conclude, again, I'd like to thank you for your time and the very thoughtful questions this morning. And I want to say that we do appreciate the trust our shareholders place in ExxonMobil, and we look forward to talking to you all in the future. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes the call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. ","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. ","Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth slowed in the first quarter, primarily due to continued contraction in the European Union. The U.S. and Japanese economies are also expected to show declines from fourth quarter levels. China growth, while still robust, was also lower in the first quarter. ","Energy markets were mixed in the first quarter, with higher crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices. Industry refining margins also improved from the fourth quarter. While U.S. chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia continued at near bottom-of-cycle conditions. ","Turning now to the first quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings, excluding special items, were $9.5 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 49%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $2, down $0.14 from a year ago. ","Corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. ","Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Through the end of the first quarter 2012, we have repurchased the number of shares issued for XTO, and total shares outstanding are now lower than they were prior to the acquisition. ","Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share, a 21% increase from the last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 million in the second quarter of 2012, unchanged from last quarter. CapEx in the first quarter was $8.8 billion, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011. ","Across our diverse portfolio, we continued to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products while supporting economic growth, including job creation. Our cash generation remains strong, $21.8 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, cash totaled $19.1 billion and debt was $15.7 billion. ","The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $13.1 billion to $19.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with asset sales which have not yet closed and therefore are not yet reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, lower working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $21.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E, $7.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash by $0.8 billion. ","Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings of $9.5 billion decreased $1.2 billion or 11% from the first quarter of 2011. Upstream earnings decreased $873 million, while downstream earnings improved by $487 million. Chemical earnings were down $815 million. ","Corporate and financing expenses were flat. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter. As shown on Slide 7, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 8. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high-quality projects. The Kearl Initial Development project is now 90% complete and is on schedule to start up later this year, with initial gross production of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. The initial fleet of haul trucks and shovels are on site and assembled, and all pipelines are mechanically complete. ","In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites project remains on schedule for a mid-2012 startup, with peak capacity of 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The development design will optimize the capabilities of existing facilities, allowing for increased production levels without the investment in an additional floating production, storage and offloading vessel. Onshore fabrication is complete, while FPSO modifications and subsea pipeline installation are expected to finish in the second quarter. ","In Nigeria, we completed construction of 3 wellhead platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellites project. The structures are currently being moved to the field site for installation. These are the first offshore platform structures to be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start up in late 2012, with peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day. Also in Nigeria, the Usan deepwater development achieved first oil in February and has a production capacity of 180,000 gross barrels per day. ","In Russia, construction is complete on the Arkutun-Dagi gravity-based structure, with float-out scheduled for later this year. The project remains on schedule for startup in 2014. ","In March, ExxonMobil, along with our partners, finalized the settlement agreement with the state of Alaska regarding the Point Thomson unit, which enables the progression of the initial development phase of the Point Thomson project. The settlement agreement sets out the near-term development plan for the Point Thomson field. The initial production system will include processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 10,000 barrels of condensate per day. ","Detailed engineering and purchasing of long lead equipment is currently underway. Pending approval of the draft environmental impact statement and other required permits, startup of the initial phase at Point Thomson is anticipated in the first quarter of 2016. Alaska's North Slope holds more than 35 trillion cubic feet of discovered natural gas, and Point Thomson is a key component to the development of this resource. ","Turning now to Slide 9. We continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation with Rosneft. Earlier this month, Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed a series of agreements to implement the long-term Strategic Cooperation Agreement that our companies announced last August. The execution of these foundation agreements for our joint venture with Rosneft establishes the key terms for our cooperative exploration and development of the Kara Sea and the Black Sea. ","President-elect Putin also recently announced fiscal terms to encourage offshore development in Russia. These improved terms eliminate the export tax and lower the mineral extraction tax. Fiscal terms will be fixed at 15 years for the Kara Sea and 10 years for the Black Sea deepwater. ","In addition, we commenced joint exploration activities in the Black Sea. Our seismic acquisition is now nearing completion. We are also planning for seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea for later this year. We expect to begin exploration drilling in the 2014 to 2015 time frame as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted. ","Additionally, Rosneft will take equity in promising exploration and development projects in the United States and Canada, including the La Escalera Ranch project in the Delaware Basin in West Texas and equity in the Harmattan acreage in the Cardium play of the western Canada basin in Alberta. Rosneft also has the opportunity to acquire a 30% interest in 20 blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Rosneft and ExxonMobil will jointly study tight oil production technologies in western Siberia. ","Turning now to deepwater exploration on Slide 10. ExxonMobil maintains a diverse and robust global deepwater portfolio which supports an active drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, exploiting opportunities in proven basins and drilling near-field wildcats. For example, in Romania, we drilled a successful deepwater play test on the Neptune block in the Black Sea with the Deepwater Champion drillship. Following this encouraging play test, we are planning additional 3-D seismic data acquisition to support future drilling opportunities on the block. ","We also participated in an exploration well offshore Tanzania in the first quarter, which discovered approximately 5 TCF of recoverable gas in a high-quality reservoir. A second exploration well is planned for second quarter 2012 to test another prospect on the block. ","We also maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program as discussed on Slide 11. In North America, we hold a material position in multiple unconventional plays across 8 million acres, and we continue to increase our lease holdings in emerging liquids-rich plays, like the Woodford Ardmore. Our acreage position in the Woodford Ardmore play tripled in 2011 to more than 170,000 acres, with acquisition costs on a per-acre basis roughly 50% below major industry acquisitions in the Eagle Ford play. ","In the first quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 58,000 acres through a strategic acquisition, which will increase our total acreage position to more than 230,000 acres. This will further expand our position in a play where we already hold 170,000 net acres, with an estimated potential to recover 600 million oil equivalent barrels at an attractive unit development cost of approximately $10 per barrel. We continue to focus drilling activity to maximize the development of this liquids-rich play with 10 operated rigs. Current drilling is focused on delineating the acreage, as well as determining optimal well spacing and drilling and completion practices. ","We also hold a large heritage position in tight oil plays in western Canada, including the Cardium and Viking plays. We are actively drilling in the Cardium and achieved first oil production in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are currently drilling in the Viking and have additional drilling planned this year to further delineate this tight oil resource. ","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 12. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, down $873 million from the first quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas realizations increased earnings by approximately $1.3 billion, as  crude oil realizations increased by more than $13 a barrel, and non-U.S. average gas realizations increased $1.27 per thousand cubic feet. ","However, positive effects resulting from the increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. The decrease in U.S. natural gas realizations of $1.25 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by more than $300 million. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $850 million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, base decline and divestments, partly offset by the ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects. ","Earnings were also negatively impacted by the unfavorable timing of liftings, as we were underlifted in higher-margin areas, such as the North Sea and West Africa. All other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments, combined with higher exploration and operating expenses, decreased earnings by $1 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the first quarter of 2012 were $18.83, reflecting the unfavorable mix impacts and higher effective tax rate. ","Moving to Slide 13. Oil equivalent volumes decreased by more than 5% from the first quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in Angola and Iraq and less downtime. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down about 1%. ","Turning now to Slide 14. First quarter operational performance was consistent with plans, including the successful startup of the Nigeria Usan development. Additional project startups expected in the second half of the year, including Angola Satellites, Nigeria Satellites and the Kearl Initial Development project, are key to achieving our 2012 volumes outlook. Although seasonal factors, including demand and the timing of planned maintenance activities, will impact volume profiles during the year, we expect full year volume performance to be consistent with our March outlook. ","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 15. Upstream earnings decreased by $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil realizations and non-U.S. natural gas realizations positively impacted earnings by more than $300 million, as crude oil realizations increased by more than $7 per barrel and non-U.S. average gas realizations increased $0.26 per thousand cubic feet. ","However, positive effects resulting from the increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. A decrease in U.S. natural gas realizations of $0.70 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by $170 million. Production and mix effects, mainly higher natural gas volumes from stronger seasonal demand in Europe, increased earnings by $100 million. Earnings were negatively impacted, however, by the unfavorable timing of liftings as we were underlifted in higher-margin West Africa. Other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments, decreased earnings by more than $1.2 billion. ","Moving to Slide 16. Oil equivalent volumes were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011 as the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa and divestments were more than offset by stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up almost 3%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement. ","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 17. Downstream earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion, up $487 million from the first quarter of 2011. Margin effects decreased earnings by $40 million. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed to the positive $210 million in volume and mix effects. Other factors, primarily higher gains on asset sales, increased earnings by $320 million. ","Moving to Slide 18. Sequentially, first quarter Downstream earnings increased by $1.2 billion. Improved industry refining margins contributed increased earnings of $840 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70 million. Other factors increased earnings by $390 million, largely due to higher gains on asset sales and favorable foreign exchange effects. ","Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 19. First quarter Chemical earnings were $701 million, a decrease of $815 million versus the first quarter of 2011. Lower margins decreased earnings by $520 million, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, while volumes and mix effects were flat. Other factors decreased earnings by $300 million, reflecting higher planned maintenance expense and the absence of favorable tax items. ","Moving to Slide 20.  Sequentially, first quarter Chemical earnings increased by $158 million, driven by stronger demand for specialty products. Margin effects increased earnings by $50 million. Volume and mix increased earnings by $60 million, while all other items increased earnings a total of $50 million. While the first quarter continued to show cyclical weakness in Europe and Asia margins, ExxonMobil continues to leverage feed advantage, integration, cost discipline and premium product offerings to strongly position us throughout the Chemical business cycle. ","Moving to Slide 21. ExxonMobil's first quarter financial and operating performance was strong. It reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ","That concludes my prepared remarks this morning. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question's on the big increase in the dividend. And specifically, at the analyst meeting, Rex seemed pretty clear that a more balanced approach to distributions might be forthcoming. But on this point, the size of the increase represents a fairly marked departure from the 6% to 7% annualized growth rate you guys have provided over 5, 10, and I think, even 15 years. So my question's whether or not you could provide some color on this change and specifically, how we should consider it in the context of overall dividend policy at ExxonMobil.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Doug, that's an excellent question given our announcement yesterday. Let me kind of start with your last comment and move backwards from there. We really had no change in our dividend policy. The policy remains the same, as does our total allocation of cash generated by the business. We do have a continued trend in dividend increases as we have said before. If you go back over a long history of the company, we have, in other quarters, had fairly significant dividend increases. So again, no change in policy. But as we said at the analyst meeting, we are always evaluating the dividend policy and our cash distributions and studying how things are going. And the board decided yesterday to make the increase they did. But you also notice that our share repurchases remained at the $5 billion level that you saw across last year. So I would say the strategy remains the same, invest in that very robust investment program we have, and you saw our first quarter CapEx, very strong as those projects proceed, have a continuously growing dividend and then take the balance of the cash and buy the shares. And that policy and strategy, I think, continues on.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And let me just ask you one more question. There's been a lot of crosscurrents about the position in Iraq and specifically Exxon's current license, the strategy in Kurdistan and eligibility and\/or interest on the upcoming licensing round. And so could you provide an update on that position, which covers these items, to the degree possible, David?","David S. Rosenthal","I really can't comment a lot on that other than just say the contracts that we have in place and it's our intent to honor and fulfill those contractual obligations. I will note in the South, we reached another milestone at West Qurna, where production has reached right at 400,000 barrels a day, and we're very pleased how that effort is coming along and the progress we're making there. We continue to develop the field and do the things that we committed to do, and so progress continues. But other than that, I really wouldn't have any further comments.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple, also, if I may. You mentioned on your prepared remarks about the higher E&P tax rate. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color as to why that was, if it was just mix effects and what the driver was. And in the context of the same issue, you also mentioned underlifts in the international portfolio. It's unusual for you to mention that, I guess. To the extent that it was material, could you quantify that for us, either absolute or on a per barrel basis?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, I'd be happy to do -- answer both of those, Doug. First of all, I'll start with the tax rate. You got the right word. You said mix. We have -- and it's a number of mix effects that we saw across the first quarter. One of those that kind of goes unmentioned is really the difference in a lot of the crude prices around the world. People tend to focus in on Brent and WTI. There was a lot of variability. For example, the Middle East crudes tended to do better than those markers. Some of the Canadian crudes, particularly the heavier crudes, tended to do less. You also have different fiscal regimes in each of these countries. And frankly, we saw some of the highest realization increases in countries with higher tax rates and some of the lower-than-average increases or even decreases in countries with lower tax rates. So the mix -- that mix there and then the corresponding mix of where your earnings were generated that uptick in this quarter on the tax rate. Let me talk about the underlifts. They were a factor this quarter, so maybe I'll go ahead and give some specifics here. In the first quarter of 2012, on a absolute basis, we were underlifted about 45,000 barrels a day. Last year, in the first quarter we were actually overlifted by about 18,000 barrels a day, though the delta quarter-on-quarter was about 63,000 barrels a day. All of that underlift was in either West Africa or the North Sea, which tend to be some of our higher-margin areas. The impact was actually, quarter-on-quarter, a little bit bigger sequentially, so let me provide those numbers to you. Again, on an absolute basis, we were 45,000 barrels a day underlifted in the first quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, we were actually overlifted about 37,000 barrels a day. You might recall across last year, we talked about kind of quarter-to-quarter, we were a little underlifted and we made a bunch of that up at the end of the year. So if you take the 45,000, we were underlifted in the first quarter and the 37,000 we were overlifted in the fourth quarter. Sequentially, we were down about 82,000 barrels a day. And again, all of that was in West Africa. So it's a bit unusual that you have that level of a lifting timing effect, but it did occur in the first quarter. And as you would guess by doing the math, did have an impact on our reported earnings.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","David, would you be able to quantify the net income impact? Or is that not something you want to get into?","David S. Rosenthal","No, I don't have the net income effect on that. But again, as I mentioned, those are some of our higher-margin barrels, and you can probably use your own estimates and come up with a number. But I don't have one for you today.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Congratulations again on the Rosneft exploration JV. I wanted to go back to that for a minute. Your recent presentation and that of Rosneft highlighted or focused extensively on the oil prospectivity of the Kara Sea. So what about gas? By that, I mean estimates from, say, the USGS and others place more discoverable gas potential in the area than oil. To the extent that you discover natural gas, do the agreements contemplate and does the fiscal structure allow for economic development of the gas?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, that's an excellent question, and I'm glad you highlighted, to begin with, the progress we made because we really have made substantial progress. I think in the meeting we had last week, the term historic was actually used, and so we're very pleased as are our partners in Rosneft with the progress that we've made. I know there's a number of estimates out there in terms of the prospectivity in the Kara Sea. I think I've seen some different ones, the one you've mentioned. I think WoodMac has some numbers out there. Clearly, there's oil and gas potential out there. I don't think we know yet how to assess that, and really, that process is just getting underway. I really, in terms, so -- but again, as we said at the meeting, we are highly encouraged by the prospectivity on the oil side because of the extension of the prolific West Siberia basin plays that are already in existence and are already producing, so that's what kind of lends  that. Looking forward, it's really premature to start discussing the contract details or arrangements or fiscal terms and that sort of stuff in detail. I would just point out, again, for those on the call that aren't as familiar, the Kara -- our position in the Kara Sea is equivalent in size to basically the North Sea and all of the leased acreage in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, a huge area of land, over 30 million acres, highly prospective. But again, under some rather harsh conditions, a challenging environment to work in and will require all of the technological and operational capabilities of the 2 partners to explore that resource and should it be successful, to then exploit those resources and move forward with development and production. We have a lot of experience in the Arctic, even in Russia. And again, if you just kind of look at the parameters and the vectors, we're encouraged by the progress. We're certainly excited and looking forward to the joint venture, as are our partners and in particular, as I mentioned, getting the seismic activity underway and preparing to drill our first wells here in the next 2 to 3 years.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","The scenario that was presented in terms of potential FID date and potential first production, both of those were presuming this was an oil discovery that would be made. Is that right?","David S. Rosenthal","I think that's generally correct. Again, though, I would just caution on looking forward. There's a lot of work to do, a lot of effort to be done here, and so I don't want to really start getting into specifics about FID dates and production and that sort of thing other than to say the schedule that we have in front of us, which is really getting that seismic underway this year, developing that drillable prospect inventory, siting that first well and getting that well done in what industry perspective-wise would be a fairly short time frame. So again, we're going after it aggressively. But this is true frontier exploration, and we'll certainly be disciplined and diligent in our approach. And, again, it is early days, so I think we'll focus a little more on the prospectivity and potential and a little less on what some of those specific dates might be in the outer years.","Operator","Morgan Stanley's Evan Calio has our next questions.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question on Kearl. I appreciate your comments and then progress update. I know you guys have secured a transportation solution, but can you provide more color on the planned route to market so we can better understand potential relative realizations versus waterborne crudes? I know you mentioned earlier they're -- they've been quite lower than others.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, if we're thinking about the initial phase, the first phase that's coming on this year, I can tell you we already have placement for that first page -- first phase, I'm sorry, so it's not an issue. We have multiple options within our own refining circuit to begin with, as well as some other options. But basically, we're looking to place those first barrels with existing infrastructure and routes. And again, the bulk of that will likely find its way within our own system, but we have some other options. I think what's important to know is that we can start up Kearl, take it up to its full initial production of 110,000 barrels a day without any concerns over logistical constraints.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. And secondly, on Argentina, I mean, have your plans, pace of activity or thoughts changed at all in Argentina following the YPF nationalization? I know you have almost a 900,000-acre position and curious to see how you're thinking or kind of accounting for any potential investment risk there.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me start out by saying that our position, ExxonMobil and our activity down there has not been affected by some of the recent activities that you mentioned that have occurred down there. Our activity, our exploration activity, is continuing. In fact, I can tell you in the first quarter, we did complete our first 2 wells and get those down. We're in the process here in the second quarter of frac-ing those wells, and we'll be testing them in the second quarter, so those plans continue, and the objectives are being met. As you mentioned, we have a very large acreage position there. We're encouraged by the early results that we're seeing down there and look forward to profitably moving on with that venture. Having said that, of course, we are monitoring events that are occurring down there and what's happening, and we'll take all of that into consideration. But as we sit here today, we're meeting the objectives we set for the year, and plans are continuing. And again, we have a very long, successful history in Argentina and going forward, got a great set of acreage down there. And again, we continue to work on that per our plan coming into the year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Have you had [ph] contact with the government and have some confirmation? Or is there any update on dialogue going there of your importance to the development of that resource?","David S. Rosenthal","I don't have anything specific to identify. Obviously, in any country where we have a lot of activity going on and investments, we're always in contact, in dialogue with the appropriate government agencies, as well as our partners. So I wouldn't look for anything specific out of any meetings or contacts. Those are ongoing just as they always have been, but wouldn't have any specifics to offer other than normal conversations that go on as we continue to really look at what we have down there and put together our plans and move forward.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, a couple of questions regarding North America gas potential. ExxonMobil has a successful and large global petrochemicals business, global LNG business. The petrochemicals is focused on Asia and some in the Middle East growth. Can you comment on whether you see your now large domestic gas position as creating opportunities on both the export of LNG from the U.S. or potentially the western Canada and\/or coming back to the U.S. in terms of some of the petrochemical expansions which you guys have otherwise focused on in the rest of the world? Do you see that as more of an opportunity going forward for you? And\/or how do you plan to take advantage of that?","David S. Rosenthal","Arjun, that's a good question. And of course, behind that, it all starts with some of the obvious competitive advantages that we have across the entire space that you covered: our large prolific gas acreage that we have in the U.S., the advantages we have certainly and have already demonstrated and you're seeing in our U.S.-based Chemical business and of course, our global position in LNG. So given that competitive advantage background, I think -- don't think it'll come as any surprise to you that we're studying and assessing the very opportunities that you referred to. I don't have any specifics to offer you, again, other than to say we do have some advantages from all the way through the integration of resources in the products. And as we're always doing, we're thinking about how to optimally develop those, take advantage of the acreage position we have, the resource potential we have, the technology, the marketing advantages, et cetera, to, again, on an integrated basis, exploit those resources. So any ideas you have and are thinking about and the things you read others are doing, you can rest assured we got folks looking at that and studying that as well.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe just a related question, can you talk about any update on your activities in the Marcellus and Utica, as well as the Bakken in terms of maybe how the rig counts are trending and what you're expected to do here over the rest of this year?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, I'd be happy to. Let me start with the Bakken and back up a little bit because that is an area where we have been, over the last many months, increasing rigs, and we have continued to increase our rigs. We're now -- we've now got 8 operated rigs running in the Bakken. And that is progressing very well, and we are encouraged by that. In the Marcellus, we've got 5 rigs operating. And as you -- well, actually, we got 4 rigs operating. And as you know, we've got just under 700,000 acres in the Marcellus and another 87,000 in the Utica, and so we continue to progress there. But I can tell you, overall, when you're looking at our rig count and what we're doing, I think it's important to kind of step back and think about what we're doing overall. You might recall across most of last year or so, we tended to have, I recall, 70, 72 rigs running in total. We've got about 64 on average in the first quarter. We're running 61 rigs today, and we have continued to shift those to the liquids-rich plays that I mentioned, really focusing on the Bakken, Permian, the Ardmore that I mentioned there. We're looking at and getting ready to plan some wells, get some wells down in the Utica, so all of that's going well and, again, continuing to acquire liquids-rich acreage at attractive prices and shift our rig fleet over to those areas while minimizing the incremental exposure to dry gas wells.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can I come back on the production in Africa? You talked about the underlift. But if you add that back, you're still going to face substantial fall from the first quarter of last year in your African production, and I think you said PSC effects. You've been through some threshold effects. Is that right to say that, that, the kind of 50,000, 60,000 barrel a day decline x the underlifts is due to threshold effects, profit all or cost all?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, let me come at it a different way, and remember, the production that we list is the production, and the underlift is really just the sale. So if you come back to the -- just the Africa production decline that you saw in the supplement between the first quarter of last year and the first quarter this year, the bulk of that is accounted for by the entitlement effects that I mentioned, mostly the pricing spend but a little on the net interest side. Everything else kind of washed out.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So this is production, not liftings?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, what we show you -- let me clarify that. What we show you in the supplement, that's a production number. And again, we had some project ramp-up that I mentioned, and we also had some better downtime performance, I'm pleased to say. And then that was basically offset mostly by declines, so the impact you're seeing there really is the impact of higher prices on our entitlement volumes.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Are we talking about Angola mainly here and some -- is it possible to say which fields, Blocks 15 or 17?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, I mean , a lot of it's Angola, but it's also Nigeria and some other places and then, of course, our large producing operations there, our Blocks 15 and 17.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just thinking more generally about second quarter production. You've got some maintenance, I believe, in Angola coming up. Maybe a little bit of field ramp-up, but it was kind of past flow [ph]. Are we looking generally around the same sort of level of production in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","I really don't have any guidance to give you on second quarter production, no real specific events. We do see the projects continuing to ramp up a bit, but I really don't have a real forward outlook for you.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, David, could I just ask one more? You mentioned a couple of times asset sales affecting earnings, and yet there's nothing in the special items here. Is it possible you could tell us what the absolute asset sales was in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year in terms of the impact on earnings?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure,  if you look at across the total corporation, as we mentioned in the press release, the absolute earnings associated with asset sales in the first quarter of '12 was about $400 million, and that was generally all in the Downstream. If you look compared to the first quarter of 2011, the number was about the same, about $500 million. But there, the bulk of that was in the Upstream, so you had kind of a switch there. The key variance that you see in our sequential earnings, as we go from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the total earnings from asset sales in the fourth quarter last year were about $1.4 billion, about $1.1 billion of that in the Upstream and about $300 million of that in the Downstream. So the big sequential impact you see is in the Upstream, and that's really the absence of that significant divestment that we had last quarter. I'd also mention -- yes, let me just mention, just to be clear, in the Downstream, the asset sales that we had in the first quarter related to the previously announced divestments in Malaysia and Central America. We have not booked anything in Japan. As we mentioned last quarter, that'll be later in the year.","Operator","And now we'll open the floor up to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could, I was looking at your cash flow statement. On the working capital and other is a positive swing of $6 billion. That seems to be a big number even for the size of Exxon. Is that related to the timing of taxes payment or anything like that? Or would that -- maybe my question is that, should we assume that, that is here to stay or that at some point in the later year, it's going to get reversed?  The...","David S. Rosenthal","Let me answer that one first, Paul, and then I'll let you go to the second question. That's actually very straightforward. During the first quarter, that we saw a big decrease in working capital, and that was literally all due to higher payables. We have some other ins and outs, but the real net effect you're seeing there is a fairly decent increase in our payables counts.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You said related to crude purchase?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, that's related primarily to crude purchases, and of course, that's price-driven, as you saw the prices ramp up across the quarter such that when you got to the end of the quarter, you had some pretty high prices. But, again, nothing really out of the ordinary, if you look at the quarter and you look at what prices did. But I'm glad you asked the question because that is the impact you're seeing there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. In Woodford Ardmore, what is your current production? I know you normally that don't want to go down there to too much granularity in terms of what is the well production run rate, that kind of thing. But can you also tell us then what is the split between, say, the black oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas in that play and if there's any rough estimate on your 30-day IP that you've been seeing on those?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Paul, I'll be consistent with your expectations and just say no. I'm not prepared to give that level of detail today. I think what's important is not necessarily the actual production that we're generating there. What's real important is the effort we have underway now to delineate that acreage, to analyze what we have and really put together that comprehensive, long-term exploitation and development plan that we have, and that's what we'll deliver: the volumes and the rates and the earnings down the road. But as we sit here today, I think what's important, we're adding acreage. It's very attractive acreage. If you had a jigsaw puzzle of that area, you'd see that the things we're adding are plugging right in to adjacent properties that we already have. So the acreage position I mentioned isn't just an acreage position.  It's a mostly contiguous acreage position, which, as you would guess, gives us really good opportunities to optimize around the development. So we are seeing nice increases in production as the wells are coming onstream, and we're encouraged by those results. But our focus is less on what today's production is. We're getting the rigs down there. I think I mentioned we added 2 more rigs this quarter to the Ardmore, so we've now got 10 running, and we're working on that area. And as the actual production goes into sales later on, we'll be in a better position to give more information.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and if I sneak in a quick question?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Poland, how many additional well do you plan to drill this year?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, if you take a look at our Polish position, I think I mentioned last quarter, the wells that we had drilled and how those turned out, I'll tell you that during the first quarter of this year, we did acquire a fourth 3-D seismic activity. The processing of that seismic is ongoing, and the analysis we get out of that compared with the learnings we got from the wells that we drilled will really give us kind of an all-inclusive set of results that we can evaluate and then plan our go-forward plan. But I got to tell you, the go-forward plan is really dependent on the 3-D seismic and again, the real geoscience evaluations that we'll do are really going to drive our future plans, and those just aren't set just yet.","Operator","And now we'll move on to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to go back, if I could, on 2 issues that you covered previously: one being the dividend; and the second, Russia. On the dividend, if I look historically, it's around this time of year that you -- the board basically sets a policy for the year. Is it fair to think that the dividend will remain at this level for the balance of the year? Or do you think that we have an opportunity to re-evaluate and potentially increase further in a later quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Blake, that's a good question, but I really don't have a comment or wouldn't want to try to speculate or forecast what we might do going forward. I think, again, we did raise the dividend yesterday by 21%. Policy is unchanged, if look from a macro perspective. But I really wouldn't want to try to speculate or forecast anything on a go-forward basis.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. The question on Russia, I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you arrived at the North American assets to contribute to the JV. When you look at Exxon's portfolio in the U.S., obviously, you've got quite a few options. I'm just curious on the Cardium and Delaware, I mean, was it just similar geologic characteristics? Or was it more financially motivated? Any color you could give would be appreciated.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, I'd be happy to provide a little more color on that. If you look at the assets that we're talking about in terms of what our partners would get here in the U.S., it's actually a variety of a number of high-quality assets. I mentioned the Cardium, a very attractive tight oil play for us where we've got wells going down and we're drilling. We talked about West Texas and some of the unconventional oil plays we have going on there. And of course, the ability for Rosneft to improve their understanding of the technology that's at work out there and some of the practices we have and that we're doing to optimize the development of that is important to them. And as I talked about, as we learn about the unconventional resources together, what we have in Canada, what we have in the U.S., what they have in western Siberia, there'll be a lot of learning out of that. I also mentioned the Gulf of Mexico where they're going to have an opportunity to farm into 20 blocks. And as you know, we have been expanding our own activity in the Gulf of Mexico, have had some very nice success recently. So it would certainly not be a surprise that those would be attractive acreage opportunities for them. So again, I think you have to step back and look at this partnership just the way we described it. It's a strategic agreement for both parties. It allows us to bring to the table, each of us, very high-quality prospective resources, all of which rely on state-of-the-art and forward-looking technology applications and bring together the best of both companies and also in the interest of both companies going forward. So that's -- and we're talking about other opportunities elsewhere around the world. And so again, I keep coming back to the term Strategic Cooperation Agreement because that's really what it's all about, and you'll see that as we move forward.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So strong cash flow, good returns. But I guess there's still some criticism of Exxon's sort of overall liquids position in North America, and your shifting -- lowering rig count and shifting to some of the liquids plays you have. But can you give some color on the sort of ability for Exxon to really move the needle in terms of acquiring acreage outside of the Woodford Ardmore, the Cardium and Viking that you're talking to?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I think it would be fair to say, Ed, it's really kind of both. I mean, we're obviously taking advantage of opportunities, again, to concentrate acreage where we already have a position, and those efforts are bearing fruit. And of course, as you get bigger and more concentrated positions, you've got a real opportunity to better the -- again, the analysis and exploitation of those resources. Moving the needle, there are certainly opportunities, we believe, for that, however you define moving the needle. But those are really going to come, again, with a very deliberate, disciplined, analytical approach to how we go about doing this. I think as I mentioned last quarter, we're very fortunate to have the financial strength the company does and the flexibility to be able to go after these things in a disciplined, diligent way without worrying about paying the bills at the end of the month, and we continue to progress in that arena. We are looking at a broad range of other opportunities that are out there. I can't give you the specifics yet because we're still in the evaluation phase, but there are a number of those out there in North America and, frankly, in other areas. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also remind you of the success -- recent success, we've had with liquid in the Gulf of Mexico, with the big discovery we had there last year. So when you look across North American liquids opportunities, it's not just the unconventional oil potential, but it's also the potential that we have in our attractive acreage position in the Gulf of Mexico. And then broader speaking, I think's important, and you raise a good point, when you see the decline in our liquids production recently. I'll just reiterate one of the comments we made at the analyst meeting in March. If you look at the projects that are going to start up between now and 2016, I think the number we quoted was about 80% of that production will be liquids. So whether it's the Kearl project, whether it's the Africa projects, some of the other things we got going on, we have a strong portfolio of liquids projects in development, and also, the pipeline of opportunities on the exploration side is quite robust. So I think if you continue to look a little longer term, I think we're going to be in really good shape, and we're looking forward, as I mentioned in my remarks, to getting the projects up that we have on the plate for this year and then, in particular, when you get in that 2014 to 2016 time frame, bringing some of those big projects along as well.","Operator","And Citigroup's Faisel Khan has our next questions.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I can go back to Iraq. In your prepared remark or press release, you talked about a ramp-up in volumes in Iraq and kind of getting to your contracted volumes. Can you discuss a little bit about the infrastructure you're placing on the ground to get up to those contracted volumes that you guys have?","David S. Rosenthal","Faisel, help me out a little bit. In particular, infrastructure, what do have you have in mind?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Pipelines and water injection facilities, stuff like that, processing facilities, I guess, the basic midstream and infrastructure designed to deliver that oil to market.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. It's a couple of things. If you're looking in the field, in particular, of course, it's important for us to get the flow lines in and do some of the debottlenecking that we can do and thus get some production up that way. If you're looking broader at the infrastructure in terms of the common seawater project, some of the lifting capabilities, in particular, there was a major ramp-up in the capability to take oil out of the country last quarter. So there's a number of projects going on.  Again, some are kind of local and help get the production up. Some are broader. Those are progressing as well. I really don't have any specific comments in terms of timing of some of the other larger infrastructure projects, but those are progressing as well.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then last question for me, on non-U.S. Downstream, in the quarter, if I strip out kind of the gains on asset sales and also Imperial Oil reported a pretty nice number in refining as well, if I kind of take that out, it looks like outside of Canada and the asset sales that non-U.S. Downstream reported fairly low earnings. Can you talk about what's dragging those results this quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","If you're looking at the Downstream earnings you're really talking about quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of your emphasis, first quarter '12 versus first quarter '11?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's right.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, we had a number of things. I think the one I'd probably note, if you look at the margin impact that we showed slightly negative relative to some higher industry refining margins that you see quoted, we had a number of price timing effects on our feed slates into the refineries that had a negative impact there and probably would've given you a little impact there that you weren't expecting. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was positive in the first quarter of last year. We had the absence of that in the second quarter. So quarter-on-quarter, you kind of saw that. But I'll tell you, x those effects, things came in just about as we expected.","Operator","And now we'll go to Allen Good with MorningStar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder -- if I caught you correctly, you said 87,000 acres in the Utica. That seems to be up from the 75,000 you reported at the analyst day. I was just curious if you could confirm that. And then, you talked about the acreage adds in the Ardmore. Are there any other liquids-rich plays that are -- currently interest Exxon and you've been adding acreage in during the quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, let me just confirm, first of all, that the number I gave you of 87,000 is correct, and that is up from the 75,000 that we mentioned at year end. We have been incrementally adding some attractive acreage there as we went across the quarter.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, as far as the discovery in Tanzania, I just wonder, does that change Exxon's outlook there in East Africa? And would there be any potential there for additional acreage adds or maybe farm-ins with some already operators there in the region? Because it seems like it's -- it seems sort of a light portion of your portfolio currently, and obviously, the Tanzania discovery is a positive there. Just wonder sort of what's the outlook for Exxon in that region.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me first kind of hit the overall that you mentioned. There have been a number of discoveries announced by industry in that area over the last several months. We are very pleased to have the position we have in the block that we farmed into, and it's a very nice discovery. I think I mentioned 5 TCF of recoverable gas, so that's a very positive for us. We are very interested in appraising that prospect further and have some plans in place to do that. In terms of going forward and looking at other things, I wouldn't be any more specific other than to say we're always looking for opportunities, for good opportunities. We were looking when we found this one and pleased to have it. So without being specific or really any departure from past practice, we're always looking for good opportunities. This is one. We're pleased to have it. Probably get our next well underway here in the second quarter to further appraise that prospect. And I'll tell you, in terms of additional opportunities, there are a series of additional structures on the block we have to take a look at and do some more work and appraise. So more to come from on that block with our partner, Statoil. And again, we're both very encouraged with this.  Lots to do on that block, but always looking for additional opportunities.","Operator","Argus Research Philip Weiss has our next questions.","Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company","Most of my questions have been answered. I just had one small one. On your profitability per barrel, was down relative to the movement in realizations, and I just wondered if that was a function of the underlift or if there's something else going on there.","David S. Rosenthal","It's a number of the things I mentioned. Certainly, the underlift would be a big component because you have the reported production that you're dividing the earnings by, and that's why I really wanted to give you the detail on the underlift. It's a big impact. Also, the tax rate impact I mentioned because of some of the mix that we saw, of course, had an impact on calculated unit profitability. Other than that, in the quarter, we did see a little higher OpEx, including some exploration expense higher, that you would've seen in the supplement that we gave you. But again, it's really the U.S. gas price on the North American side and then the mix that we saw overseas and some of the other factors that were the real driver there.","Operator","And Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James has our last questions.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you give an update on the status at PNG LNG? There's been some press reports about local conflict with residents, and construction, I believe, was suspended for a period of time.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me give you a progress update on how we're doing in the first quarter. We've done some additional drilling, a number of other efforts associated with the project, everything from the civil works to the work we're doing on the gas conditioning plant and just a number of progress items related to the pipelines, the plant and all of that. So that project is really progressing on schedule, and we're very pleased with how things are going there. You have seen in the press some of the issues around unrest. It's one of the challenges we have with the project. Each large project we seem to do around the world has its own unique set of challenges, so there's nothing out of the ordinary here. We are managing that situation in conjunction with the local communities and with the government. And as you would guess, there has, here and there, been some impact at the individual work sites where some of this activity has occurred. But I can tell you, if you step back and look across the whole project, and it is a complex project, we are on schedule. We're progressing as planned, and there's no change to our outlook for a 2014 startup of that very attractive project.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you just say if construction is currently ongoing at the LNG site?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. Construction is ongoing, yes. We're continuing to progress all phases of the project. ","Thank you. I want to thank everybody for your time today and the excellent set of questions. So again, thank you and look forward to visiting with you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8373":["Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 31, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","David S.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth improved modestly in the second quarter. U.S. economic activity recovered after contracting in the first quarter. China's growth rate strengthened due to increased exports and government stimulus, while Europe's economic recovery remained moderate.","Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased by more than $4 a barrel, narrowing the discount to Brent, while Western Canadian Select prices also strengthened. U.S. natural gas prices decreased compared to the first quarter. Global industry refining margins strengthened, while strong chemical commodity margins were offset by weaker specialty margins.","Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 4.","ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $8.8 billion or $2.05 per share. The corporation distributed $6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion. CapEx was $9.8 billion in the quarter and $18.2 billion year-to-date, down 17% from the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.6 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $6.3 billion and debt was $21.8 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased by about $500 million from $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $6 billion. Other financing activities increased cash by $400 million. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the third quarter of 2014.","Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results.","ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings of $8.8 billion increased by $1.9 billion from the second quarter 2013, primarily reflecting gains on asset sales and higher earnings across all business segments. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 7, earnings decreased by $320 million, as lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher Upstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million a quarter.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 8. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $7.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the second quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $580 million, primarily driven by higher liquids realizations. On a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations increased by $4.48 per barrel. Worldwide natural gas realizations decreased $0.39 per thousand cubic feet, as higher U.S. gas prices were offset by lower international realizations. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $200 million due to a net underlift, primarily in West Africa, and lower gas volumes. Excluding the underlift impact, volume\/mix was a positive factor of about $50 million, reflecting higher-margin production growth, primarily from North America and Papua New Guinea. All other items increased earnings by $1.2 billion mainly due to gains on asset sales in Hong Kong.","Moving to Slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil-equivalent production decreased by 2.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 8,000 barrels per day. Increased U.S. liquids production and [indiscernible] volumes were mostly offset by a scheduled maintenance in Canada and Kazakhstan, base decline and unfavorable entitlement and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 604 million cubic feet per day, as lower weather-related demand in Europe and expected fuel decline were partly offset by new production from PNG LNG.","Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 10. Upstream earnings increased $98 million versus the first quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $620 million, reflecting expected lower seasonal demand in Europe, scheduled maintenance and underlift impacts primarily in West Africa. All other items had a positive impact of $920 million, primarily driven by net gains on asset sales. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $23.07, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes.","Moving to Slide 11. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were down 288,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or about 6.9% sequentially. Liquids production was down 77,000 barrels per day mainly due to scheduled maintenance in Canada, Kazakhstan and the North Sea, along with unfavorable entitlement impacts. Increased U.S. liquids production provided a partial offset. Natural gas volumes were down 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe and cutter [ph] Downtime, partly offset by the addition of PNG LNG volumes.","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 12. Downstream earnings for the first quarter were $711 million, up $315 million from the second quarter of 2013. Margins decreased earnings by $330 million, driven by lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $280 million, reflecting reduced planned maintenance activities. Other items increased earnings by $370 million primarily due to the absence of Dartmouth Refinery conversion costs and lower maintenance expenses.","Turning to Slide 13. Sequentially, second quarter Downstream earnings decreased by $102 million primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix effects and higher maintenance activities, partially offset by higher margins.","Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 14. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $841 million, up $85 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to favorable volume\/mix and ForEx effects. Stronger commodity margins were offset by weaker specialties margins.","Moving to Slide 15. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased by $206 million primarily due to lower specialty margins and higher planned maintenance activities.","Moving now to an update on year-to-date cash flow growth, as shown on Slide 16.","Strong free cash flow of $14.8 billion represented an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $29 billion more than covered the $14.2 billion invested in the business and $11.7 billion distributed to shareholders, with remaining cash used for other financing activities and addition to our cash balance. This year-to-date free cash flow growth reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and a disciplined capital allocation approach.","As highlighted in our March Analyst Meeting, we are starting up a number of major projects that will add significant profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling us to make significant progress and achieve key milestones. One of these milestones was the PNG LNG project startup in April, which was months ahead of schedule. We have now ramped up to full production through both LNG trains and are currently producing close to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. Through July, we have already loaded 15 cargoes for delivery to customers in Asia. The project was completed below the $19 billion budget announced in 2012 and produces LNG at a unit cost that is one of the lowest in the region. This achievement is a good example of how ExxonMobil creates value through technology applications and leading project execution capabilities. Learnings will be applied to other LNG projects that we plan to progress.","In Angola, the CLOV project, of which ExxonMobil owns a 20% interest, started operations in June. Production is now ramping up and expected to reach 160,000 barrels per day. Offshore Sakhalin Island, the top side of the Berkut platform has been installed onto the gravity-based structure at the Arkutun-Dagi field. The operations set a world record for installation of the heaviest integrated topside structure, weighing over 42,000 tons and using the world's largest ocean-going barge to carry and then set the structure. Berkut is now the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia. The facility will start up later this year and will add up to 90,000 barrels per day to Sakhalin-1 oil production.","Let me now provide a quick update on Kashagan. The project partners have agreed to work towards a progressive transition from the current venture model to a consolidated joint venture company operating under a single corporate management system, integrating the existing processes and tools from the venture entities. An experienced ExxonMobil executive has been appointed as the Managing Director of the operating company. Regarding the pipeline issues, the current assessment is that both oil and gas pipelines need to be replaced. The North Caspian Operating Company is now developing a full replacement plan.","Turning now to Slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities.","In Argentina, we drilled and successfully completed 2 ExxonMobil-operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, while the La Invernada X-3 well will be flow-tested during the third quarter. Our active program continues, with additional wells planned to be drilled in the second half of the year.","In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made an additional discovery in Block 2. The Piri-1 well discovered gas in a high-quality reservoir, confirming an additional 2 to 3 TCF of gas in place. 6 gas discoveries in Block 2 have been made to date, with total resource in place estimated at 20 TCF. ExxonMobil, Statoil, BG and Ophir completed an evaluation of potential sites for our common onshore LNG plant and made a location recommendation to the government of Tanzania.","Drilling operations are also currently underway on 2 blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. At Pirmam, we have successfully drilled to target depth and are preparing to test the well in the third quarter. In Alqosh, we are drilling ahead and anticipate reaching target depth in the third quarter.","In Romania, we have spud the Domino-2 well in the Neptun Block in the Black Sea. Data collected from the well will aid in the development planning for the gas field discovered in 2012 by the Domino-1 well. We will then move on to additional exploration drilling in the block.","Turning now to Slide 19 and an update on our Downstream business. During the quarter, we achieved notable investment milestones to increase high-value product sales. We commissioned the Clean Fuels project at the Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery in Saudi Arabia. The project reduces sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel by more than 98% to meet more stringent fuel standards in the kingdom. The project included new hydrotreating and sulfur recovery facilities and started up successfully and on budget.","In China, we completed the expansion of the Tianjin lubricants plant to increase the supply of high-value Mobil-branded lubricants. Work is also underway to significantly increase the blending capacity at the Taicang lubricant plant, with expected completion by the end of 2015. Together, these 2 projects will increase our local capacity by 75% and help meet the growing demand for high-quality lubricants in China.","We also recently approved a project to install a new 50,000 barrels per day delayed coker unit at our Antwerp refinery in Belgium. The unit will convert low-value residual oil from our Northwest Europe refineries into higher-value transportation fuel products such as diesel. This is another example of selective investments we are making at our competitively advantaged sites, further strengthening our industry-leading portfolio. Startup is planned for 2017.","Turning now to Slide 20 and an update on our Chemical business, where we are also progressing several projects to grow high-value product sales.","We received all final regulatory approvals and started construction of a multibillion-dollar ethane cracker at our existing fully integrated Baytown, Texas, complex and associated premium product facilities in nearby Mont Belvieu. The steam cracker will have a capacity of up to 1.5 million tons per year and provide ethylene feedstock for further chemical processing at 2 new 650,000 tons per year high-performance polyethylene lines. This project is made possible, in large part, by abundant affordable supplies of U.S. natural gas for energy and chemical feedstock. The expansion will enable us to economically supply rapidly growing demand for high-value polyethylene products used in a variety of consumer and industrial applications. Startup is planned in 2017.","We also recently approved expansions of our specialty hydrocarbon fluid facilities in Antwerp and Singapore. These projects will upgrade refinery streams into higher-value specialty chemical products to serve rapidly growing demand in extended-reach drilling, hydraulic fracturing and other industrial applications. These investments underscore the benefits of our business integration and technology advantage to capture advantage feedstocks and increase high-value product sales. Startups are planned in 2015 and 2016.","I would like to conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance.","ExxonMobil's strong financial and operating results reflect our ability to grow cash flow and provide robust shareholder returns, as we presented during the Analyst Meeting in March. Total earnings year-to-date, $17.9 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. In the Upstream, production of 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is right in line with our plans. Actions we took to improve Upstream profitability and grow higher-margin production increased unit earnings to $22.19 per barrel, up from $18.03 a barrel in 2013. In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, we progressed attractive investments to strengthen the portfolio and continue to leverage integration benefits.","Our strong operating results, combined with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generated robust free cash flow of $14.8 billion, an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. This strong performance enabled us to maintain industry-leading shareholder distributions.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","David, what have the impacts of sanctions been on your operations in Russia?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, look, Paul, I know our activities in Russia are a matter of great interest to you and everybody else on the call and rightfully so. But what I can tell you as of this morning is that we are waiting for further details on the sanctions in order to better understand how we need to comply. But I have to tell you, given that we simply don't have sufficient information, I'm just not in a position this morning to comment any further on the impact of the sanctions.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. The CapEx in Russia, is that financed from within Russia? I was thinking that given the scale of your operations in Sakhalin, maybe it's kind of an internally -- an internal Russian financing operation?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I really don't have the details of that. We finance our operations in a number of different ways. And I don't really have a specific comment on Sakhalin or the rest of our activities.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","So essentially, the status is that we're -- you're waiting for more clarification on any limits that may be placed on, I guess, investment and operations?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, and as you know, what's been in the press has been people's thoughts and expectations, but we really just haven't seen the detailed written sanctions. And so until we have those and have a chance to assess them and evaluate them, again it just puts me in a position this morning where I really can't make any specific comments.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Understood. And then my follow-up is totally separate. The construction started at Baytown you highlighted, that, I think, is advanced against schedule, isn't it? And is that fully permitted, and obviously, final investment decision and everything else? And what is the expected completion date?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, that project is right on our plan. We do have all of our permits in place. Construction has started. We put that picture in the slides this morning to kind of show we're digging dirt and the project's underway. Even throughout the permitting process, we were well underway getting all the engineering lined up, all the contractors, all the supply chain so that once we had the permits, we were ready to go. So no change to what we told you at the Analyst Meeting. We're on schedule so far, and we do expect to have that project up and running sometime in 2017.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So a couple of questions, please. The promise of improving on operating cash flow is obviously a big theme from your Analyst Day. We don't really see any substantial margin change this quarter with the startup of PNG and, I guess, Kearl ramping up. So I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you see the -- what the drivers of that change in cash flow are in terms perhaps of how the margin could change for your new portfolio of assets, which I guess will be about a quarter of the company in 2017? And any color you can give, qualitatively if necessary, but just to give some comfort that, that turn is coming? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, sure, Doug. Let's talk about that a little bit as we look at how things have really evolved over the last, say, 12 months. We have seen some pretty significant increase in our unit profitability and our ability to capture changes in the realizations as they come along. If I look at where we are so far in the first half of '14 on Upstream profitability relative to 2013, we're up over $4 a barrel on unit profitability. And if I go back and I take out all of the asset management, asset sales, related gains in all the periods, unit profitability is up right at $2. So I think you're starting to see the impact of the trend that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting of reducing our exposure to lower-margin barrels and barrels where we don't have quite the upside potential. And you're just now starting to see some of the projects that we've talked extensively about coming online. I mean Papua New Guinea LNG is an example. It's just started up, but it's one of several projects to come on in the next couple of years, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, all of which are accretive to average unit profitability and average unit cash flow. So I think, in our production volumes, we're starting to see the benefit of that. Again, it's early. We've just started up the project. We have a number of projects yet to come over the course of the year. Of course, Papua New Guinea will be ramping up. We'll have the Lucius project coming up later in the year. And I might give you an update on that, as you know, at the time of the Analyst Meeting, and when we put out our F&O review, we had a 15% interest in the Lucius project. That interest is now up to 23% -- a little over 23% through a normal redetermination exercise as well as our exercising our preemptive rights on the Apache sales. So that project will be starting up later this year, and again, we'll have about 23% of those barrels. Hadrian South will also start up at the same time. So again, the projects we talked about are on schedule, and they're coming online. And they will be accretive to those, to the unit profitability we talked about. There's a number of other things that you see as we progress through and looking at the year-to-date cash flow, including an active asset management program, and you saw the impact of that. So as I kind of look back really at the first half and kind of staying away from the first quarter versus the second quarter and looking at the 6 months, we are spot on the outlook we gave you on production in the Analyst Meeting. As you've seen in our supplement, U.S. liquids production is up fairly significantly, and we continue to grow that production as we said we would. That will also add to the improving margins. So cash flow's good. Free cash flow is dramatically better than last year. We're continuing to provide the shareholder with strong returns. We raised the dividend again, as you know, almost 10% in the second quarter. So as we kind of sit back, and we look at the first half results and compare to what our plans were and compared to last year, we're very encouraged and very confident that we'll continue to deliver the growth that we had talked about and continue to trend up on unit profitability and the cash flow. So from our perspective, everything's right on track, and we look forward to continuing to deliver the commitments we've made to the shareholder.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll make my follow-up a very quick one, hopefully. So assuming the spending level does hold around the $37 billion number, all things equal, it's the age-old question for you guys: You're going to have a lot of free cash flow. How are you thinking about the dividend nowadays as opposed to stepping up the buyback? Because when we traveled recently, I think your message was, \"well, that cash flow will go back to shareholders.\" So if you could help frame the importance of one over the other as you stabilize the underlying production base, that would be helpful. And I'll leave it there.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Thanks, Doug. As you mentioned, at constant prices, yes, as we deliver the plan that we outlined at the Analyst Meeting, we do expect to see a continued increase on our cash flow generation. And keeping the CapEx at the levels we discussed would, by definition, improve free cash flow, again just as we've seen dramatically here in the first half. In terms of the capital allocation, no change to our prior approach. We're going to stay disciplined on the capital. We're going to fund our best projects. And I think, as we've talked about in the Analyst Meeting and folks are beginning to recognize, our opportunity portfolio is quite extensive at this point, and that's going to allow us to be selective. So we'll continue to be disciplined on the capital side. We will continue to pay a very consistent and increasing dividend over time, and I think you've certainly seen evidence of that over the last few years. And after you accomplish those 2 things, the rest of the cash flow will flow back to the shareholder through the share buyback program. So no change in approach, no change in how we're doing our capital allocation, but again, we are certainly looking forward to continued success in our project ramp-up, continued success in upgrading the value of our molecules in the Downstream and Chemical and delivering that profitable growth that we talked about a lot in the Analyst Meeting. So thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, very small question first, just on asset sale gains in the quarter, if you shout out the actual number in this quarter, if you have that?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. In total, the gains from asset sales on an absolute basis were about $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of that in the Upstream and the other $100 million in the Downstream and Chemical.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Let's talk bigger picture about the Permian. Obviously, at the Analyst Day, you spoke about 1.5 million acres. Do you have a breakdown of how much of that is kind of CBP, how much is that is Midland?","[Audio Gap]","Delaware Basin for more the application of horizontal drilling?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. I'll start out by saying, if you look at that whole 1.5 million acres, it is spread throughout the Midland basin and the Delaware Basin. We're in a number of different areas, and that really gives us the opportunity to do a number of things to grow our production there, including a lot of things in the conventional fields, water floods, CO2 floods. We've got 65 workover rigs still running in the Permian, in addition to the other rigs that we have drilling exploration wells. So we have a lot of exposure to both conventional and unconventional, again, across -- broadly across the basin in Texas and in New Mexico. As we look at the various areas that I know people are interested in, we certainly have some very good acreage in the prime areas for the Wolfcamp, and we're just getting started in there. The Bone Springs is another one that we're working on. So when you look at this ramp-up in growth that we've seen to date, and you've seen the numbers of the significant growth in liquids in the U.S. year-over-year, we are just now beginning to scratch the unconventional plays and getting some of those wells down and see what we've got going on. We've got about 5 rigs drilling horizontal wells today in, again, the Wolfcamp, the Bone Springs and a number of areas. We have brought 93 wells online this year. That's up almost 70% from last year about this time. So a lot of activity, a lot of growth but just scratching the surface of the potential in that area. So we're excited to have the opportunities that we have across the basin, across the platform and, in particular, the wide variety of things we have to work on in that play. So it's not just unconventional. It's a number of resource opportunities, and you'll continue to see us ramp up activity there and see that production. Again, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, that is a big-time focus area for us, as is the Bakken where we're having tremendous success as well, and the Woodford Ardmore area. So I can tell you, sitting here mid-year, the opportunity is there. We're developing it, and we're seeing that production increase right in line with our expectations.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And if I can be very sneaky: Is it fee acreage, or is it more recently sold in the Permian? I'm thinking about the royalty position. Some are starting to disclose where they are on that.","David S. Rosenthal","Oh, yes, we -- no, we've got -- most of our acreage is fee acreage. And as you know, that's a big help on the royalties.","Operator","We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had a question for you on the production profile. I know you kind of confirmed that you're on track to meet your full year target. 2Q came in a bit light compared to what we were looking for. I know you referenced some maintenance and European nominations were weak. Is it fair, as we kind of move into second half, to think that 2Q is a low point? I know you'll have CLOV ramping up and maybe some of that maintenance coming back online. Or any color you can give us on how to kind of think about second half of the year?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, sure. If we look at the first half in particular, if we look sequentially where the volumes came down quite a bit. Just on the liquids side, downtime was worth 66,000 barrels a day for us from first quarter to second quarter. So we had a very heavy maintenance load up in Canada; in Kazakhstan, at Tengiz; and a number of other places, in North Sea, for example. So while we did see the benefit from projects at PNG and Kearl, they were masked by, again, this planned maintenance, seasonal maintenance, but it did have quite an impact on us. As we typically do going forward into the second half, that maintenance gets done and those things come back. And the other impact we had sequentially again was a sharp reduction in gas sales. I think our demand in Europe was probably worth over 150,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day on the gas side. And then we also had some downtime. So I'd characterize -- if you're looking at the second quarter, characterized by a extremely heavy maintenance load and your typical seasonal decline in Europe volume coming off a low base, because of the low winter. So the offset of that, of course, is PNG LNG starting up. The increase you've seen in the higher-margin U.S. liquids volumes. They just weren't enough to offset these other factors. As we head into the second half of the year, you will see these maintenance items come back up, as they typically do, and then the project startups that I talked about: full ramp-up of PNG LNG; and then the other projects that I mentioned, Lucius and some of the other ones. So we would certainly expect to see the benefit of both of those factors coming out of the second quarter. And that's why I really wanted to focus a little bit of time this morning on how we're doing year-to-date, because I think the real key measure of our performance and whether or not we're delivering on the targets that we established at the March Analyst Meeting is we are right on plan. In fact, we're a little ahead in some areas, like U.S. liquids production, for example; PNG LNG, a little ahead. Some other things are a little behind, European demand, for example, on the gas side. We continue to ramp up Kearl, and that progress is also looking good as we head into the second half of the year. So again, if we look past the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and focus on where we're at year-to-date and what we're expecting in the second half, I can assure you we are spot on to deliver the outlook that we gave you.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","The second question. One of your European counterparts has just announced the -- I guess, the initial steps to form an MLP. And it seems like Exxon is flushed with assets that would probably fit very nicely into one and really highlight the underlying value that's probably not reflected in the stock. I'm just curious if that is even on the radar screen?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, I'd say kind of generically everything's on the radar screen. We are just constantly looking at all of the things that are out there, all the options we have to realize full value from all of our assets, including our midstream assets. The one thing I'd remind you, if you recall, back in the 2011 and 2012 time frame, we actually sold a number of our midstream assets and realized extensive value for those. And those are reflected in the very strong gains on asset sales and cash flow we generated. Now if you look, step back and look at MLPs: Most companies are using those as a means to raise cash and finance growth or reduce their ownership costs or exposure. Those aren't strategic drivers for us. In our case, when we look at our midstream portfolio, these are strategic assets to us. We think we are monetizing the value of those, whether or not you would assert that they're adequately reflected in our share price yet. We are certainly monetizing those and maximizing the value in the integration of our full value chain and also as part of our logistics and integration between the Upstream, Downstream and chemicals. So you probably won't be surprised to know that we've taken a hard look at this and look at the assets and the opportunities, but we're -- we like what we have. We like the integration benefit. And in fact, if you've seen some of our recent announcements, we're actually investing more dollars in that part of the business. We mentioned the Edmonton rail project and a few other ones. So midstream assets are strategic to us. We think we're getting full value for them as part of the integrated business model that we have, but I wouldn't want you to ever think that we're not aware of and looking at everything that's out there that others are doing and some things others may not have thought about yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, maybe come back a little bit on the Permian question, just because we did see the -- I believe there was an asset swap that you did during the quarter. And since in general we're seeing a lot more activity heading that direction, maybe could you give us an idea, a little bit of sort of relative size? I know you don't like to get into a lot of details, but kind of relative size; and as we think about growth opportunities maybe of the Permian relative to the identified projects in the Gulf of Mexico, if there's any sort of, I don't know, additional detail, clarity, something there you could offer us?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. We did sign an agreement in the second quarter to do a swap that basically added about -- additional 26,000 net acres in the Permian. And virtually all of it, it was in the Midland basin, which of course, as you know, is prospective for the horizontal drilling that we talked about. If you add that to the acreage we talked about that we picked up earlier this year, we've now added 50,000, 60,000 prime acres right in the sweet spot of where we want to be. So that's good. And that's one of the reasons why we've increased rigs in that area. I mentioned the 65 workover rigs that we're running. And I think we've got 11 rigs running on the exploration and delineation and evaluation side, so certainly ramping up activity there and very encouraged by the results we're seeing. It's a very, very active area for us. Now in terms of activity relative to other areas, I have to also say the Bakken has -- is an area where we're also ramping up production quite significantly, and you see that in our results. We've got a lot of activity there. We've got 12 rigs running. That's up from where we've been in the past. Operated production was up 26% in the second quarter. So again, we're continuing to ramp up. The other play we've talked about is the Ardmore, and we've got higher rigs running there as well. One of the things, if I just kind of think about adding all of that up and looking at our liquids plays, production across the Permian, Bakken and Woodford Ardmore in the second quarter was over 200,000 barrels a day. And that was up about over 25% from a year ago and up quarter-to-quarter. So we're continuing to work that. Comparing those opportunities to the Gulf of Mexico, we're fortunate that we've got opportunities in both of those areas. We do have major projects coming on and starting up. I mentioned Lucius, which is the oil development there starting up before the end of the year. The gas piece of that project for us, Hadrian South, will also start up and bring on additional volumes. We continue to work on Julia, and that's progressing well. And then there are a couple of other projects that we also have an interest in. So that's coming through. We've also picked up some additional very attractive exploration acreage. Recently, we were awarded the 3 blocks that we were the high bidder on right over there on the trans-boundary area bordering up against Mexico. So we've got those 3 blocks awarded to us there in the gulf, and we're hoping that'll lead to some opportunities down the road beyond that. So both of those areas are looking good. The Gulf of Mexico never delivers 100% success rate to anybody, and we've drilled a couple of dry holes ourself. But if we step back and look across the last several years and what we've got on the plate going forward, we like what we have. And we're looking forward to getting these high-margin volumes up and running here later in the year.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then it kind of segues into what my other question was going to be. Mexico, clearly, they've made progress on the legislative side. We still need to see what the actual rules are going to be and get a good feel for timing, but can you talk a little bit about what Exxon sees as the possibilities in Mexico over the next, oh, I don't know, 3 to 5 years as this develops?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, we're certainly encouraged by what we've seen to date. And we're certainly respectful of the process of deliberation that's going on and as they work through their legislative process, and we're monitoring that closely. We have a long history in Mexico, and we are certainly anxious to see how all this comes out and what opportunities might be available for us along those lines. Again, as I mentioned a minute ago, we do have those 3 blocks awarded to us right there on the boundary of the Mexican blocks in the deepwater gulf. And so we'll see if that can help generate opportunities, but we're encouraged today, anxiously awaiting the -- how all of that finalizes and all the details come out over time. And then we'll pursue any opportunities that are attractive to us, but we certainly like our position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So for clarification, how does the $1.6 billion of Upstream asset sales that you mentioned a minute ago reconcile with the $1.2 billion other figure that you highlighted on Slide 8? And do you have any geographical segmentation for either of those results?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. So if you're looking at the $1.2 billion that we mentioned, that was kind of the delta quarter-on-quarter, okay? And -- because we had a number of asset gains last quarter and then last year. So if you're looking at the total picture there, and again there are other items in the earnings rec, but just to be clear, in the Upstream, the total value of the asset sales in earnings was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And then if you look quarter-over-quarter, that's about $1.5 billion, with an offset of a couple of hundred million dollars in some other things like startup expenses and that sort of thing. If you're looking at the sequential comparison, we had about $400 million of gains on asset sales in the first quarter this year, so the delta there is about $1.2 billion in earnings. So I hope that sorts it out for you. And then we talked separately in the call about the impact on the cash flows.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, over the years, ExxonMobil and its peers have employed fairly substantial portfolio management programs to support returns on capital. And with the decline in returns across the sector over the past 4, 5 years, the pace has accelerated for some companies and with positive effect on returns and their values in the market. So my question is, with ExxonMobil's returns following what the industry did over the last several years, why wouldn't the company be using portfolio strategies -- portfolio management more rather than the same, or less, to enhance its returns profile? That is, if you think that it's not. So really, any updated thinking on portfolio management strategy in light of the industry context is appreciated, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, yes, thanks, Doug. I would say there's really 2 items to talk about in return -- in regard to the return performance here over the last couple of years. First, with regard to asset sales, they're not linear. We had a number of asset sales in '11 and '12. And I think the combination of those 2 years yielded about $20 billion in cash flow, very strong. Last year was less of a year. This year, we're off to a pretty solid start between the first quarter and the second quarter and, in particular, what we've generated here with our asset sales. So the program is ongoing. We don't make an announcement in advance of what we're going to do. We find that gives us a little better negotiating strategy when we do actually sit down and talk about selling assets. So we don't have any stated objective. We don't have any target that we feel we must make, but we're certainly able to take advantage of anything in the market that gives us a chance to realize value for our shareholders. Fortunately, for us, we don't have to sell assets in order to make a dividend payment or another distribution because of the cash flow we generate. And again, reference back to that chart I showed you. I think one of the other things to keep in mind when you look at Upstream ROCE over the last few years, particularly in our case, and I can't speak for others. But one of the aspects of these very large legacy plateau-volume, nondeclining-volume projects, however you want to call them, is all the CapEx is upfront. And so there, as you're building these projects, and particularly in our case, I mean we talk about bringing on 1 million barrels oil-equivalent a day of production between '13 and '17. By definition, you've got a lot of steel in the ground to produce 1 million barrel of oil-equivalent a day. And until that capital starts up, that's nonproductive capital. So that, I think, at least for us, has been a big driver in terms of ROCE. And as you know, as those projects crank up, Papua New Guinea being a perfect example, you go from nonproductive capital in the ground to productive capital and, in this case, highly productive capital. So again, part of bringing all of these projects online, part of ramping up the production is the earnings, the cash flow and the ROCE that comes along with that. And then on the Downstream side, of course, we continue to have industry-leading returns and continue to make incremental investments there to at least maintain, if not increase, that advantage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, on Kearl phase 1, the ramp-up has been -- I think, probably is lower than what the investor has been expecting. From you guys standpoint internally, that -- when do you think all the startup issue will be fixed and then you will be running at a sustainable rate towards the full capacity? Is it going to take another year, 6 months? Any kind of rough time line that -- internally that you guys is forecasting?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Paul, let me give you a quick update on Kearl, because we have seen a continued ramp-up in the production. I did -- I mentioned that in the second quarter although on the surface it looks like production was flat at about 66,000 barrels a day first quarter and second quarter. But recall we did have some planned maintenance there in April that took us way below that number. I can tell you, as we came out of that April downtime for maintenance, production picked up quite well. And in fact, we achieved record production in the month of June of almost 80,000 barrels a day. So we've not quite reached the lined-out production and our expectations, but we are making progress. A number of the issues that you are aware of are being resolved and we're working on that. Again, I have to stress that although we're certainly a little disappointed in the ramp-up over the last year from what our original expectation was, the technology is working fine. We've actually been able to run each of the 3 froth treatment trains above their designed capacity. That's very encouraging. And so the objective for us now is to get all 3 of them running simultaneously on a consistent basis at or above their designed capacity. And when we achieve that, that's when you really see that volume change. So we're encouraged at the capability of the assets that we've put in place. We're encouraged with the -- with how the technology is working. We are working on the ramp-up and look to improve that. I can't give you a specific date on which we'll achieve 110,000 barrels a day or some number greater than that, but we are making progress, and we're looking forward to continue that progress. I can also say, on the other side of the Kearl initial development, the expansion project is going very well. I'm pleased to say for another quarter that the project is on schedule and on budget, which on the backs of the Papua New Guinea LNG project, very unusual in our industry for somebody in my position to sit here on an earnings call and tell you the projects are on budget and on schedule. So acknowledged that the ramp-up in Kearl first phase hasn't been quite what we were expecting, but again want to confirm that we're making progress, and we're encouraged with the results we've seen so far this year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, you guys have some very decent success on the shale oil. Do you have a number you can share what is your total shale oil production in the second quarter average? And comparing to the full year 2013? And whether you can break it down between the black oil, condensate, NGL and gas?","David S. Rosenthal","I can't break down the split between oil, NGL and gas, but the numbers I gave just a minute ago on the call across the Permian, the Bakken and the Ardmore are pretty indicative of what we're doing. Although, not all of it in the Permian, as I mentioned, is unconventional oil. But I think, without a specific number, again, when you look at the numbers that we had in the supplement to the press release, you see the 38,000 barrels a day increase in U.S. liquids year-over-year. And we look at how things are going, again, in the big three, the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore and the Permian, we're ramping up to that level that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting, and we continue to move forward. And I'll continue to give you an update on a quarterly basis.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I just sneak in a quick question, a final one? There's a article, I think, out there talking about Exxon is evaluating to have a major expansion in one of your Texas refinery. That seems to be very uncharacteristic or quite different than what Exxon historically has been building or their refining strategy in the U.S. I want to see whether you can comment on that.","David S. Rosenthal","Paul, the first thing I'd say is I'm not going to make a specific comment on any rumors or speculation that are out there in the press. We are regularly looking at our portfolio around the world. I mentioned the investment we're putting into the Antwerp plant, which you might say, \"Why would you be putting money into Europe given its current weak spot on the margin side?\" But again, that's consistent with our strategy of upgrading molecules, very nice project to take what is currently a low-value resid strain and upgrade it into very high-value diesel and other project -- and other products. So when we look at the U.S., when we look at Europe, when we look at Asia Pacific, we're always looking at opportunities, and what we can do to either upgrade any molecule that's flowing through our system, how we can take advantage of already-advantaged assets, like our refining circuit, and improve that. So the -- for us to be looking at many different things should not come as a surprise. But rather than mention anything specifically, and coming back to the strategy that we've articulated, I think I can really go back to what we said at the Analyst Meeting: You look at our Downstream strategy. It's all about expanding feedstock flexibility; increasing high product yields -- high-value product yields; reducing operating costs; taking advantage of logistics, like we're doing in Europe that I mentioned in my prepared remarks; or pressing even more of the value we get from integration. So I would say there's no change in that strategy per se but wouldn't comment on any specific item that you might have read in the press somewhere.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On Russia, I appreciate the point that the sanctions have not yet been fully clarified, but can you confirm whether the Arctic exploration prospect with Rosneft is still set to spud in August?","David S. Rosenthal","Pavel, I -- again, I can understand the interest in the question, but I really have to come back to what I said at the opening. Until we have a chance to look at the sanctions, read them, assess them, evaluating -- evaluate them, it just wouldn't be appropriate for me at this point this morning really to make any comments specifically on any of our activities.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the -- you guys recently applied for a approval for the Gulf Coast LNG export terminal with Qatar. Any sense of when you're expecting that approval to be given?","David S. Rosenthal","I don't have a specific expectation. I think one of the things that's helpful for us is we went in a pre-FERC filing process for a while. We've been working on this, so this isn't brand new for us. I don't know exactly what the expectation is in terms of approvals or a number you have to get from the FERC, of course, from the DOE, et cetera. But I think, if you -- if we kind of look across -- how this thing might progress through the approval process, and if we can get to a position where we can FID this, you might be looking at some time frame for production around 2019, again without breaking it into its components. But nice opportunity for us. And we are certainly looking forward to an efficient process in terms of getting everything approved and getting our DOE approval for export to non-FTA countries and moving on with that project. But it's just one of many LNG opportunities we have in the portfolio. We're fortunate to have a number of things we can be working on around the world in various points of development, and this one is certainly one that we're working on real closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just a couple of quick ones, Dave. With the PNG gas, is that all contracted sales at this stage? Because you had some spot cargoes initially.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, we've been basically -- because the project has started up months early, the current cargoes that I talked about, they're basically, by definition, going in on a spot basis. And we're pleased with our ability to place those cargoes at attractive prices. As we get down to later on and the contracts all kick in, about 95% of the production is contracted on long-term contracts tied to the price of oil. And that is certainly part of -- if you'll recall, back at the Analyst Meeting when we said we would take the percentage of our total Upstream portfolio production from about 63% or 64% liquids or liquids linked up to about 69%. This is just an example of that, but yes, those -- the cargoes that we're placing now are basically spot but into the market. But again, we've been able to place them, and pleased with how that went and then really looking forward to getting this project continuing on. And again, just very pleased with the startup and very pleased that we were able to bring that project in under a budget that was 2 years old. The industry's gotten used to those annual updates of budgets on LNG projects and costs going up annually. And again, we're very pleased that -- to bring this thing in early and under our budget.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Last one for me is on your tax rate. Your effective tax rate was around -- maybe you said something, but I missed it.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, let me give you a little more color on that. You did see an effective tax rate around 41% or 42% or so. That is down from last year and also a little bit down from what we saw in the first quarter. The real impact you're seeing there is just a combination of the mix of our businesses, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical; geographic; some of our portfolio management activities; the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession. Of course, as is typical, asset sales tend to have a lower tax rate than earnings from your operations. So all of that kind of drove us a little low here in the second quarter. I can tell you, without giving a specific guidance and a specific number, but a normalized tax rate going forward ought to be somewhere in the mid 40s compared to upper 40s of prior history, somewhere in that order of magnitude, just to give you a feel for how that impact might roll through going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Guy Baber with Simmons Investment Bank.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Just one quick one for me and more of a point of clarification. But I wanted to ask about the U.S. liquids performance relative to your internal expectations. That's an area that's outperformed our model. You've given us some great detail on the call, so thanks for that. But wasn't sure if you'd said that the U.S. liquids production was tracking in line with the internal plan or it was outperforming? So just wanted to clarify there, as we try to think through the ultimate potential of your LRS portfolio in light of some of the longer-term guidance you gave at the Analyst Day previously.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Guy, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that a little bit. We are slightly ahead of our internal expectations for the year in the U.S. on liquids. I mentioned, in total, relative to what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we're kind of spot on, so -- but the puts and takes, kind of think of -- about it as still maybe a little bit behind on the Kearl ramp-up, but I addressed that earlier, but slightly ahead in the lower 48. We are very encouraged with the results we're seeing. We're very pleased with the additional opportunities. We are adding rigs. We are putting some additional resources into those areas. But bottom line, to answer your question, yes, we're a little bit ahead of where we even thought we'd be internally so far this year.","Operator","And our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just quickly, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but on the U.S. natural gas production, it looks like declines have been slowing over the past few quarters. This quarter, we actually saw sequential growth. Can you talk a little bit behind the moves there and what we may expect for the rest of the year and maybe into next year as well?","David S. Rosenthal","If we look at the gas business, yes, we're sequentially up just a hair but really about flat, down year-on-year, which is also consistent with what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. So you are seeing that kind of year-on-year decline as we move those resources more into the liquid side. If we're looking sequentially, I wouldn't read too much into that. We are about flat. It's probably just timing of frac-ing and completions and bringing wells on to sale. I would say kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, everything we're doing on the gas side is per the plan, and that's a broad statement as well as in the U.S. So the second quarter, we had some good performance, but again, I wouldn't want to give an indication that our full year outlook on the gas side is any different than what we might have said at the Analyst Meeting. We are seeing the bump up, of course, from the early startup of PNG, but then on the other hand, we came out of a very warm winter in Europe and those volumes were down fairly significantly. So I think what I would just say to wrap up your question and the call: Think about all the things we laid out for you in -- at the Analyst Meeting, both strategically and the strategic choices we're making; and upgrading our portfolio, high-value, higher-margin, higher-unit-profit products into the market, that's across all of our businesses; selective investments to continue to press those strategic advantages. And then zeroing in on Upstream production volumes, right on what we had expected and maybe a little better in a couple areas. And again, if you look at that year-to-date free cash flow chart and you look at the progress we've made in a number of areas, we're -- again, we're very pleased with how our first half is turning out so far this year.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Hansen","All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods. ","After I cover the quarterly and full year financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives selecting on 2019 and the year ahead. Following Darren\u2019s remarks, I'll be glad to address specifics on the reported results, while Darren will be available to take your questions on broader themes, including strategic priorities, progress on major growth projects, and views on market fundamentals. ","Our comments this morning will reference to slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation.","I\u2019ll now highlight fourth quarter financial performance starting on Slide 3. Earnings were $5.7 billion in the quarter or $1.33 per share including a positive $0.92 per share impact from the Norway divestment and a one-time tax item. ","Results were in line with expectations taking into account the challenging price and margin environment we have previously communicated. Liquids realizations were essentially flat, while Refining and Chemical margins weakened significantly in the quarter. ","The broader margin environment remained challenging as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and moved base stock margins despite modest improvement in the fourth quarter. ","Cash flow from operations in asset sales was $9.4 billion in the quarter after adjusting for changes in working capital, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $11.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $8.5 billion and $31.1 billion for the full year, slightly ahead of the previous projection of $30 billion with better than expected pace on the Beaumont light crude expansion and Baton Rouge polypropylene projects. ","And of course, the early startup of Liza Phase 1 in Guyana. Full year PP&E adds and net investments and advances, a proxy for cash CapEx was $26.8 billion. ","I\u2019ll now provide a more detailed view of developments since the third quarter on the next slide. In the Upstream, liquids realizations were essentially flat, while gas realizations improved slightly. Production was in line with expectations with higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. ","Liza Phase 1 achieved first oil ahead of schedule at just under five years from discovery, which is significantly ahead of the industry average of nine years. ","We also announced the 15th and 16th exploration discoveries with the Mako and Uaru wells offshore Guyana. We closed the sale of our Norway non-operated assets during the quarter highlighting good progress today on our $15 billion investment program. ","In the Downstream, refining fuels margins decreased during the quarter consistent with seasonal demand. In addition, weaker high sulfur fuel oil pricing did not fully reflect in crude spreads. As a result, low and medium conversion refinery margins weakened more than high conversion refinery margins. This had a notable impact on our Downstream results outside of the United States. ","And this demonstrates the importance of strategic investments like the recently sanctioned resid upgrade project at a refinery in Singapore which will greatly improve conversion complexity. Reliability in the Downstream improved in the quarter, largely offsetting higher scheduled maintenance. ","Although long-term fundamentals remains strong in the Chemical business, polyethylene margins continued to be impacted by supply lengths from industry capacity additions and in the fourth quarter, higher naphtha feed costs. ","With approximately 25% of our polyethylene portfolio produced from liquids feeds like naphtha, this had a significant impact on our Chemical business line results. On the project side, the recently completed Beaumont polyethylene expansion is running well and producing at 5% above design rates. ","As part of our collaborative efforts to develop and deploy lower emissions technologies, we signed a two-year expanded joint development agreement with FuelCell Energy to optimize carbonate fuel cell technology for large-scale carbon capture, and we extended our support of the MIT Energy Initiatives, low carbon research and education mission by renewing as a Founding Member for another five years.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter earnings relative to the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $5.7 billion were up $2.5 billion from the third quarter. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $4 billion driven by the gain on the Norway divestment, a favorable one-time tax item, higher volumes and improved gas realizations. ","Downstream earnings decreased by $330 million, due to lower margins, and higher scheduled maintenance, partly offset by improved reliability and favorable year-end inventory impacts. Also included in the Downstream results was a sequential $450 million negative mark-to-market impact on derivative positions, essentially offsetting the inventory effects. Chemical earnings decreased by $600 million driven by weaker margins, and higher expenses supporting growth projects. ","Finally, Corp and Fin earnings decreased by approximately $500 million due to the absence of a favorable, one-time tax item in the third quarter. ","Moving to Slide 6, full year earnings of $14.3 billion were down $6.5 billion from 2018. Upstream earnings increased by $360 million, driven by the Norway divestment and higher liquids volumes. It was partly offset by lower realizations and expenses supporting growth. ","Downstream earnings decreased by $3.7 billion, due to more narrow North American differentials, lower refining margins, higher scheduled maintenance and the absence of the Germany retail and Augusta divestments in 2018. And again here, included in the year-over-year results was a negative $420 million mark-to-market impact on derivative positions offsetting any benefits from the inventory effects.","Chemical earnings decreased by $2.8 billion driven by weaker margins, higher expenses supporting growth and the absence of a one-time tax item. ","I\u2019ll now provide more insight into the challenging 2019 price and margin environment on Slide 7. As shown here in the top left chart, cyclically low prices and margins across our business lines accounted for a year-over-year earnings decrease of $7.5 billion. All other earnings drivers netted out to a positive impact of $1 billion. ","The chart at the bottom left of the page provides a view of commodity prices and margins over the past ten years and the relative position of the environment we\u2019ve seen in 2019 and 2018. Now as we note here, the fourth quarter saw further deterioration in prices and margins, especially Chemical margins with the increase in liquid feed costs. ","While margins weakened from 2018 and remain on the low end of the 10 year range across many of our business lines, it\u2019s important to note these levels are generally consistent with the scenarios we use to test our investment decisions. ","Despite the challenging margin environment, long-term demand fundamentals remained strong. In fact, growth in demand in 2019 for Upstream liquids and natural gas, distillate products, and polyethylene was at the higher end of the compound annual growth rates experienced over the past ten years. ","While making investment decisions based on long-term fundamentals is challenging, when near-term prices and margins are under pressure, it provides us with the opportunity to leverage our competitive advantages including significant financial capacity. It allows us to benefit from the favorable environment that occurs when others pull back and the cost of investing declines. ","I\u2019ll now spend some time looking at the full year performance of each of our businesses in more detail starting with the Upstream. Volumes grew by 119,000 oil equivalent barrels per day with liquids growth of 5% driven by Permian, Hebron and Kaombo. ","Efforts to high grade our portfolio also resulted in gains on asset sales, primarily from the Norway divestments. And as indicated previously, liquids and gas realizations also impacted earnings with declines of 8% and 17% respectively. ","In the Downstream, more narrow North American crude differentials and lower margins reduced earnings by $3 billion. The change in differentials shown on the upper left chart accounted for $1.7 billion of that year-over-year decrease. ","Full year industry margins were 19% lower than 2018, pressured by new industry capacity additions that exceeded demand growth by 800,000 barrels a day and you can see that on the bottom left chart. ","Regarding IMO, we continue to see clean\/dirty product spread expand in the fourth quarter. However, light-sweet, and heavy-sour crude differentials have been slow to respond with lower global supply of sour crudes. Strong global refining runs coming out of forward maintenance and the previously mentioned industry capacity additions. ","The chart on the upper left of this page shows medium heavy-sour crude discounts relative to Brent through 2019. While the spread has expanded recently, crude discounts are not at parity with high sulfur fuel oil prices. The marine fuel supply chain fundamentals are still transitioning. Feed and product pricing have not reached equilibrium placing pressure on low to medium conversion margins. ","Now, we would expect this to result in fewer heavy-sour crude rents, ultimately leading to higher discounts and market parity. As we highlighted several times over the past years scheduled maintenance in the Downstream was higher than normal impart due to preparation for IMO. ","In fact, 2019 represented the highest level of scheduled maintenance for the Downstream in the past 15 years. This activity level decreased earnings by $700 million relative to 2018. ","As shown on the bottom left chart, we expect 2020 scheduled maintenance to be more typical in line with our historical average. ","Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019ll provide more perspective on the Chemical margin environment and its impact on earnings. Our Chemical portfolio is positioned well to take advantage of low cost feed and energy cost with over half of our polyethylene capacity in North America. This is balanced with our production footprint in Asia Pacific, which positions us near key growth markets. ","However, the current margin environment remains challenged with excess industry capacity despite demand growth of 4% per year since 2016. Now relative to 2018, lower margins reduced Chemical margins by $1.8 billion. ","In the fourth quarter, polyethylene margins were further impacted by tighter feed supply resulting in a 65% increase in the cost to produce ethylene from naphtha. Key industry price spreads shown on the bottom left of the chart declined by 40% on average for the year. Given our product mix, this is important. Since these changes impacted approximately 60% of our production. ","Now the significance of these market factors will obviously vary across the industry depending on product mix. Growth-related expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange and the absence of a one-time tax item also decreased Chemical earnings by approximately $700 million. ","I\u2019ll now provide a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter cash profile shown on Slide 12. Fourth quarter earnings, when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $6.4 billion in cash flow from operating activities. The $4.3 billion impact from working capital and other related to non-cash adjustments for the gain on the Norway divestment. ","Fourth quarter proceeds from asset sales of $3.1 billion, primarily reflects the cash received for the Norway asset sales. Fourth quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $7.4 billion. Gross debt was largely unchanged and cash ended the quarter at $3.1 billion. ","And with that, I will turn the call over Darren. ","Darren Woods ","Thank you, Neil. Good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to be on the call with you today. Let me start by sharing my perspective on last year beginning with margins. There is no doubt that 2019 was a challenging year for a number of our businesses. ","And I think Neil\u2019s chart made that point near or at 10 year lows on prices and margins for Gas, Refining and Chemicals. Fourth quarter was particularly challenging for our Chemical business. Of course, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s driving us and the implications for our businesses and our investment plans. ","As Neil said, and I\u2019ll show you later, the product demand underpinned our investments in each of these sectors remained solid. Depressed margins are driven by excess capacity, which will be a short-term impact particularly if industry pulls investments back significantly, which, by the way we are beginning to see. ","We know demand will continue to grow driven by rising population, economic growth and higher standards of living. We know that excess capacity will shrink, typically faster than people think and margins will rise, then, new capacity will be needed.","These are the classic price cycles of capital-intensive commodity industries. We believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages. As industries pull back, project costs come down, resulting in lower cost capacity additions, they are then available to catch the cycle upswing. This is a win-win, capturing high margins at a low \u2013 lower cost. ","The downside of course is to grow on cash, which we are seeing and responding to. Our organization is very focused on driving further efficiencies and looking for opportunities to optimize and\/or pace our investment portfolio, while preserving value and we reducing the draw. Our new projects organization in Upstream business lines are giving us a good line of sight on the best options to grow value efficiently. ","And as I said before, we have an important advantage, because of our large opportunity set, it gives us optionality in these volatile markets. We also have a very healthy balance sheet, which was built for times like this, giving us a significant advantage in maximizing medium to long-term value. ","So while we would prefer higher prices and margins, we don\u2019t want to waste the opportunity that this low price environment provides, which leads me to our 2019 performance. ","Our portfolio of integrated businesses helped in facing the short-term headwinds, generating $14 billion in earnings. If you normalize our 2019 results for the industry\u2019s price and margin environment and look at them on the same basis we used last March at our Investor Day, earnings were in line with the potential we communicated. ","Obviously, this is a theoretical exercise, but a very important one. We can\u2019t control the short-term price environment, stripping out the market impacts, allows us to judge the underlying progress we are making in building a stronger business based on the longer fundamentals. This is absolutely essential for a long cycle capital-intensive business. ","In the mean time, the lower price environment puts additional focus on driving efficiencies in both capital outlays and operating cost. It also drives us to ensure the schedule and mix of our capital expenditures are optimized. This is something our organization is very focused on. ","In 2019, we made good progress in upgrading and focusing our asset portfolio with the divestment of our Upstream Norway OBO business. We are on tracks with the plans that we outlined last March with a number of additional assets in the market. ","However, I want to emphasize that this is a value play. We are high grading our portfolio as higher quality opportunities come into our portfolio, we evaluate other assets for long-term strategic fit moving asset out, we have to find a buyer who can realize more value than we can. Otherwise, there is no space for a deal and we won\u2019t transact. ","We remain very excited by our investment opportunities, even in the price environment we saw last year, our investments would perform. It reinforces our capital investment strategy, which is invest in the long-term fundamentals with test against short-term lows. ","We made good progress on our projects in 2019 and used our financial capacity to mitigate the price environment resulting in a year-end leverage of 13%, a level we felt very comfortable with. ","We increased production by $119,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 3% increase over 2019 \u2013 2018. Nearly, all of this is attributable to the success we had in growing liquids, which increased by a 120,000 barrels per day or 5% relative to 2018. Continued ramp up in the Permian Basin was a significant driver of this growth. ","We continue to like what we are seeing in our Permian development. The organization is making very good progress on maximizing resource recovery, efficiently deploying capital and optimizing production. ","In addition, we are making good progress on our Logistics, Refinery and Chemical investments that leverage Permian production, giving us greater value through an integrated approach with the whole exceeded to some of the parts. We had another good year exploring with six major deepwater discoveries, five in Guyana and one in Cyprus. ","Guyana discoveries resulted in a 2 billion barrel increase in estimated recoverable resources, which now exceeds 8 billion oil equivalent barrels. In fact, we had four of the top 10 discoveries in the world and five out of the six largest oil discoveries. In recognition of this success, for the second year running, Exxon Mobil was named Explorer of The Year. ","We\u2019ve also made progress in our work to develop new lower emissions technologies to help address the risk of climate change. While renewable like wind and solar play an important role, they don\u2019t solve the emissions challenge for every market, geography or application. Deciding these new technologies that will reduce emissions, while meeting the growing demand for affordable and reliable energy.","We are leveraging our research organization to help develop them. In 2019, we signed or extended eight agreements with a variety of companies and institutions to expand research into lower emissions technologies. ","This adds to the more than 80 collaborations we have in place across academia, national labs and energy centers to scale up advanced biofuels, carbon capture technology, and less energy-intensive manufacturing processes. ","These efforts address sectors that account for 80% of emissions, commercial transportation, power generation and industrial. In summary, looking at the year in total, I am pleased with the progress we have made, particularly in light of the challenging market conditions. ","Almost two years ago, we outlined a plan to grow the value of our corporation, robust to the price cycles inherent in our industry. Two years down the road, we are delivering on those plans doing what we said we would. ","With the increased supply and corresponding drop in margins, we\u2019ve increased our focus on efficiencies, while we continue to optimize our investment portfolio, again, taking advantage of the optionality that comes with a large number of opportunities, which I\u2019d like to turn to next. ","In the Upstream, I\u2019ve already mentioned our success in Guyana, which I\u2019ll come back to in a few moments. Development of our deepwater portfolio in Brazil, another key asset remains on track with exploration activities planned over the next couple of years to better quantify this high potential resource. We are also making good progress in the Permian, which I\u2019ll talk more about when we get to a slide later in the deck. ","In the Downstream, three of our major projects are online and contributing to earnings and cash flow even in last year\u2019s challenging market. These projects position us well for the growth in demand of higher-value distillates and lubricant-based stocks. The remaining projects in our Downstream portfolio progressed consistent with our plans. ","These projects have all been tested against the margin environment we saw in 2019 and all would be earnings and cash accretive. ","In our Chemical business, eight of our 13 growth facilities are online and we reached final investment decisions on another four last year, which again remain attractive even when tested against the 2019 market environment. ","Across the board, we remain extremely confident in the value of our project portfolio. Each project leverages our competitive advantages and is underpinned by growing demand, which is shown on the next chart. Demand fundamentals remain strong, supported by a growing population, economic expansion and higher standards of living. ","You can see these fundamentals reflected in historical growth in demand for the energy and products that we provide including demand growth in 2019. Of course, growing demand is only part of the equation. In our business, large capacity additions can come online in overwhelmed growth in demand in the short-term which pushes margins down. ","That\u2019s the story of 2019 and it\u2019s built into the planning basis for our projects. Our investment strategy builds on long-term fundamentals, leverages our competitive advantages and delivers projects robust to down cycles. This will structurally improve Exxon Mobil\u2019s capacity to generate earnings and cash flow, which we laid out at last year\u2019s Investor Day. ","This approach has resulted on our most attractive investment portfolio since the merger 20 years ago. This also generated a portfolio with an average return of 20%. We\u2019ve seen no market developments over the course of 2019 that have changed this. ","However, we are using the 2019 price environment to challenge ourselves to further optimize the portfolio and drive greater efficiencies. But we expect to benefit from this effort. It hasn\u2019t led us to change our 2020 CapEx guidance. Our projects remain advantaged and the economics are robust industry price cycles. ","Let me use our most recent startups to demonstrate this starting in the Downstream and Chemical. Leveraging the capabilities of our organization, our scale and our technology are essential in developing industry-leading projects. But the benefits are only realized when executed efficiently, another Exxon Mobil strength. ","You may recall that we shared a version of the chart on the left during our Investor Day. The grey area represents our estimate of the net cash margin for every refinery in the world at 2019 prices. The blue line represents our Rotterdam refiner prior to our recent investment. ","Second line represents the yield improvement we executed with the first ever deployment of the processing catalyst that we developed. This final line is what we actually realized after a year of run time, no different than what we\u2019ve planned. ","Now, this would be expected for an industry standard proven technology. However, it\u2019s a significant accomplishment for a new to the world technology, one that\u2019s significantly improved Rotterdam\u2019s earnings last year. ","This next line shows the Antwerp margin before our coker investment. Next, we show the expected margin improvement assumed in the project basis. Finally, the actual margin improvement. As you can see, the project is performing better than expected in a very low margin environment. ","The Beaumont polyethylene expansion started up ahead of schedule and it\u2019s exceeding design rates by 5%, while the new Baytown steam cracker and polyethylene lines are operating 10% above design rates. ","Combined, these projects contributed over $600 million in 2019\u2019s very low margin environment. The markets recover, their contributions will be even more significant. Bottom-line of this chart, we delivered these investments in line with our commitments. They are meeting or exceeding expectations and they are adding value in extremely challenging market conditions. ","Let me turn to the Upstream in Guyana. Reaching first oil Guyana was a major achievement for all stakeholders and it is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication by the people of Guyana and our project team. First oil was achieved ahead of schedule, but five years faster than the average timeline for the industry and at an industry-leading development cost. ","Liza phase 1 will continue to ramp up production to 120,000 barrels a day over the next couple of months, while Liza phase 2 is progressing well with the startup in early 2022 in line with our commitments and at the leading edge of industry. ","Chart on the left provides a perspective on industry cost and schedule. We are continuing to work with the government towards FID at Phase 3 Payara, with its targeted startup in 2023. Looking more broadly, as I have already mentioned, we\u2019ve increased the estimated recoverable resource from the Stabroek Block to more than 8 billion barrels, an increase of 2 billion oil equivalent barrels. ","We\u2019ve now had 16 successful wells out of 18 drilled including our recently announced discoveries at Mako and Uaru. Resource size across these 16 successful wells equates to an average of more than 500 million barrels per discovery or the equivalent of a giant for each discovery. ","We recently brought in a fourth drill ship to the basin and are making plans for a fifth. Significant potential remains beyond the first few phases as we move to test Kaieteur and Canje Blocks to the north and east to Stabroek. ","Increasing the scope of our exploration activity, and development and appraisal drilling when costs are low relative to recent years enables us to increase the value of this substantial resource, which is good news for the country, for the investors. ","Let me turn now to another major growth play, our integrated Permian development, which made significant progress in 2019, again in line with our commitments. Let me start by saying that we are still in the relatively early days of this development, particularly in the Delaware Basin. For perspective, we\u2019ve developed roughly 20% of our resource in the Midland and only around 3% of our resource in the Delaware. ","We are continuing to learn as we delineate and develop this resource. Having said this, we are making very good progress. Production for the year increased by 120,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or nearly 80% relative to 2018. As we\u2019ve said previously, our development program is driven by balancing production rates, resource recovery and capital efficiency to maximize value. ","We are seeing continued improvements in drilling and completions, significantly improving cost, while our Delaware well performance is at the leading edge of industry. We are continuously optimizing our cube development drilling and our subsurface technology is enabling us to tailor well spacing which is resulting in higher production, improved recovery and capital efficiencies. ","Last year, we made considerable investments in aboveground compression, separation in logistics infrastructure. This not only supports the current drilling program which is building cost-efficient infrastructure for future drilling. This follows the comprehensive development plan that we laid out last March and captures the capital efficiency of scale of development. ","I noted Neil Chapman and his team are excited by the potential and are looking forward to discussing the magnitude of the improvements we're seeing at our upcoming Investor Day. I do want to touch briefly on our expectations for 2020, though again, we will have more detail in March. ","As I mentioned before, Our Guyana Phase 1 ramp up and Phase 2 construction will continue and we will broaden our exploration efforts as we work through the considerable, undrilled potential in the basin with five additional wells planned. ","We expect to make considerable progress in the Permian with the completion of the Cowboy Center delivery point, execution of the first large-scale cube development, and volumes growth of 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by year-end. ","We are anticipating FID for the next wave of our major growth projects including Guyana Phase 3 in Brazil. We are also planning for significant exploration activity over the next two years in Brazil. We began to test the tremendous potential of our acreage position. ","In the Downstream, our recent project startups will capitalize on the margin uplift associated with higher value products and coming off of a year of significant scheduled maintenance, we expect higher refinery utilization in 2020. ","In the Chemical business, we will continue to grow sales of performance products and even with the near-term margin pressures, we expect our recent project startups will continue to deliver earnings and generate positive cash. ","Across the corporation, we will maintain a sharp focus on improving our base businesses, driving efficiencies and optimizing the value of our investment portfolio. We will continue to actively market less strategic assets in an effort to high grade our portfolio through value accretive divestments. And of course, we will continue to leverage the key competitive advantage of our financial capacity, capture industry-leading value across the price cycles. ","Given the attractiveness of our organic investment opportunities, this was an important advantage last year. As you can in this chart, as the margins in the Downstream and Chemical business dropped to historic lows, we utilized our financial capacity to fund projects that improved our competitiveness positioned us to capture the eventual upswing. ","With this, our leverage increased slightly during the year, but remains well below our peer group in the broader energy sector. To give you a sense of our scale advantage, 1% of incremental leverage equates to about $4 billion in additional debt. ","While our financial capacity is an important advantage, it\u2019s one we use very thoughtfully, given the volatility of our industry and the opportunity to come with it, we strive to maintain a significant buffer to preserve optionality. ","Now before I hand it back to Neil, I\u2019ll offer a few closing thoughts. As we\u2019ve demonstrated over the past two years, we are committed to delivering on our investment plans and high grading our asset portfolio to strengthen the earnings and cash generation of our business across the broad range of price environments. We have a very rich set of investment opportunities and as we work to develop these opportunities, we remain focused on optimizing total value over the long-term. ","2019 price and margin environment, we have increased our efforts to drive further capital efficiency and optimize pace without compromising value. We will remain thoughtful in utilizing our financial capacity, but we will take full advantage of it to capture value-accretive opportunities without compromising our flexibility. ","Finally, we will continue to focus on improving our base business and driving efficiencies across the entire corporation. ","With that, I will hand things back to Neil. ","Neil Hansen ","Okay. Thank you for your comments, Darren. We will now be happy to take any questions you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","We will take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, and Darren, again we appreciate you jump on the call and doing these with us. So, I guess, my first question is around, the capital spend and so, I think what you are signaling is capital spend in line with the prior guidance, which if I remember was $33 billion to $35 billion. ","And can you just talk about the framework if the environment stays challenging especially across Downstream and Gas. Is there downward flex on that spend? Or is the Exxon framework that you spend through the cycle with the long-term orientation? ","Darren Woods ","So, good morning, Neil and thanks for your comments. Yes, so as I said, we at we have with the price environment and cash the draw really taken advantage of some of the organizational changes that we made last year. We formed a corporate-wide projects organization bringing together the experience and capability in that space into one organization that can then be deployed across our of the entire asset portfolio. ","The Upstream reorganization has given us a real good line of sight across the businesses, one that wasn't as clear in the past with the functional organization. So we're using those changes to take a real hard look at the opportunities we got. Of course the Chemicals and Downstream business is doing the same thing in looking for additional efficiencies to shape that portfolio. ","We are also looking at options to pace and to move projects around and out if we can do that without compromising the long-term value that we built those projects on the basis that we built those projects on. So, I think there is opportunity in that space. And if we continue to see very low margins and cash for all that we want to address, we got optionality to do that. ","We can move some things out and we can also slow down the pace in the Permian. We don't want to compromise the scale of the development in the Permian. So we are \u2013 there is a balance to be struck there. But we\u2019ve got optionality and I think, as we go through the year to come, we will keep a real close eye on kind of how the market develops and then keep a hand on the lever to make sure that we make adjustments as we need to. ","I think it\u2019s one of the great advantages of having a very large portfolio. We\u2019ve got lots of optionality here. And so, I think we are comfortable with it and the one criteria is that we won't \u2013 we may defer some value capture. But we are not going to - we don't want to eliminate or pass up any value capture. ","Neil Mehta ","That\u2019s very clear. And then just a follow-up on your comments on the Permian. We\u2019re looking at the red line versus sort that the green bars if you will on the Permian slide and it\u2019s hard to extrapolate how much quarter-to-quarter. But the production was a little bit more flat Q4 versus Q3. Is that just the timing of completions associated with the cube design? ","And should we expect that acceleration at some point earlier this year? And then just how do you think about Midland versus Delaware? I think one of the comments that was made on those conference calls a couple of quarters ago was that, Midland has gone really well, but Delaware is not performing as well as you would like on the drilling side. So any color there would be helpful. ","Darren Woods ","Yes, I think with respect to the first points you made around, difficult to extrapolating for any one quarter is exactly right. I think when we introduced that end and Neil Chapman talked about it. We said it wasn't going to be a smooth development and that we would see a lumpy progress with respect to the volume\u2019s growth. So I don't - I would draw whole lot. ","We\u2019re not - we haven't seen anything in that development which would suggest anything other than continuing on that path. But again, it will be lumpy and I think if you look back at that red line, you'll see that lumpiness has been playing out historically. So, and I think you see that we continue to go forward.","I think, a really important point, if you look at the volumes that we delivered in the Permian, we\u2019re above what we said we were going to do last year at the Investor Day by about 20,000 barrels a day. So, that's clearly on track. ","With respect to the Permian and the Delaware, of course as I said the Delaware is much earlier in its development cycle. The organization continues to learn as we\u2019re going through that development. I would tell you, we are making really good progress in what we\u2019re seeing there. Neil did talk about Delaware being more difficult than the Midland. ","But I would also say, again, another advantage of the reorganization that we did last year in bringing kind of the best of Exxon Mobil with the best of our XTO organization into this space is that we\u2019re making really, really good progress with respect to that. And like what we\u2019re seeing and as I said, I tell it to guys and you are real \u2013 we are excited by the potential here. ","And I know they're anxious to spend some time in March taking you through some of the proof points of that. But I would tell you, we like what we are seeing in the Delaware and while it is different than the Midland nothing to suggest that that the opportunity there is not as great, if not better frankly. ","Neil Mehta ","Thanks very much, Darren, ","Darren Woods ","Sure, Neil. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. ","Jon Rigby ","Thank you Neil and Darren. I just wanted to go to \u2013 I think, the fourth bullet point on your key message. You do flagged up driving efficiencies and improving the base business and although I think a lot of the focus does fall on your investment program, I mean, you need to fund it and it seems to me the evidence that there may have been some shortfalls in generating the earnings and cash in the base business to fund that investment. ","Is that a fair observation? It\u2019s difficult to disaggregate underlying performance from the cyclical conditions, but are you able to sort of identify where there have been some unexpected shortfalls? And whether there are business improvement plans, et cetera to go after changing that into 2020? ","Darren Woods ","Yes. Thank you, Jon. Good morning. Just on that with respect to the shortfalls, as I said in my prepared comments, it's really a function of the margin environment that we\u2019ve seen out there and the sectors that we've invested in terms of our production capacity and the configuration of that capacity. ","As you look around different the Chemical businesses and Downstream businesses, what you typically see quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year and the big drivers of change in movement is how the margins vary and impact each of the configurations in the investment. ","So, as an example, as Neil Hansen mentioned, we have liquids cracking in the Chemical business in the quarter of the charts that he showed that was clearly had - clearly had an impact on the quarter. And so there is a lot of structural change and so we look across the businesses that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re seeing is the spreads that have changed across both Chemical and Downstream business given our configuration has impacted us. ","That doesn\u2019t worry us particularly. In fact, if you go back in time and Chemical that configuration was very attractive and made us really good money over a number of years. We've had some significant investments in that space here recently, which has created this imbalance in supply and demand. But the business is growing fast and we will come out of that. ","And so, we expect to see the Chemical business and our base business return to where it was in the past as that the demand growth continues and that excess supply capacity is coming down. Don\u2019t forget too in the Downstream, significant turnaround here last year. As Neil said, highest level of turnarounds been in the last 15 years. ","So, a lot of capacity was off - online last year. You can\u2019t overcome capacity to shut down. So this year, we are back to more normal levels. We should see the business return to where it\u2019s at. So, and I think, as you couple that low environment with some of the growth projects of that we\u2019ve got in place and the expenses that come with that, you see the impact with that. ","But beyond that, I think the business is running sound. We\u2019ve always had a focus on efficiencies and becoming better operators that's and we find a margins environments like this, it just sharpened that focus and makes it even clear to the organization why that is so important. ","And so that\u2019s what I referenced. I would tell you our folks are motivated to roll their sleeves up and dig deep and hard and support the growth plans that we\u2019ve got going forward. I think the final point I'd make there just in terms of our operations and execution, you don\u2019t look much further in the projects and the points I tried to make and what we delivered across our entire portfolio, that was in Refining, that was in Chemical and that was in the Upstream. ","The things we talked about two years ago, very large projects basically delivered as we said and working as we said. So, that\u2019s significant and I would just again reemphasize the project in Rotterdam which was a brand new technology and process. ","Never before implemented in a refinery around the world. We brought that on, came up into operating today exactly as designed. That\u2019s a pretty astounding accomplishment that I don\u2019t think any of our competitors could make today. ","Jon Rigby ","Right. Good. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned FID for Guyana in Brazil in 2020, so could we expect Mozambique as well at some point in the year? ","Darren Woods ","Yes, Mozambique, we are working with our partners on. We are making progress with respect to that. But I would think, as we make progress, we will FID that when we get to the right stage. I think right now, we are working towards a timeline that would give us production somewhere back in 2025, something like that. ","Jon Rigby ","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Darren Woods ","You bet. Thanks, Jon. ","Operator","Next we will go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. ","Doug Terreson ","Good morning everybody. Declining dispersion of return to capital for the big oils suggest that competitive advantages may be converging between the different industry players over 5 to 10 years and on this point, you guys have historically indicated and I think you did a few minutes ago, the technology and scale and integration were key advantages that differentiated Exxon Mobil and lead to value creation over a longer term period. ","So my question is whether this premise is still as valid in your view meaning why your portfolio of opportunities is arguably the best in the peer group, maybe the strongest in a long time. Are you still as confident as you ever about the strength of your competitive advantages and the returns profile and results have proved this overtime? Or has it changed? And if it has changed, which area is becoming more difficult to defend? ","Darren Woods ","Yes. Thanks, Doug, I appreciate the question. Obviously competition always makes this a challenging area and you\u2019ve got to continue to innovate you want to try to maintain a premium above and beyond what the rest of competition is doing and we remain convinced that that premium will be driven by technology and technology developments. ","And I would also tell you we\u2019re convinced that that premium will be earned through our other competitive advantages. I\u2019ll talk a lot about the project execution that we\u2019ve got in place. I think that is a huge competitive advantage. So, I continue to believe that we will have returns on capital employed that are higher than our competitors driven by those advantages. ","I think you got to step back and look at that over a broader timeline. If you look at where we are at today and investments that we\u2019re making, those projects are very accretive and very high returns, but we are in the early stages of the capital without realizing the benefits of those. And so I think, as you go through time, you are going to see that move in any one year, but over the longer cycle, you are going to see the advantages of those begin to accrue. ","I mean, look at what we are doing in Guyana and the comments that I made around the discoveries. Enormous amount of resources that the organization has found and are bringing on with leading edge developments. That's got to drive better returns. I mean, the chart that we've showed demonstrates that. Look at what we are doing in the Downstream business. Historically, a low-margin, low-return business. ","One of the reasons why we haven't invested heavily in that business in the past is we couldn't find advantaged investments to change that yield profile. With the breakthroughs that we've had in some of our process technology work and catalyst, we are now unlocking some of that as you've seen with Rotterdam. ","Again, there is technology that's giving us an upgrade in value at a capital cost much lower than what the rest of industry could achieve. We are taking that same process technology into Singapore and upgrading even lower value streams to higher value products, So, again at a lower capital cost. We are going to see those are higher returns and if you look at the - on the Chemical side, we are very focused and the investments we are making are all driven by performance products. ","You start with large-scale facilities. You fill them initially with commodity and then you grow performance products and eventually those products \u2013 those plants switch over to all performance products. And so again, a higher return. So each one of the businesses, we have a clear line of sight of how we gain advantage across competition and the question is when will those manifest themselves. ","It will be, one, a function of where we are at in that investment versus production cycle and where the \u2013 any one years, those margins are at. But ultimately, I don't see a change in the recipe or the dynamics that would change where we've been historically.","Doug Terreson ","Okay. And then also, the integrated business model has been the most productive model in the energy sector for several decades, although I guess, changes to competitive structure could always change that in the future. So, consistent with the points I think you just made about technology and execution, multinational experience et cetera, do you still consider the integrated model to be optimal? ","And the one that holds the greatest potential for superior returns and shareholder outcomes? And also Darren, has your thinking changed any on this topic over the past several years?","Darren Woods ","I would tell you I still believe this is an area of value and the only change in my thinking is, how much more potential there is to be realized in that process. I think you are aware, Doug, that we brought the entire organization together on the Houston campus starting in 2014. First time in the history of our company, where we had all of our businesses on one location, which allows those organizations to continue to explore and look for synergies. ","And I would tell you that we are in the early stages of finding a lot of significant opportunities. The projects organization is a great example of that. First time in our history that we had our Upstream, Chemical and our Downstream projects organization together and a lot of opportunities to take advantage of each of the strengths of those organizations applied to the other parts of the organization. ","So we like what we are seeing there. I'd tell you, if you want to look to a concrete example of what integration has brought to the company, look no further than the logistics that we started investing in to connect our Upstream developments with our Downstream and Chemical assets. ","In 2018, as the differentials opened up, we made $1.8 billion on that disconnect, which I think only an integrated company could capture. And that comes and goes and as we talked about in 2019, those differentials weren't there. But we anticipate that they will be back. ","And the final point I would make with integration, if you look at what we are doing in the Permian and the investments that we are making in Chemical and Refining, those are geared toward the barrels coming out of the Permian and some of the opportunities we see with those barrels. That would have been hard to do if we were a standalone Downstream company or a standalone Upstream company. ","So, only having both of those and being able to understand what's happening in each of those areas that you can find some unique value. So, I am convinced we have a lot more advantages to bring to the table that over time begin to manifest themselves as we continue to exercise the organizations that we've put in place down at the campus.","Doug Terreson ","Yes. It sounds like the case is as strong as ever at least for you guys. And thanks again for joining us, Darren.","Darren Woods ","You bet, Doug. Nice talking with you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read ","Yes. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the call, Darren.","Darren Woods ","Good morning.","Roger Read ","I guess, so much of what we've heard from Exxon and from some of your peers is, it's definitely an unfavorable - call it, I guess, generally cyclical downturn here across all the various pieces. But the one area I was kind of curious about and is as weak as anything else seems to be on the global gas side. You are one of the major players in the LNG markets. ","You've got several different locations where you are looking to expand over the next couple of years. I was just curious how you see that sort of playing its way out. And whether or not there are any issues on the demand side there.","Darren Woods ","Yes, I would \u2013 you look at, I think, separate out maybe the LNG business with domestic gas business, those have some slightly different dynamics associated with them. Overall, continuing to see very good growth in the gas business. LNG, I think we are seeing and projecting about 4% growth, annual growth in LNG. ","I think both stories, both domestic and LNG is, again, it's very similar to the discussions that we are having in the Downstream and Chemicals, which is fairly solid and good growth. But we are seeing short-term oversupply and therefore lower margins and our expectation is that that demand will continue to grow in part driven by concerns of climate change and replacing coal for gas. ","But also, just as economies grow and people's standards of living grow, and more power is needed, gas is a very reliable and secure source of supply for power generation. So I think that dynamic is going to continue to happen. I think the LNG oversupply over time will work itself out. And I think investments in that space will probably slow and eventually the demand will catch up to the supply and things will improve. ","Again, it's the same dynamic of capital-intensive, long cycle investments and as those come on to the market, adjusts - and compared to demand, it just takes some time for those two to reach in balance. But you typically see that and I don't think that that dynamic is going to change. ","That's why, of course, we are very focused as we look at these investments of making sure that as you look across the global supply curve that we are on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, that the projects that we are investing in will have advantages and be lower cost than the broader industry and competition, so that as that oversupply impacts margins. ","We are on that left-hand side and can see - still see advantages to having those investments. Yes, the same dynamic that I've talked about in our Downstream and Chemical investments. The large investments that we've brought online and yet, we are making money in bottom of cycle conditions, why? Because they were advantaged and we wouldn't invest in those until we found a way to get them advantaged. Same is true in the LNG business.","Roger Read ","Great, thanks and then, kind of along the lines of some of the other things you've talked about on potential for deferring CapEx if needed to keep things in balance. As we think about the dividend growth and I know you can't give us the number, whatever it goes to the Board. ","But how should we think about dividend growth in a kind of cash flow constrained environment with the larger commitment here to the CapEx side?","Darren Woods ","Well, I think as I've talked about before, and as we look at the business from a macro standpoint in allocation of capital. We start with in order for this business to maintain a long-term value proposition. We have to continue to invest and we have to continue to develop projects and opportunities that are advantaged versus industry. ","So that's a priority making sure that we invest in this capital too and certainly in the Upstream to offset the depletion that we know occurs in both the crude and gas side of the house. And in the Downstream, making sure that we are using technology to improve the yields as society's demand patterns change and those yield profiles change on a barrel of crude. ","And then, in Chemical is to keep up with the pace of high performance products that meet the needs of growing economies and populations where their standards of living are improving. And so, that's kind of job number one and we got to make sure that we continue to do that to keep pace and to have a long kind of prosperous business as we look into the future. ","We also feel very firmly that we've got a commitment with our shareholders to provide a reliable and growing dividend. So we would continue to look to do that and ride through these price cycles. Given the strength of the long-term fundamentals, we think that's an appropriate thing to do. And so, we would look to continue that trend of steady and reliable growth. ","And then, of course, it\u2019s maintaining the balance sheet and our financial capacity with where it needs to be to ride through these cycles and to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in the down cycles. And then to also mitigate and manage the volatility that we've seen and recently experienced. So, that's kind of as we think about it the primary criteria for how we use cash. ","And at the end of the day, we met our criteria and we've got additional cash and then we go into buybacks and return excess cash to the shareholders. That's been the model for a long time. And I would tell you that that model remains pretty effective as we think about what we need to do in this business.","Roger Read ","Thank you.","Darren Woods ","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan.","Phil Gresh ","Hi, Darren. Thanks for taking my question. And so, as we look at where you are on the asset sale plan, you talked about $15 billion over three years, $25 billion longer-term. There has been some reports out talking about maybe the plan is moving faster than that in terms of the three year plan. ","So, I just want to get your latest thoughts as to, relative to the risks of plan that you laid out there, how you are feeling about that now? And in terms of - if it does come in better, is the first use of asset sale proceeds basically going to be to fund any dividend coverage gap to this investment phase if we're at the bottom of the cycle here again in 2020 or to your point on buybacks, is that even in the cards in that type of scenario. Thanks.","Darren Woods ","Sure, Phil. Good morning to you. I would tell you, as we introduce the divestment program, and Neil Chapman talked about that last year, we always said it was a risk program and the intention was to put we would have more assets out because we didn't expect to transact on all of those opportunities. And so, I think the reports that you are seeing reflect the fact that there are - we are looking \u2013 we've got a number of assets out in the marketplace today. ","Again, we don't expect to transact on all of those and so we've made some risking in judgment. And whether or not, we exceed the numbers that we've talked about or in fact fall below this will be a function of the buyers and the deal space we find with those buyers. ","Clearly, last year, we found an opportunity where a buyer had saw a value \u2013 a higher value than we thought we could realize with our Norway asset that resulted in a transaction. I think a win-win for both of us. If we find more of those, more than we have anticipated, then I think we'll be above.","On the other hand, we've had deals that we've worked and couldn't find the deal space and didn't transact. So, and that was the point I'm trying to make in my comments. This is really around a portfolio of high-grade and the only way I can convince myself that we are upgrading the portfolio is if we realize the value for an asset that's higher than what we think we can realize by keeping it in our portfolio. ","And so, I would just tell you, how fast that goes and how far we go is really going to be a function of the buyers and the opportunities that we find. And we're going to look at it that way. I am not \u2013 while we try to estimate what we think we'll bring in, I am not going to sacrifice the value proposition to hit any particular number and I am not going to pace it, I am not going to worry about the pacing as much as I am around the value proposition associated with it.","And then, with respect to the proceeds, as I mentioned when we rolled this out, it's all really a function of the broader environment. If we see margins improve in our businesses. If we see prices rise in the Upstream and we bring in more revenue, we'll look at those balances. We certainly want to keep our projects funded. ","We are going to continue to grow reliable dividends. So those are going to be the first calls on that cash and then we are going to make sure that we keep the balance sheet whole and where we need it to be. And so I think, those will be the priorities and at the end of the day, we'll see where we are at with that and make decisions on buyback after it.","Phil Gresh ","Sure. Okay. Second question, just, I think, probably the standard one we ask every quarter. But just, it seems like the energy sector valuations continue to deteriorate here at least for the public companies we are looking on our screen. ","So, from your perspective, is this an environment where you think valuations are getting more compelling to you in terms of potential M&A opportunities? Or just how do you think about that today? Thanks.","Darren Woods ","Yes. Thanks Phil. I think you know, well, first I would say, I believe that the highest value opportunities are the ones that you can generate organically because almost by definition, you are not paying a premium for them. And so I think, we've got a really attractive portfolio as we've talked about and that's what anything that we do has to compete against is those organic opportunities. ","And so, that's my starting point and then, we look to see if there are opportunities out there that we can transact on that compete or are better than those organic opportunities. And while the short-term market fluctuations are moving around, and you see that valuation change, obviously, the ability to capture that will be a function of people who are in the market selling and their longer term views of their business and whether or not what position they are in and whether they are forced to take the current valuations or whether they think longer-term and look at the value somewhat differently. ","So I think again, it's kind of a difficult to talk about generically. It will be a very specific case-by-case basis. We - just as we are active in the divestment side of the house and have got assets that we're out there marketing, we keep a very firm finger on the pulse of the industry and the opportunities and keep our eyes open for opportunities that could bring additional value to the company.","Phil Gresh ","Okay. Thanks.","Darren Woods ","You bet. Good talking to you, Phil.","Operator","And next we'll go to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.","Biraj Borkhataria ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a question going back to the financial capacity. The numbers you referenced in your chart, I think were net debt-to-market cap, what we normally kind of look at is, either net debt-to-capital employed or net debt-to-cash flow. When I think about the capital employed number or the equity, I guess, investors need to be confident in the value of equity. ","And what we've seen in the last year or so, as a number of your peers announced impairments due to lower price decks. So could you \u2013 are you willing to share what price deck you are using for oil and gas to test for impairments? That would be my first question.","Darren Woods ","Yes, thanks Biraj. We don't typically put out a price deck and I wouldn't \u2013 I don't have any desire to kind of start doing that. Let me maybe tell you a little bit about how we think about pricing going forward. And the first thing I would say is, I don't think any of our peers and certainly within ExxonMobil, we feel like we can predict prices. ","I think there are just way too many variables involved. Too many developments that occur over time to really, I think, get firm handles on where short-term prices are going to go. What we do, do though is looking forward in the future and we start with kind of building up what I would say is a very fundamental approach to what will drive oil and gas demand, which comes back to economic growth and policies and all of those assumptions and how we think about how the world will evolve with respect to our industry. ","We publish in our energy outlook. So if you're interested in understanding what's driving our pricing assumptions, I would start with our energy outlook, because that forms the basis of everything that we do with respect to how we think about the future and how we make investment decisions. ","Again since that's our basis and then, since our business is commodity, we continue to believe that in the medium to long-term that market prices will be set by the marginal \u2013 the cost and return criteria of the marginal barrel that's needed to meet that demand. And so, it's classic economic supply and demand, marginal producer sets the market price. ","We try to take a kind of a high-level view of that. What will be the resources that come on and meet that last barrel of demand? And that is the view that we take around what will kind of be the price-setting mechanisms in the market. And of course, that evolves over time. And that's what sets generally our price outlook is, the economic and the demand side of the equation including advances in technology, including additional regulations in policy around the world. ","And then we look at where technology could go and what supply sources will come on and what we will set the kind of the cost of supply, and then set our pricing. When we finish that exercise, we step back and compare our view with other published views, third-party reviews and check for reasonableness to the extent that other companies publish their numbers we look and compare to make sure that our estimates at least appear reasonable. ","And generally they are always within the range, maybe perhaps on the low side of what we typically see out there. But that's how we do it. And you can imagine that process does not lead to huge changes year-on-year, simply because, the fundamentals that I referred to don't dramatically change year-on-year. They do evolve obviously. ","Certainly, if you think about the tight gas or the shale revolution, that was an evolving and developing story. And that obviously had impacts on the marginal tiers of supply, which had impacts on pricing. But that has been kind of an evolution that's been built into the price deck over the years and it\u2019s pretty constant now. ","So, that's how we do it and that's how we think about it and then we make our investment decisions based on that. And then test really on the low side and the high side to make sure that the investments that we are putting in place are robust to cycles that we know we are going to see.","Biraj Borkhataria ","Okay, noted. The second question, I just wonder if you could give us an update on Papua New Guinea. And there were some article this morning about negotiations with the government not going according to plan for the expansions. Could you update us on where that project is? And what that means to the FID?","Darren Woods ","Sure. Let me just start with maybe the bigger picture of Papua New Guinea. Obviously, we are the operator of the PNG LNG project, which was a $19 billion project. It's brought employment to about 3,200 people in Papua New Guinea. Since 2010, we've spent about over $4 billion on Papua New Guinean services including about $2 billion spent with the landowner companies. ","We've invested almost $300 million in community and infrastructure programs focused on education, health, women's empowerment, a number of other areas. So, the established business that we have there I think has been a real benefit to Papua New Guinea and obviously, a benefit for us. We are looking at this expansion and we are looking at bringing in the Papua project with Total, along with P'Nyang and have been in negotiations with the government. ","We are disappointed here recently that we weren't able to reach agreement with the government on P'Nyang. But we are very hopeful that those discussions can move forward and continue. I think, from our perspective, we've got to find a way to get to a win-win proposition. ","We've got our big portfolio of opportunities as I've been referring to here this morning and anything that we decide to FID and move forward has to compete within that portfolio. So, that's the basis on which we are looking at this negotiation and working with the government. Need to be a win-win. I think we'll continue to try to establish that with the government. ","But I also think we've got some time given all the other opportunities in front of us. And frankly, given where we are at today in the supply demand balance of LNG, I think we can - we've got time to work it with the government and I am hopeful and I am fairly confident that at some point we'll find a way forward with them.","Biraj Borkhataria ","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai ","Hi, good morning everyone.","Darren Woods ","Good morning, Jeanine.","Neil Hansen ","Good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai ","So, I guess my first question is on the Permian and it\u2019s dovetailing off of Neil's question. And then specifically on the rig count. So can you provide a little more color on how operations are going? And if there is any change in the number of rigs you see required to make the 1 million barrels a day that you laid out earlier? ","So, when we look at the data, the rig count has been trending flat to down over the past six months. And I know that the rig counts can be pretty deceiving, given improving efficiencies and all. But have you encountered anything unexpected in particular, we're referring to the subsurface in the Delaware?","Darren Woods ","Yes, let me - I'll talk high-level. First of all, I am not a big believer in extrapolating rig counts into kind of what we are doing in the business and the approach that we are taking and the progress we are making in the development. I think it's a fairly crude measure, particularly for the work that we have been doing there. ","As you recall, what we laid out in the Permian and particularly in the Delaware was a large-scale approach, which is \u2013 which was unique to industry that leverages the scale that we have as a corporation, leverages the technology, some of the resources that we have within the company. And we have been developing the tools to model and develop that resource that we think is pretty unique in the industry. ","We've used a lot of rigs to help delineate what we are doing in that space. And as we collect that information, build those models and optimize, I think you're going to see movements around what we are doing there. So, I would not again take too much - draw too many conclusions from strictly speaking the rig count.","And with respect to that work that we've been doing, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we feel really good about the progress that we're making and seeing significant improvements in the initial production across 365 days and longer. We like what we are seeing with the recovery rates. We like what we're seeing with the D&C costs and those are coming down. ","And we like what we see around some of the well performance, particularly in the Delaware. I think if you look at the results that we are getting, we are leading industry, I think it's fair to say. So, good progress there and it's just really a question of how we want to continue going forward and pace that. And I know that Neil and his team are looking at that in light of the environments that we've come out of in 2019. ","And when we get to March, I think the folks will spend some time kind of sharing some of the proof points, some of the data with you to help you get a better picture of that. And then we'll talk more about kind of how we see the path going forward here. But bottom-line, the potential of that and the value propositions that we've talked about haven't changed, if anything, we like it better.","Jeanine Wai ","Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. ","Darren Woods ","Thank you.","Jeanine Wai ","And then, just switching gears here quickly, as far as the light-sweet, heavy-sour spreads being slower than expected to adjust and the crude discounts maybe not being at full parity with the product pricing, you indicated in your prepared remarks that ultimately you expect these issues to improve or reverse. And so my question is, could this be a potential tailwind for as early as 1Q? ","And any additional comments you have on just timing and how you see that developing would be really helpful. Thank you.","Darren Woods ","Sure. I don't \u2013 when you say it\u2019s developing slower than predicted, I don't know that we ever had a real firm prediction on how this is going to play out. I mean, the markets have got a lot of variables that go into it. This was a known event that was going to happen. And so, a lot of different players, a very fragmented market, lots of different actions with storage and inventory. ","And so, I think really difficult to predict exactly how all those variables and all those independent actions come together and results in what we're seeing in the marketplace. I can tell you, what you see is explainable. You can certainly put a rationale behind how long it takes to play out and get back to what we think eventually will be more market parity. ","I think it's really a function of where the different inventories and how people are choosing to optimize around the new requirements with respect IMO. The reason why we are convinced that eventually we'll get back to parity is because the fundamentals associated with IMO are pretty clear and the kind of the economics of refining aren't real hard to figure out. ","As you've taken sulfur out and the valuation of high sulfur feedstocks and products have dropped down, that's got to make itself back into the crude and crudes that are higher sulfur and heavier, they are producing more of those lower value products ultimately have to reflect the fact that their product, the yield profile of that barrel of crude is less attractive. ","So, I think, that's a pretty foundational element of crude markets in refining and eventually those will hold. And then, in the short-term depending on the different actions that folks have taken and what their position is and what moves it did earlier and what inventories look like, it's going to take time to work itself out. ","I would tell you from our perspective, we manage this based on the longer-term fundamentals. We made investments based on the longer-term fundamentals. We didn't make any investments that assumed credit for this transition and the benefits that might come along with it given a particular investment. We just recognized it would come, but the decisions that were made were based on more of the longer-term fundamentals.","Jeanine Wai ","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Darren Woods ","Thank you, Jeanine.","Neil Hansen ","And operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Right. We will take that question from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd ","Okay, thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on some of your comments earlier on the LNG markets. Are you seeing \u2013 can you comment on whether you are seeing any pressure on existing or currently negotiated contracts? And also some of your European peers have been successful in offsetting at least some of the ongoing price weakness and the medium-term price weakness via active portfolio trading globally? ","I believe you've looked to increase those capabilities across your organization globally. Can you maybe talk about progress in that direction? And how you may be able to mitigate medium-term weakness in global LNG prices?","Darren Woods ","Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think, you're right. Your observations are pretty solid in terms of there are opportunities with portfolio trading to try to mitigate some of that shorter-term weakness. And I think, as you look at the markets, you see the market is kind of slowly evolving along those lines. At the same time, a lot of the buyers in LNG market are interested in ensuring long-term deliveries and surety of supply. ","And so, there is still a desire for the longer-term contracts as new projects are FIDed and developed often times a financing requires, secured outlets and terms on that. So, there are a lot of underlying dynamics that keep what I would say is the more traditional longer-term transactions in place. And so, while I think the markets will continue to develop and there'll be more trading on top of that. ","I think there will still be a layer of what I would say is the historical approach to LNG. And that will be a very slow moving transition over time.","With respect to the LNG trading that we have, it's been widely reported and I have talked about it the last time I was on. We have begun looking and moving more into some of the trading as that market evolves. But our intention is to kind of evolve with the needs of the market and that will just become a bigger piece of our business as that becomes a bigger piece of the market and more relevant to the market.","Ryan Todd ","Okay. Perfect, thanks. And then maybe one quick follow-up on Chemicals. Obviously, it's been a tough environment and you talked about the eventual rebalancing from a supply\/demand point of view. Can you talk about, I guess, as we look over the next 12 months to 18 months, what you see maybe in terms of some of the market dynamics and the recovery from that point of view? ","And you highlight in your presentation growth-related expenses of $160 million, at least on a delta basis in the quarter. You have a pretty active growth program. Any help on maybe the direction of magnitude of those growth-related expenses going forward?","Darren Woods ","Yes, sure. I think \u2013 so let me start with your last point around growth-related expenses. I mean, obviously as large capital projects or large manufacturing investments, as you progress those, there are costs come along with them. I think you can think about those growth-related costs in three basic buckets. The first is, as you bring on new investments, so the steam crackers that we\u2019ve brought on, the polyethylene lines that we brought on was different investments that are up and running. ","Obviously, there are costs associated with those new investments and as we first bring those up, we categorize those as growth expenses because they are new facilities and we want to make sure as we look at those, we think about those different than what the basic expenses are since we are driving base cost down. We've got at the same time recognized that more cost will come in from operating new facilities. So that's one bucket. ","Other projects that are in construction. So as an example, our cracker in Corpus Christi area, there are expenses associated with in-progress projects, which is another bucket to think about with growth. That's oftentimes not as large because a lot of the costs associated with that development gets capitalized. But there are expenses to go along with it. So that's within the bucket. ","And then the third growth expense is, as we look at further into the future and look at opportunities and project teams are working, the next project to fill the pipeline further out, that's a growth expense. And so, in the Chemical businesses, that's how you should think about those growth expenses. ","And obviously, we keep a pretty close eye on those and are making sure that as we grow, we are growing as efficiently as possible. But also recognize that activity has to be funded and therefore recognize and accept those expenses.","With respect to the when the cycle and how we see things playing itself out, it's really a function of where growth goes. I mentioned really strong growth in the polyethylene business, the polypropylene business. We continue to see that that. We have to see how the world economies evolve here. China, obviously has got some challenges here in the short-term that may manifest themselves in the quarter. ","So, difficult to see how long and what impact that will have on and where China goes. That's obviously a big player in the Chemical business. Our perspective is, while we are interested and try to look at where that cycle is \u2013 how long that cycle is going to last and where it goes to, we recognize we don't control it. And so, focusing on the things that we can do to make sure that as we are in that down cycle that we are successful by making sure we are running efficiently, keeping our cost down really ensuring that all of our production on the margin is profitable is what the organization is focused on. ","I think this year will continue to be a challenging year for our Chemical business. But I think as we get in the year further out, we will start to see some things improve. And then, it's just the slope of that improvement will be a function of a lot of different things that frankly it's hard to predict that far out. ","I'll come back to you though, we know these cycles are going to happen and we know it's the impact on our business is driven by the sectors that we've chosen to invest in and market in. If you go back in time, those decisions have proven to be very beneficial to the company. And in fact, one of the reasons we find the margins where they are is because that's attracted a lot of additional investment. ","Growth will take us out of that and it's just a function of while we are waiting for that growth to catch -up and exceed that capacity, we got to make sure that we are managing this business as tightly as we can. So that we can stay as profitable as we can.","Ryan Todd ","Okay. Thank you.","Neil Hansen","All right. Thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight our fourth quarter and full year that included a number of key milestones and continued progress across our portfolio. And we look forward to seeing everyone on March 5th at our Investor Day in New York. ","We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 216 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","So before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on slide two.","Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $1.7 billion. Corporation continues to generate cash flow through the business cycle to meet our commitment to shareholders and support investments across the value chain.","In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments by a healthy margin. We are realizing the benefit of strengthening prices in the fourth quarter in our upstream financial results. However these results included a $2 billion impairment charge in the U.S. segment, largely related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountain region. The impairment charge was the result of an asset recoverability study completed during the quarter and is consistent with the approach we took in 2015.","Continued solid performance on our downstream and chemicals segments underscores the resilience of our integrated business throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation continued to progress strategic investments across the upstream, downstream and chemical segments during the year, including execution of major projects, value accretive acquisitions and pursuit of high potential exploration opportunities.","Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained modest during the fourth quarter. In the United States, the pace of economic expansion slowed relative to a stronger third quarter. We have stabilized in China and remain tepid in Europe and Japan despite some improvement in the quarter.","Crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter on anticipation of an improved supply balance as well as colder weather. Refining margins improved in Europe and Asia while seasonal margins in the United States weakened. And finally, chemical margins decreased due to higher feed and energy costs, driven largely by commodity products.","Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed dividends of $3.1 billion to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.8 billion, down 35% from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting ongoing capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $42.8 billion.","The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $5.1 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative adjustment for working capital and other items reflects changes in deferred tax balances.","Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $3.8 billion. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by $4 billion, primarily due to a reduction in short-term debt. Cash flow from operations and asset sales cover dividends and net investments in the quarter by more than $2 billion.","Moving now to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $1.1 billion from a year ago quarter as a result of the impairment charge taken in the U.S. upstream segment. This was partly offset by stronger upstream results and in earnings benefit in the corporate and financing segment as a result of favorable non-U.S. one-time tax items. On average, we expect that near-term corporate and financing expenses will be in the range of $400 million to $600 million per quarter which does represent a reduction relative to our previous guidance.","Similarly in the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $970 million.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago quarter resulting in a loss of $642 million. Higher realizations improved earnings by $510 million driven by higher liquids prices. Crude realizations increased more than $8 per barrel whereas natural gas realizations decreased $0.32 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. And other items added $70 million driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, fourth quarter 2016 upstream earnings totaled $1.4 billion, up $528 million from the prior year quarter.","Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production decreased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year to 4.1 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 97,000 barrels per day as new project growth and more program volumes were more than offset by field decline, entitlement impacts and downtime in Nigeria. Natural gas production decreased to 179 million cubic feet per day as higher demand and project growth were more than offset by decline, regulatory impacts in the Netherlands, entitlement effects and divestments.","Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased $1.3 billion from the third quarter of 2016. Improved realizations increased earnings by $450 million. Crude prices were $4 per barrel higher and natural gas prices were up $0.41 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects contributed $230 million, driven by higher seasonal demand, lower downtime and project growth. Other items increased earnings by $90 million driven by favorable foreign exchange effects.","Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased more than 8% or 310,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production was up 173,000 barrels per day, mainly the result of lower downtime and growth from new projects and work programs. Natural gas production was 823 million cubic feet per day higher than the previous quarter. Stronger seasonal demand in Europe and entitlement effects were partly offset by regulatory impacts in the Netherlands and field decline.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $110 million compared to the fourth of 2015. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $570 million. Favorable volume mix effects mainly from increased operational efficiency and production optimization improved earnings by $200 million. All other items added $260 million, mostly from asset management activities, partly offset by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. In the quarter, Imperial Oil completed the sale of its retail network. The sites are then converted to their branded wholesale distributor model resulting in an earnings benefit of $522 million dollars.","Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings were flat sequentially. Stronger refining margins outside the United States and improved volume mix increased earnings by $160 million and $100 million respectively. All other items reduced earnings by $250 million driven by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects partially offset by asset management gains.","Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $872 million, down $91 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins primarily for specialty products decreased earnings by $10 million while unfavorable volumes and mix effects further reduced earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $50 million largely due to unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects.","Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down almost $300 million sequentially. Weaker margins driven by higher feed and energy costs reduced earnings by $200 million. Higher volumes added $50 million and all other items decreased earnings $150 million including seasonally higher operating expenses and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects.","Turning now to the full year financial results, starting on slide 17. As I mentioned, 2016 earnings totaled $7.8 billion and represents a $1.88 per share. Corporation distributed $12.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx totaled $19.3 billion for the year, a reduction of $11.7 billion versus 2015.","Throughout the year, we maintained a relentless focus on costs, capturing both structural efficiencies and market savings while maintaining operational integrity. These efforts resulted in further reduction in total CapEx and OpEx of $16 billion in the year versus 2015 when excluding the effect of the upstream impairment charge. As a result, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $26.4 billion.","Turning to slide 18. Cash balances were flat to year end 2015 at $3.7billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $26.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative working capital and other impacts for the year were driven by lower upstream payables, deferred tax impacts and cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan. Uses included shareholder distributions of $12.5 billion and net investments of $16.7 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $2.8 billion in the year.","Moving to slide 19. This graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. In a difficult business environment, the corporation continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and asset sales to support the dividend and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a moderate increase in debt financing. We maintain financial flexibility to continue to invest through the cycle in attractive opportunities.","As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $12.5 billion. Annual per share dividends were up 3.5% compared to 2015 and this marks the 3fourth consecutive year of per share dividend growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs. During the year, ExxonMobil generated $9.7 billion of free cash flow, up $3.2 billion from 2015 reflecting the resilience of our integrated businesses and our focus on the fundamentals.","Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. I know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our Analyst Meeting.","Moving on to slide 20 and a review of our full year segment results. 2016 earnings fell $8.3 billion as the impact of lower realizations in margins on our upstream and downstream segments was partially offset by stronger chemical results and lower corporate costs associated with several one-time tax items. As a result, the full year effective tax rate was 30%. Now assuming current commodity prices and the existing portfolio mix, we do anticipate that the effective tax rate will be between 25% and 35% excluding the impact of any large one-time items. On this basis, our full year 2016 effective tax rate was within the new guidance range.","Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results, starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $196 million were $6.9 billion lower than 2015. Realizations reduced earnings by $5.3 billion as crude oil prices decreased over $7 per barrel and natural gas prices declined by $1.40 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million driven by new project growth. All other items added $310 million dollars due to lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, 2016 upstream earnings totaled $2.2 billion.","Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, down about 1% compared to last year but within our full year guidance of four to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production increased 20,000 barrels per day as project and work program growth was partly offset by field decline and higher unplanned downtime, most notably from third-party impacts in Nigeria and wildfires in Canada. Natural gas production, however, decreased 388 million cubic feet per day. Growth in projects and work programs was more than offset field decline, regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and divestments.","The full year comparison for downstream results as shown on slide 23. Earnings were $4.2 billion, a decrease of $2.4billion from 2015. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $3.8 billion. Favorable volume, mix effects increased earnings by $560 million and all other items primarily asset management gains increased earnings by $920 million.","On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2016 earnings were $4.6 billion, up $197 million from 2015. Stronger commodity margins driven by advantage liquids cracking increased earnings $440 million while higher volumes added $100 million. Other items reduced earnings by $340 million reflecting the absence of asset management gains.","Moving next to an update on our upstream project activities. So we continue to deliver on our investment plans with an unwavering focus on long-term value. Five major projects started up in 2016, adding 250 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In the fourth quarter, Kashagan and Gorgon Train 2 started up and like other 2016 projects continue to ramp up to plateau production levels. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on another five major projects that will come online over the next two years. These projects we will together contribute another 340,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity.","Moving now to slide 26. Our focused exploration program continues to enhance our resource portfolio as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. In Guyana, ExxonMobil submitted the development plan for the initial phase of the Liza field. We continue to progress broader development planning activities based on a phased development approach. As part of these activities, contracts were awarded to perform front-end engineering and design. We expect to reach the final investment decision for the project later this year. Additionally, as I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, the Liza-3 appraisal well successfully encountered an additional deeper reservoir which was being evaluated at the time. This reservoir is now estimated to contain 100 to 150 million oil equivalent barrels beneath the Liza field.","Also, offshore Guyana, the Payara exploration well discovered hydrocarbons marking the second discovery on the Stabroek Block. The well encountered more than 95 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Two sidetracks have been drilled to rapidly evaluate the discovery and a well test is about to get underway. The data will be analyzed in the coming months to better understand the full resource potential and development options.","Now, after the Payara well test, the Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Snoek prospect just south of the Liza discovery. ExxonMobil also made two additional discoveries in the fourth quarter including the Nigeria Owowo-3 oil discovery announced in the third quarter earnings call and the Muruk discovery in Papa New Guinea. Both Owowo and Muruk are near currently producing fields which will enable capital efficient development. We also continued to capture new prospective exploration acreage. In Mexico's offshore bid round one, ExxonMobil and Total jointly submitted the apparent high bid for Block 2 located in the Perdido area near the U.S. border. In Cyprus, ExxonMobil and our partner Qatar Petroleum have been selected as the winners of offshore Block 10 in a recent tender round and we look forward to negotiating the production sharing contract for this high potential block. ExxonMobil has also been awarded an offshore prospecting license for exploration activities in the Gulf of Papua in Papua New Guinea. The initial scope of work on this block is expected to include seismic acquisition.","Turning now to slide 27 and an update on ExxonMobil's U.S. unconventional portfolio. As a leading oil and gas producer in the United States, we have a strong acreage position and proven operational expertise in unconventional plays. XTO's daily production is currently more than 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of which 38% is liquids. Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate two-thirds of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11% and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production.","Moving now to slide 28. Our most recent acquisition in the Permian further strengthens our unconventional portfolio adding high quality acreage in the Delaware Basin and more than doubling our resources in the Permian to greater than six billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil agreed to acquire privately owned companies whose holdings include 250,000 net acres of leasehold in the Permian. The acquisition includes an upfront payment $5.6 billion in Exxon Mobil shares plus additional continued cash payments totaling up to $1 billion based on development of the resource over a specified timeframe.","The map on the left shows our heritage acreage in yellow, acreage acquired in transactions in 2014 and 2015 in blue and the acreage associated with the most recent transactions in red. As you can see, the new leasehold represents a significant position in the heart of the Delaware Basin. Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to-date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil equivalent barrels in multiple stacked plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from Upstream Research Company.","We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market leading development costs. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths two miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drill wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017 as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage.","Moving now to slide 29. We continue to strengthen our downstream and chemical business through selected integrated investments in our facilities and operations. We recently completed investments in lubricants and chemical facilities in Louisiana that support our aviation lubricants business commissioning a new state-of-the-art jet oil manufacturing facility in October of last year. The new plant will use Group V synthetic base stocks sourced from facilities that started up last year at our adjacent Baton Rouge chemical plant. Across the fuels, lubricants and chemical value chains, we continued to high grade our portfolio and reduce complexity to efficiently capture market value while reducing operational risk and capital expenditures. In the quarter, we reached agreements to divest several downstream affiliates in Africa and South America.","Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, Imperial Oil completed their conversion of its retail business to a branded wholesaler model. This model benefits from significantly lower capital requirements while continuing to grow retail sales. We also continue to enhance our logistics capabilities by focusing on strategic midstream assets. We recently announced the formation of a joint venture with Sunoco Logistics that will expand access to domestic crude oils by improving transportation options from the Permian and Ardmore basins to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.","In Baytown, at Mont Belvieu, Texas, the construction of our new 1.5 million ton per annum ethane steam cracker and associated metallocene polyethylene facility is progressing well with phase startup commencing in the second half of this year.","Finally, ExxonMobil recently announced a new project at our Beaumont, Texas facility to expand polyethylene capacity by 650,000 tons per year. This expansion amounts to 65% increase in polyethylene capacity at the site. Together, the projects at Beaumont and Mont Belvieu represent multibillion dollar investments that will increase ExxonMobil's U.S. polyethylene production by nearly two million tons per year or 40% making Texas our largest polyethylene supply point. The new facilities will process advantaged ethane feedstock to meet growing global chemical demand.","Moving to the final chart on slide 30. I would like to conclude today's comments with a brief summary of our 2016 performance, which is really underpinned by our sustained focus on value. ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day and maintained focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator.","Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015 as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than cover the dividend and net investments in the business. Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. We are confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to continue to grow long-term value in any business environment. I will discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 1.","That concludes my prepared remarks on a very busy year. And now I would be happy to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Neil.","Neil Mehta","Jeff, I appreciate the incremental disclosure here on the Delaware transaction. That's where I want to start. As you think about that deal, is it indicative of the view that Exxon has that you see more value in, let's say, the private market than the public market? And can you just talk a bit more about the opportunity you see in U.S. unconventional to do deals?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Neil, it's a good question. I would tell you that I would not view it as being exclusive to one type of transaction. As we have talked in the past, we keep a full view on what may be out there that could be competitive with our existing resource base and accretive to overall long-term financial performance. You know, these things don't happen overnight. Several of these take many, many months to go ahead and put in place and not all of them transpire into an executed deal, but what's important is that it is a key aspect of our overall asset management program in order to high grade our portfolio with the view of our underlying mission of growing shareholder value.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, Jeff, is on CapEx. I imagine we are going to get a little bit more color on this at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks, but the $22 billion that you outlined is in line with what you talked about earlier this year, but up from 2016. Can you speak high level to what's driving the growth in 2017 versus 2016 in terms of CapEx? Is that cost inflation? Or is that higher growth? And then bigger picture, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of cost inflation across your portfolio?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Well, Neil, as you indicated, we do plan on giving a lot more detail around our investment plans in the analyst presentation that will be just a little bit more in a month from now. As you indicated, the $22 billion that I mentioned is fairly consistent with our forward-looking plan that we provided a year ago. I would tell you that it does not reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation and in fact the inverse is true is that the organization continues to look for high impact capital efficiencies to drive the cost down and it is, by and large, a function of activity level. Certainly as activity continues to build, we will all experience some market pressures, but that doesn't relieve us of our fundamental objective of maximizing the value proposition and rest assure that the organization will continue to keep focused on what new solutions are there for us to get to a lower cost outcome and the organization is very committed to make sure that we are capturing those and really leading the cost curve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Hi Jeff. Good morning.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Phil.","Phil Gresh","I wanted to start on the working capital and other headwind, $2.4 billion in the quarter, $8 billion for the year. It's a pretty big number. I guess I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate or break that down a little more between deferred taxes and some of the other items? And moving forward how do you think about the ability to lessen that headwind in 2017.","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I mean obviously there's really two large components that are driving it. Obviously the changes in the working capital, by and large, adjustments in receivables and payables due to activity and changes in commodity prices and then the second part of other balance sheet items, some of that associated with deferred taxes. As I said, it also includes cash contributions that we made to the pension plan. So a lot of moving pieces, as is understandable. And I understand the interest, but that's about all the color I have for you at this point.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And then in terms of priorities with cash from here, to the extent you have excess free cash flow above the dividend in 2017, is the first priority, with the trending balances where they are, would it be debt paydown or do you feel like you have flexibility to do other things?","Jeff Woodbury","I think it's a function of the business climate and the opportunities that we have for ourselves. As you have heard us say before, if you think about our capital allocation approach, it's a commitment to provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time continue to selectively invest in our business with opportunities we believe are going to enhance the long-term return of the corporation. The excess cash, by and large, we don't want to hold large cash balances that we don't have immediate need for it. We will think about either paying down debt or buying back shares and that is done primarily on a quarterly basis. The corporation will step back and look at a number of factors like our current financial position, our potential opportunities to put capital to work as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Doug.","Doug Leggate","Jeff, I wonder if I could kick off with your capital guidance. I guess it's kind of a follow-up. But ask you if could you move it on to talk a little bit about the production capacity that you see that goes along with that capital, because I am assuming the Permian is part of it? What I am really driving at is, you have got a number of projects still ramping up, so could you give us some idea as to what the remaining capacity is of those ramp-ups? In other words, what would the delta be if those projects were running full out in 2017? And then I have got a follow-up, please.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Doug, I mean first observation would be is that you are correct that we have projects that started up all the way back to early 2015 that are still well within their development drilling programs are ramping up to plateau production rate. Some of these things could take 12 to 24 months to fully reach the plateau production rate. I don't have a specific number for you as to what is that incremental capacity that's left to ramp up, but I will also highlight that a number of those projects also are exceeding design expectations due to really strong management by the organization around reliability and reservoir performance. We talked about Papa New Guinea in the past, a design at about 6.9, it's now produced above eight million tons per annum. You have heard in the news about Banyu Urip which the development basis was about 165,000 barrels a day. We have been producing about a 185,000 and it is now under review to take it all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day. Again very, very strong operational reliability and very good reservoir performance. So the point I am making is above the additional ramp up that's anticipated from the major project startups, there is also another layer of capacity that we are building on based on the organization's focus on the operational capabilities of our assets.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Just to be clear, Jeff, on the Permian piece of that, I think at the time of the acquisition you talked about moving to a 15-rig program. What's the starting point for that? What are you running right now?","Jeff Woodbury","So you are talking about the recent acquisition, I believe?","Doug Leggate","Right.","Jeff Woodbury","So let me back up and first I say that if you look at the overall development of the new acreage, we see that over the long term it would support a multi-decade production plateau of about 350,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. So a very substantial addition to liquids production as well and in fact if I can put it in scale for you, if you remember, in my prepared comments, I said that our current liquids production from XTO represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. If you were just to add on the expectation from the Delaware acreage, that would take us up somewhere between 20% to 25% of our global liquids production. So the point being is, it's a very material part of the portfolio. As I indicated, we have got 10 rigs running right now. We are planning on ramping up that activity over the near future. But what we would do is, commensurate with the leasehold development requirements, we are very, very positive about this obviously given the acquisition and we want to get to it right away.","Doug Leggate","Jeff, I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is a very quick one. Payara, I think in Guyana, the limited disclosure you have given us so far, I guess, has raised some questions about potential scale. Is there anything you can tell us about relative scale or absolute scale of both the Liza and Payara reserve expectations ultimately but also like the development plan on both and the outlook of production system? And I will live it there. Thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, Doug. So, as we indicated in the third quarter, given the Liza-3 appraisal well, that really built confidence in a view that we have got at least a billion barrels of recoverable reserve. Since then, we have drilled a deeper zone that added additional volume, as I indicated in the prepared comments. Payara, we are very pleased with the outcome. We moved very quickly two drill additional sidetracks in order to better define the reservoir. And as I said, I think the next critical piece of information will be this well test we are starting right now. And that will allow us to size Payara. Now obviously, as we move along in each operational activity, that data is feeding our real time development planning effort to assess the full development scope of the block. And remember, we have got two other blocks that we will have to integrate as well. But right now, we are moving forward with the initial phase development. As we have said previously, it's 100,000 barrel a day FPSO. We do feel like that's a prudent step, very good strong returns and right now, we view that as just the initial phase.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I will wait till the Analyst Day. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","We will go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Yes. Hi. Two quick ones for me, Jeff. Regarding your CapEx, is that just strictly E&D or you are including the acquisition costs for Bass?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, John, on the Permian acquisition, remember we are purchasing that via shares. So it excludes that share purchase.","John Herrlin","Okay. Well, it would still be part of the costs incurred at the end of the day, but that's fine. Next on Payara, is that age correlative with the upper Liza pay or the lower Liza pay or can you not say anything on that?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. I really don't have anything to share on that at this point.","John Herrlin","Okay. That's it. Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Doug.","Doug Terreson","Just for clarification, is it correct that the $2.1 billion in asset sale gains were after tax and included in the $1.7 billion earnings figure and either way, could you provide some guidance as to which operating segments that these gains came from?","Jeff Woodbury","So the proceeds of $2.1 billion are -- you are asking about the proceeds that we had in the press release?","Doug Terreson","Correct.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Those are before tax proceeds.","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","And then those proceeds are primarily within our downstream portfolio. I would say about over 80% of it, it's in the downstream.","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Jeff Woodbury","And the largest part of that is in the Canada retail sales.","Doug Terreson","Can you give guidance on after-tax?","Jeff Woodbury","On the proceeds?","Doug Terreson","Yes.","Jeff Woodbury","Now I don't have any numbers to share with you on that.","Doug Terreson","Okay. And then also, three of your competitors have taken steps to enhance their pay for performance linkage by changing the metrics that they are using for their business units to ones which tie to intrinsic value in the stock market and probably CEO pay too. And while your stock has outperformed some of these companies in the equity market over the years, my question is, how is the company thinking about P-for-P this year and specifically where there is a need for change given its rising profile as a corporate governance issue with investors?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, if you remember -- you are talking about our executive compensation program?","Doug Terreson","I am.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. As you and I have talked in the past, remember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule and it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we are making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about 5 years. The remaining 50% after 10 years, really it's the later of 10 years or retirement. So some of us go even beyond 10 years, but it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does payout, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I will tell you that the compensation committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. For those that are listening about it, we have got, what we call an executive compensation overview disclosure that we send out annually that provide a lot of good detail about the structure of the program.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Doug, just a follow-up on your question regarding the Canadian retail. As I said in my prepared comments, it was $522 million after tax.","Doug Terreson","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company.","Sam Margolin","Good morning Jeff. How are you?","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Sam.","Sam Margolin","So late in the quarter, you finally got FERC approval for Golden Pass. I guess I would add that to the bucket in one of the later slides about de-lengthening your U.S. nat-gas position, maybe. So I was wondering, I am sure you have made comments on this before, but how do you think now in the new environment or how things have played out currently, how U.S. LNG competes with some of your other world-scale LNG potential assets around the world? And how do you think about that moving forward as you want to develop additional U.S. gas assets in the context of that?","Jeff Woodbury","It's a good question, Sam. The best place to start is really thinking about it from our overall energy outlook and our supply and demand balances. Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost it's up to like 250% of today's LNG net capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you are going to have periods in which there is oversupply and periods where there is insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects where there is period in which they will see LNG over supply. Now if I step back from that that's, if you will, the value proposition and I step back, we have got a very extensive portfolio and I would tell you that brownfield developments that is incremental investments to existing operations like Papa New Guinea or even Golden Pass provide us economic advantage by lowering the cost by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC approval. The one key step that we are still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA export authorization. And we are hopeful that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you have heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we are pursuing long-term sales contracts. But they all will be evaluated on their own merits.","Sam Margolin","Okay. I guess my follow-up then, is on the same topic. It might be a similar answer on sort of an individual project analysis basis, but as you look within your 30-year outlook and a lot of energy demand globally is driven by gas and against the backdrop of early this year, the de-booking of some natural gas reserves domestically and an imperative to get those rebooked over time, what do you think is more preferable between uses of that gas for you? Investing in shipping it to these Asian demand centers via LNG? Or keeping it onshore and consuming it within your chemical business?","Jeff Woodbury","That's a good question. It really highlights and talks to the issue of optionality. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. Where do we see that gas going in the future, again stepping back from that energy outlook, we expect gas is going to grow about 1.5% per year. That's primarily driven by two things, one, power generation and the second thing petrochemicals. As you know, we have got a very integrated value chain. The anticipation is that resource will not only meet domestic growth and power generation, but we will also look at the utilization of that into our value chain in the chemicals business as well as, well, we started this discussion around LNG export, so optionality gives us tremendous amount of flexibility to make sure that we are maximizing the value proposition.","Sam Margolin","All right. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","You bet.","Operator","We will go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Hi. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning.","Evan Calio","I have a question. Any outlook on future project returns, conventional versus your acquired Permian? And I ask the question in the context that you make a significant acquisition in one of the tighter energy asset markets in the world, the Permian. You discuss a relatively healthy future plateau level of production, while there's distress in asset markets globally in regions in which Exxon operates. So I mean just given the assets and these longer laterals you discussed, can you talk about how you think the future returns compete within your portfolio or how advantaged they may be?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, from a general perspective, Evan, I would tell you that clearly the recent acquisition, predominantly in the Delaware Basin, is a very competitive. It really goes back to the fundamental objective that we are trying to achieve through acquisitions or through exploration or our investment program that is to make sure that we continue to maintain a focus on value accretive performance. So we are looking for investments that are going to continue to maintain our industry-leading return on capital employed. So certainly very attractive. We have given you sense for the economics where I think back in the second quarter we showed you some of the progress we have made in unit development cost, operating cost. We gave you a sense for the portfolio then, which with the Bakken improvement together, we had over 2,000 wells that achieved greater than 10% return, money forward economics, full and fully loaded on a $40 per barrel price. You add this acquisition into this, it takes us up to about 4,500 wells. So a very robust inventory. The long-term objective, thinking about the short cycle versus long cycle is one of making sure that the pace maximizes the learnings that we are integrating and captures a technology application that we want to apply in order to achieve these outcomes like the length of the laterals. But I would say that this acquisition and the investments that we plan under it are going to be very competitive to our existing inventory of opportunities.","Evan Calio","Can you even mention how much of your expected CapEx, $22 million CapEx, is in shorter cycle, however you define that, whether offshore or onshore? And related, how do you consider the value of capital flexibility or cycle times in your gating process, either as a plus or a minus for a longer cycle project?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. On the first question, I would tell you that we are going there to provide some more color in about a month's time at the Analyst Meeting. So if I ask you to just to hold that thought, we will give you a little bit more perspective at that time.","On the second one, the overall balance of short cycle versus long cycle, obviously we have got a very large resource inventory with over 90 billion barrels. We are trying to move that resource inventory at the same time maintaining a robust level of short cycle investments. Now, of course, that short cycle inventory continues to grow with all these acquisitions that we have been picking up. So that's done through our annual planning process. We look at the execution capability of the organization, the service sector and then we look at the fundamental cash management objective is to make sure that we have got that flexibility and a key element of when we share a CapEx objective, we have built in flexibility to the upside as well as flexibility to the downside. We know how to flex that program depending on what commodity prices do.","Evan Calio","I appreciate it.","Operator","We will go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel","Thanks. Hi Jeff. Jeff, I note that in the third quarter press release, you talked about the potential for needing to take some negative revisions to proved reserves in the oil sands and clearly, at least in the quarter, you haven't taken any financial impairments to those assets. Can you talk about whether you would still view those proved reserves as potentially needing to be written down? Or whether the price recovery into the end of the year was sufficient to allow those to remain on the books?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. It's a good question. Again, I want to make sure that everybody's very clear that there is a separation between proved reserves reporting under the SEC rules and then the whole issue of asset impairments. And really what you are asking, Jason, is I think clearly the question about proved reserves.","In the third quarter we indicated, because we thought it was prudent at the time given where crude prices were that we indicated that we were likely going to take as much 4.6 billion barrels out of proved and put them in our resource base. And I will remind you that I emphasized at that time that even though we make that transfer, there is no change to our operations or how we manage the business, those assets going forward. We will be announcing our final year-end reserves here in the next couple of weeks as we typically do. In short, we do expect to reflect most of the SEC pricing impact that we discussed in the third quarter, but I will also note that we anticipate that there will be some partial offsets to those numbers. So stay tuned, we will be finalizing that shortly and we will be releasing that information here in the next two weeks.","Jason Gammel","I appreciate that, Jeff. And then just as a follow-up, the InterOil acquisition that you announced this year, I am afraid I am a little bit lost on the process for actually completing the InterOil transaction. Can you talk about what is still outstanding there in order to get that deal done?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So we are going back through the process following a decision by Canadian courts and we have put in place a new amended agreement between InterOil and ExxonMobil. And I will just remind everybody that in the first process through, the InterOil Board fully unanimously approved this transaction and shareholders approved it by over 80%. So we are going back through the process and right now there is a shareholder vote anticipated in the middle of February. And then as in the last cycle through this, we will need to go back to the Yukon courts to make a final ruling on the offer and then hopefully close thereafter.","Jason Gammel","Great. Thanks Jeff. I appreciate that.","Operator","We will go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could have a couple of quick follow-ups on capital budget. And I realize you are giving more details next month. But how should we think about capital allocation for the Lower 48 business with the addition of the Permian acquisition? Does that highlight a growing relative share of the capital budget by the U.S. on shore? Is it additive to your existing activity? Or should we expect to see the capital diverted away from areas like the Bakken in Oklahoma and be replaced by activity in the Permian?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, Ryan, we will certainly provide more color here in a month or so. But I mean, directionally, it's a fairly sizable acquisition that we are making in the Permian. We feel good about our acreage position in the other unconventional basins. I showed you a map where we have got a meaningful presence in everyone of them. As an indicative guidance, I would tell you that it's likely going to add additional CapEx to our short cycle investments in order to move forward on the acreage that we have picked up in acquisition.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2016 CapEx, which came in quite a bit lower than guidance early in the year. Any comments on what were the primary drivers? Is that cost deflation, deferral of activity, change in any expected scope in spend?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Thanks for asking the question, Ryan, because I think it does reflect very well on how the corporation responded and particularly our people and their focus on recognizing that we are in a down cycle and we have got a great opportunity to take advantage during that down cycle. I would say that it really is a function of a number of things. One is and it all is underpinned by our very strong focus around capital discipline. But it comes down to capital efficiency opportunities that we are able to continue to capture, regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. It includes market capture. We all know that the service sector and the related costs have dropped materially. Also importantly it has to do with the very strong project execution performance on our operated projects, most of which coming in on-budget and on-cost. And then there was an element of how we paced our projects for several reasons. One, recognizing the business climate, wanting to stay within our means. And two, in a low price environment, there is unique value that we are able to capture by going back and recycling through the development planning process on some of these projects to try to do things like reduce the cost structure, add additional resource to increase resource density, but it really is a opportunity in the down cycle to go ahead and add incremental value to those future investment.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Paul.","Paul Sankey","Jeff, with the changes in Washington, I just wondered what Exxon has done to, firstly, I assume you guys are pro lifting sanctions on Russia. Secondly, I assume that you would be anti the border adjusted tax. And then finally, can you make any comments about the impact on your operations in Iraq from the recent limitations on travel there? I wondered if that was going to -- I assume that's going to directly impact you. Thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. I guess a couple of comments. We will continue to advocate for many of the areas you talked about, advocate for free market principles. When it comes down to the important discussion that's happening in Congress in the current administration around the tax code, we believe the tax code should be globally competitive. It should be predictable, stable, providing investment certainty and not picking winners and losers. So I mean, we will continue to stay principle based in our view on those matters.","With respect to Russia, we will continue to fully comply with the existing sanctions and I am not going to speculate when or if they are fully satisfied and removed in the future. And then on Iraq and more broadly speaking some of the issues associated with decisions taken in the U.S., a key aspect wherever we are around the world, including Iraq, is the security of our people and our contractors and we have very dedicated effort within the organization to ensure that we are trying to stay in front of potential threats that the organization needs to respond to in order to ensure the safety and security of our assets and people. So I would rather not talk about specifics, but I will tell you that we are monitoring the situation very closely.","Paul Sankey","Understood. Jeff, if I could completely change subject, the President of Guyana was commenting earlier in the week that we could see production startup in 2019 from Liza. Is that reasonable, do you think? We have also obviously heard from Hess about a final investment decision this year. And if we look back to what you did in Angola as an example of your speed with which you can get these things up and running with the idea of getting very early cash flow, I wondered if you could handicap the chances that we do see first production much sooner than the, I think you have been talking more 2021?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. It's a good question. Listen, I think first and foremost is that we are going to work with our co-ventures and the government to move this project along in the most efficient and expedient way. And all stakeholders have a role in deciding how this project moves forward. And we certainly understand the resource owners' interest and I will tell you, we are very attuned to it. As I indicated in my prepared comments, we think it is reasonable that the initial phase will move forward to an FID decision later this year. The guidance that we have been providing as well as consistent with the regulatory filings says that the initial phase would startup in 2020.","Paul Sankey","Got it, Jeff. Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","You are welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Asit Sen with CLSA Americas.","Asit Sen","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Good morning Asit.","Asit Sen","So thanks for the color on the short cycle versus long cycle. I just wanted to make sure I got the Permian numbers right. So the 140,000 barrels a day production now and your comment on the 350,000 barrels a day of plateau production from the recent Delaware acquisition, what time frame are we looking at?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, we have yet to share the specifics around the buildup of that. But as I indicated, Asit, we want to get at it quickly. But the 350,000 potential and that's oil equivalent barrels per day, we believe is a reasonable investment program that could be maintained over multi-decades.","Asit Sen","Got you. Okay. And my quick question on the new project startup, Barzan, is that a 2017 startup? And could you remind us on the working interest that you have there? 7% is that's what I have.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Our working interest is 7% and you really need to talk to the operator RasGas on specifics around the project.","Asit Sen","Great. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Moses Sutton","Hi. This is Moses Sutton, on for Paul. A quick question on the impairment charges. Have you completed the review of the entire portfolio? Or are certain assets still under review in 2017?","Jeff Woodbury","We have completed the review of the entire portfolio.","Moses Sutton","Great. Thank you. That's it from us.","Jeff Woodbury","You are welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.","Alastair Syme","Hi Jeff. I also had a question on the impairment. If you look back at your most recent energy outlook, it looks like you have made some quite big changes around the expectation on North American tight oil and gas. Is it possible to relate those changes back to today's impairment decision? It feels like you expect there's going to be a lot of growth in associated gas, for instance.","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I mean it's good question, Alastair, but I would tell you, the first point I would make is the reason why we do an annual updated energy outlook is really to make sure that we are most informed about the fundamental building blocks that really underpin that demand projection. The changes that you are asking about is really a function of a number of factors. It's not just energy outlook. We do this in conjunction with our annual budget and plans process. And it also is of the function as part of the energy outlook is looking at the competitiveness of different resources that underpin that demand outlook. So it's a number of factors that will drive our decisions and ultimately the choices that we make.","Alastair Syme","Thank you. As a follow-up, can I ask, can you explain what non-U.S. tax effects are on the corporate items? Are these upstream or downstream items?","Jeff Woodbury","The non-U.S. tax items are really across a number of the business segments, but the largest in the fourth quarter were primarily in the upstream business.","Alastair Syme","Is it possible to get any color what they relate to?","Jeff Woodbury","No, we don't have any additional information to share.","Alastair Syme","Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","You are welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Brendan Warren with BMO Capital Markets.","Brendan Warren","Thanks Jeff. Just first question, just on those five major project startups. You flagged 2017 into 2018, particularly with Hebron and Sakhalin that you do operate. Are they still in 2017, recognizing Hebron most recently said it was on track for end-2017. I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. That's correct. They are currently on plan to achieve those objectives.","Brendan Warren","Okay. So they are both in before end-2017. And then my follow-up refers and you would probably say defer this to the capital markets day, but if I refer back to slide 33 from the capital markets day, you had given guidance of cash flow from operations and asset sales for 2016 with a range at $40 a barrel to $80 a barrel. It looks like at $45 average for this year, you have just come in where the $40 a barrel line should be. I am trying to reconcile, you had a weaker cash flow number for 2016. And whether that changes your view for 2017 in terms of cash flow from operations?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Brendan, a good question. An important dialog that we think is something that we should be talking to and we will update that chart you are referring to in the upcoming Analyst Day here within a month and be ready to talk more about it with our current views.","Brendan Warren","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Woodbury","Welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","Yes. Good morning at top of the hour here. Two questions, I guess. Firstly, decline rates. I mean you guys have done very well on the production side to minimize base decline. You have got long duration assets in a number of geographies. Maybe just a quick update as far out as you could go on expected decline rate on the base business.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So we assess our long-term decline rate over every year and in fact, it's in our 10-K. And what we have had in terms of a decline rate here in the recent past, last couple of years, has been 3%. And let me just qualify that 3% as being that does not include project activity. So if we were to stop our investment program, that's what we would have.","Ed Westlake","Yes.","Jeff Woodbury","Okay.","Ed Westlake","And then we haven't really had a conversation around OpEx and margins, maybe deferred tax maybe to the prior question on cash flow as you go forward, but maybe just a word on how much more savings you can get on OpEx? The new projects, are they accretive to margins? And then what you expect to happen to deferred taxes as prices bump up a little here?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. A really good question in terms of OpEx and how we are managing that. I would tell you that we are never satisfied. We clearly understand there's been a lot of progress here over the last two years, but I can tell you that the organization doesn't believe status quo is sufficient. As I alluded to previously, we will continue to look for structural opportunities. We will continue to be very focused on our organizational effectiveness. And importantly, we will continue to work with the service sector to come up with lower cost, higher quality opportunities. And I am sure if the activity continues to build, there is going to be market pressures, but we are going to continue to work against those market pressures to capture incremental value.","On deferred income taxes in the future, there's really nothing more I can share with you. You can appreciate some of this has to do with the current low price environment that have been through here last couple years.","Ed Westlake","And margin should also improve with the new projects coming on, presumably?","Jeff Woodbury","Well, that's the objective of the investment program. Thanks, Ed.","Operator","We will go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.","Theepan Jothilingam","Yes. Hi. Good morning Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two actually. Firstly, could you talk about, I know you are intending to issue equity for the recent Permian transaction. Is there any thoughts about buying back to offset that dilution? And my second question, just in terms of exploration for 2017. I know the focus is on Guyana, but could you talk about any other high impact place for 2017 and the spend associated? Thank you.","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. So Theepan, on the fundamental question of, to me, I interpret it as whether we would buy back any stock and I will go back to our earlier discussion around it. It's really a quarterly decision that management makes based on a number of variables that I have already described. And as I said in the prepared comments, we don't anticipate doing any type of buybacks, other than into to address anti-dilutive impacts associated with the benefits programs and plans.","On other exploration focus, we expect for the near term, flat spend out to out through the next several years, but I have shared a number of key areas that we are focusing our attention. Cypress, the high quality block we have got there on Block 10 that we have entered in negotiations on the production sharing contract, but we are very encouraged by it. Mexico, the Block 1 that we picked up, which is right along the U.S. border adjacent to some U.S. acreage that we have got. Again, very encouraged by it, putting plans in place. I indicated that we continue to expand to our exploration acreage position in Papa New Guinea. You think about some of the big high potential areas for us, Papa New Guinea is very important to us. Guyana, that area has been very important to us. And then as we have been talking about often on today is the unconventional business with a very strong focus on the liquids potential. So I think it really does make a very strong statement around the value proposition that we are trying to deliver to our shareholders.","Theepan Jothilingam","Okay. Thanks Jeff. I was just wondering, when you think about potential acquisition add between equity and adding debt, could you talk about how the market should think about that? Should we see if there are opportunities Exxon uses paper rather than debt?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes. Well, it's going to be case specific. I mean the important message for you to understand is that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of a given transaction is really a function of the dialog between the parties with the focus of what the seller wants from the transaction. But I wouldn't read anymore into it relating to our capital structure.","Theepan Jothilingam","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question guys. Just two quick ones. You mentioned that almost all of the increase towards the $22 billion CapEx budget reflects higher activity. Can you be a little more specific on what service cost inflation you are assuming, particularly in your North American CapEx?","Jeff Woodbury","Pavel, as I indicated earlier, we are going to provide more color around our investment plans in about a month's time in the Analyst Meeting. I would just ask you to hold out until we get to that point.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And as far as the InterOil closing process, you are currently doing the rerun of the shareholder vote. Should the Yukon court bock the second attempt, as they blocked the first one, is there any other alternative in your mind to getting shareholder approval?","Jeff Woodbury","Yes, well, I mean let me not speculate as to how this will progress. Very strong support from the shareholders of InterOil. This is a process that InterOil is running and we think that we have addressed some of the comments that were made in the first process. So let's let that go through and then we will decide how we move forward from there.","Pavel Molchanov","All right. I appreciate it.","Jeff Woodbury","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Jeff Woodbury","Well, I want to thank everybody for their participation today and I really do appreciate your time and the questions. We appreciate your continues interest in ExxonMobil and we really do look forward to visiting with you next month at the Analyst Meeting. So until then, we will keep very focused on our fundamental mission of growing long-term shareholder value. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"8748":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  1, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Neil Hansen \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations and Secretary","Conference Call Participants","Doug Terreson \u2013 Evercore ISI","Sam Margolin \u2013 Whiteolfe Research","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Phil Gresh \u2013 J.P.

Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Hansen","All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I\u2019m Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. During today's call, I'll review our financial and operating performance and provide updates on the substantial progress we've made on our major growth projects. I'll be happy to take your questions following my prepared remarks.","My comments this morning will reference the slides available on the investor section of our website. I'd also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation.","Moving to Slide 3 let me begin by summarizing the excellent progress we've made this year on plans to grow shareholder value. The long-term fundamentals that underpin our investments remain strong. We've generated nearly $9 billion in earnings through the first nine months of the year with a portfolio that is resilient to a range of commodity prices and margins.","We are investing in advantage projects that will grow the earnings and cash generation capacity of each of our businesses. Nearly $23 billion of CapEx year-to-date is in line with current year plans and reflect strong execution of key deliverables. Liquids production has increased significantly from last year with volumes up 131,000 barrels per day or 6%, driven by strong growth in the Permian. We remain on track to meet the full year outlook of producing 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day this year.","In addition, efforts to high-grade our portfolio are proceeding ahead of schedule, putting the consideration from the agreement we signed to sell non-operating upstream assets in Norway. The divestments now totaled nearly $5 billion. Exploration success has continued this year with five significant deep water discoveries, four in Guyana and one in Cyprus. And we've reached final investment decisions for 10 major strategic projects this year, including projects from all three business lines.","We also increased the quarterly dividend by 6% marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Finally, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the capacity to invest through the cycle with leverage at just 12%. The positive momentum we've generated so far this year is in line with the plans that we laid out in 2018 and reiterated in March and positions us well to generate long-term shareholder value.","I will now highlight third quarter financial performance starting on Slide 4. Earnings were $3.2 billion in the quarter or $0.75 per share, putting a positive $0.07 per share impact from a one-time tax item. The results were consistent with expectations given the margin environment, seasonal impacts and planned maintenance experienced during the quarter. Crude oil prices declined relative to the second quarter while refining margins improved. Broader margin environment remained challenging as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and industry chemical and lube based oil margins.","Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion in the quarter, after adjusting for changes in working capital, cash flow was $8 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion. PP&E adds and net investments and advances, which is a proxy for cash CapEx was $6.6 billion and that ratio is consistent with our rule of thumb, that cash CapEx is generally 85% of total reported CapEx. Free cash flow in the quarter increased to $2.9 billion reflecting higher cash generation and moderately lower investments in the quarter. I'll now go through a more detailed view of developments since the second quarter on the next slide.","In the Upstream, both liquids and gas realizations were lower in the third quarter, consistent with a decrease in liquids markers and continued gas supply length. Production was in line with our expectations with continued growth in the Permian. The Liza destiny FPSO is currently being commissioned in Guyana and we announced the fourth discovery of this year with the Tripletail exploration well. We also made considerable progress on our $15 billion divestment program reaching an agreement to sell our Norway non-operated assets.","In the Downstream refining fuels margins improved during the quarter with supply tightness and stronger distillate demand in Asia and Europe. On the other hand, North American logistics differentials narrowed, primarily driven by the addition of Permian pipeline capacity. Lower scheduled maintenance, most notably the completion of turnaround activities at our Joliet refinery and improved reliability relative to the second quarter contributed to stronger downstream financial performance.","Although long-term fundamentals remains strong in the chemical business, polyethylene and aromatics margins continue to be impacted by supply length from industry capacity additions. The recent startup of the polyethylene expansion at Beaumont is performing well and running above planned rates. Supporting efforts to grow sales of high-performance, metallocene products had delivered sustainability benefits including lighter-packaging weight, lower energy consumption, and reduced emissions. Lower scheduled maintenance across U.S. Gulf Coast sites continue \u2013 contributed to improved chemical earnings, although this was partly offset by a reliability event at Baytown.","We also progressed research and development of lower emissions technologies. We entered into an agreement with Mosaic Materials to explore a breakthrough carbon capture technology using metalorganic frameworks to separate carbon dioxide from the air. The agreement expands our carbon capture technology research portfolio and will enable evaluation of opportunities for industrial uses at scale. We also signed an agreement with the Indian \u2013 the Indian Institute of Technology. This partnership will focus on progressing research in biofuels and bioproducts, gas transport and conversion, and other low-emissions technologies for the power and industrial sectors. This expands our portfolio of research collaborations, which now stands at more than 80 universities, five energy centers, and multiple private sector partnerships.","Let's move now to Slide 6 for an overview of third quarter earnings relative to the second quarter of this year. Third quarter earnings of $3.2 billion were up $40 million from the second quarter. Upstream earnings declined by approximately $1.1 billion driven by lower liquids realizations and the absence of a favorable tax item. Downstream earnings increased by nearly $800 million with lower scheduled maintenance and stronger industry margins. Improvements in downstream earnings were partly offset by the decline in North American differentials. Chemical earnings increased by $50 million with lower scheduled maintenance, partly offset by the reliability event at Baytown.","Finally, Corp and Fin earnings increased by $300 million due to the previously mentioned favorable tax item. I'll review changes in Upstream volumes on Slide 7, production in the third quarter was 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 113,000 oil equivalent barrels per day relative to the third quarter of last year, representing a 3% increase. The higher volumes were driven by growth of 123,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian, representing a 72% increase from the prior year quarter.","The third quarter cash profile is shown on Slide 8, third quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $9.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities. There was a $1.6 billion release of working capital in the quarter, driven primarily by inventory effects related to maintenance activities. Other items included the favorable one-time non-cash tax item. Our divestment program is progressing well and ahead of schedule. Third quarter proceeds from asset sales includes a deposit for the $4.5 billion Norway asset sale and the cash received for the sale of our Mobile Bay asset. Third quarter additions to PP&E and net investments in advances were $6.6 billion. Gross debt increased by approximately $2 billion and cash ended the quarter at $5.4 billion.","I\u2019ll now provide an update on the excellent progress we are making on key investments across all of our businesses, a summary is provided on Slide 9. Starting with the upstream, growth plans in the Permian and Guyana remain on track and I'll provide some additional details on these projects in the coming slides. In Brazil, we expect the Petrobras operated Uirapuru well to commence drilling in the fourth quarter.","In the downstream, three new projects are online and performing well, supporting increased production of cleaner, higher-value products. We've made final investment decisions this year for four additional projects including the Beaumont light crude expansion and the Wink to Webster pipeline, both of which will support our integrated Permian strategy and growth plans. In our chemical business, with the recent start-up of the Beaumont polyethylene expansion, we now have eight new facilities online with four additional projects receiving final investment decisions this year.","Moving to Slide 10. I'll provide an update on our unconventional business. Permian growth remains on track with production averaging 293,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. Although, we are in the early stages in the development of this significant resource, results are encouraging, including continued strong well performance. Construction of processing and takeaway capacity also continues. An important milestone this quarter was the completion of the Phase 1 of the Delaware central delivery point and the pipeline to the Wink terminal.","I'll provide an update on Guyana on Slide 11. Commissioning of the Liza Phase 1 FPSO is underway and on schedule. The target for achieving first oil is December, dependent on favorable weather conditions. This was placed start-up within five years of initial discovery, well ahead of the typical pace for the industry of closer to nine years. Liza Phase 2 engineering and construction is progressing well, following FID earlier this year. And we're also working with the government to receive necessary project approvals for Payara with the plan start-up in 2023.","The Tripletail discovery which we announced in September, marked the fourth exploration success of 2019, the well encountered 108 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone and we are also pleased to highlight that with deeper drilling on the well, additional hydrocarbon reservoirs were encountered, providing potential upside to this \u2013 to the initial discovery. We continued to progress considerable undrilled potential in Guyana with a fourth drilling ship, which will commence exploration activity in the fourth quarter. Three upcoming wells, Uaru, Mako, and Hassa are planned to spud in the upcoming months. Locations of those Wells are highlighted here on the map.","I\u2019ll now provide some perspectives on the upcoming IMO 2020 implementation on Slide 13. The chart on the left highlights the coking capacity advantage we have relative to our integrated peer group. A position we recently strengthened with a start-up of the Antwerp coker. This new facility upgrades bunker fuel oil, currently produced in our Northern European refineries to higher value products, including ultra-low sulfur diesel.","The middle chart shows the clean\/dirty spread using Asia gas oil and high sulfur fuel oil. As you can see, the spread is expanding with the forward curve and third-party estimate ranges showing further widening, which will favor more complex refiners with the capacity to upgrade heavier sour crudes to cleaner products. And just to give you some additional perspective, a general rule of thumb for our portfolio is that for every dollar per barrel change in the clean\/dirty spread, downstream annual earnings will increase by approximately $150 million. Now a large portion of the benefit comes from the associated widening of the light-sweet and heavy-sour crude spreads, and our ability to leverage coking capacity to run higher quantities of discounted crudes.","Now turning to Slide 14, I'll provide additional details on our portfolio management activities. We've made considerable progress on our 2021 divestment objective of $15 billion, reaching an agreement to sell our non-operated Norway assets for $4.5 billion. The sale includes ownership and more than 20 fields and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.","The sales price of $4.5 billion is subject to interim period adjustments with an effective date of January 1, 2019. Estimated total cash flow from the divestment is approximately $3.5 billion after closing adjustments, with expected 2019 cash proceeds of $2.6 billion. And we will receive another $0.9 billion of non-contingent consideration and tax refunds over the next few years. We are also progressing marketing activities involving, but not limited to, assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan and Malaysia.","I'll now provide some perspective on our outlook for the fourth quarter starting on Slide 15. In the Upstream, we expect production to increase in the fourth quarter, largely driven by seasonal gas demand, and I'll provide some additional detail on the seasonality of gas demand on a following chart. With regards to the Norway divestment, again, assuming regulatory approvals are received, we anticipate the sale will close in December and that we will recognize an earnings gain of approximately $3.5 billion.","[Technical Difficulty] potential for further expansion of clean\/dirty and sweet\/sour spreads as preparations for the IMO spec change continue. Higher scheduled maintenance in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is also expected to impact results","Chemical margins will likely remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as the market continues to work through supply length from recent industry capacity additions. Scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the fourth quarter should be generally in line with third quarter levels, and we expect continued recovery from the third quarter reliability event at Baytown. I'll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance on a subsequent slide.","The chart on Slide 16, shows the increase in volumes on oil equivalent basis that we typically experience from higher gas demand in Europe in the fourth quarter. And as you know, gas demand is highly seasonal and driven by weather conditions. Fourth quarter gas demand has been on average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day higher than the third quarter, and we expect a similar trend to occur this year.","Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide some perspectives on our fourth quarter outlook for Downstream and Chemical scheduled maintenance. As previously mentioned, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream this year is higher than normal, again, in part due to preparation for IMO 2020. Planned maintenance tends to be seasonal, in line with demand patterns. We expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the fourth quarter to be higher relative to what we experienced in the fourth quarter \u2013 in the third quarter. The estimated earnings impacts for the fourth quarter and first quarter 2020 for the Downstream are shown on the upper left chart.","In the Chemical business, shown on the bottom left chart, we expect scheduled maintenance levels to be generally in line with the third quarter and significantly below the peak we saw in the second quarter of this year.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few key messages on Slide 18. In the Upstream, we are delivering on plans to grow liquids production and high-grade the portfolio. Recent project start-ups in Downstream and Chemical, continue to perform well, and we reached final investment decisions for eight key projects so far this year.","We are also leveraging our significant financial capacity to progress advantaged investments through the cycle, maintaining constancy of purpose on our commitment to grow long-term shareholder value across a range of market environments. Finally, but importantly, we are building on our extensive network of partnerships to develop new technologies to address the dual challenge of providing reliable and affordable energy, while mitigating impacts to the environment, including the risk of climate change.","And I'll be more than happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Neil Hansen","Hi, good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson","Neil, in U.S. Upstream, you mentioned that the key factors this period were realizations, divestitures, output gains, but also higher growth expenses. And on this point, I want to see if we could get more color on the last item, since we can gauge the others to some degree and specifically are these higher growth expenses primarily the Permian? If so, do you consider them to be transitional in nature and when will they become less significant? And then thirdly, are they tracking with your expectations? So three questions on the higher growth expenses item in U.S. Upstream.","Neil Hansen","Yes. I appreciate the question, Doug. So just focusing on U.S. Upstream, so if you look at the change in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, earnings declined by roughly $300 million. Most of that was price, so it was about $190 million impact on price in the Upstream. We did have a few other factors, including some downtime and maintenance in non or unconventional assets, including La Barge and Prudhoe Bay, that had an impact as well, and then we did have some higher growth expenses. Most of that does it relate to the progress that we're making in the Permian.","And maybe I can just touch on that really quick. I mean I think obviously, we feel really good about the volume growth that we see out there. The resource continues to respond very well. We're making good progress on the development plan that we have in place, including making sure that we capture the full value of the resource.","If you're using our logistics position to bring barrels to our refineries and chemical plants, the pace of development is consistent with the plans that we laid out. I think we finished the third quarter with 55 rigs and roughly 10 frac crews, and as I mentioned, volume growth relative to last year in the same quarter was 72%. But we're early in the development. We've only drilled, I think a few hundred wells and that's on a well inventory in excess of 8,000.","So it's pretty early days, but we feel like we're making really good progress, we're leveraging the full strength of the corporation and bringing our unique competitive advantages, the scale, the technology. We're leveraging sophistication in the sub-surface using reservoir modeling, we're bringing drilling engineers from all of the world that have expertise in dealing with some of these environments, and of course, our project management capability.","So I think in terms of pace, I think, the OpEx is where we would expect it to be. Now when we think about the development, we're trying to balance certainly well productivity. We want to do well there, but we're balancing that with ensuring we excel in terms of ultimate recovery and then, of course, capital efficiency. So that \u2013 those are the three elements we're trying to balance.","I think we feel good about where we are. I think we've said that this is a very resilient asset. Even at $35 a barrel, we expect to generate a 10% return. So I would expect, even though we feel like we're where we should be at this point, you can fully anticipate as we bring technology to this, as we bring expertise and drilling in the sub-surface, our project management capabilities, we will only become more efficient over time and drive down those costs. I mean we're never satisfied with where we are, and we always can feel like we can get even better. So really good progress, but also very high expectations in the organization that will only get better in developing the resource.","Doug Terreson","Okay, and so it seems like if the production curve steepens in 2020 and beyond, then we'll see pretty strong results from that asset. So, okay well, thanks a lot, Neil.","Neil Hansen","Yes. Thanks, Doug. I appreciate the question.","Doug Terreson","You're welcome.","Operator","Next we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.","Sam Margolin","Hey, good morning.","Neil Hansen","Hey, Sam. How are you?","Sam Margolin","I'm good, thanks. So thanks for the color on the Norway sale. I mean, based on the gain there, it looks like this asset was pretty much fully depreciated and it sort of stimulates a question about maintenance spending around some of these longer-tail assets, whether or not the whole industry has kind of deferred that activity and these assets that are mature, sort of, changing hands into more local entities that are incentivized differently to spend. So is that sort of the right read on the overall landscape for divestitures, and if so, what does that mean for your baseline spending irrespective of the growth columns that you have, and maybe even a macro tangent, if you have time to?","Neil Hansen","Yes. I appreciate the question, Sam. Again we feel really good about the progress we're making on that divestment program and the fact Norway was accelerated. So that's why we feel we're ahead of schedule. We didn't anticipate being able to execute that divestment this year. So I think the organization has done a nice job of progressing that objective. But I think you all should recognize the reason we're pursuing the divestment program primarily is given the fact that we have brought so many attractive assets into the portfolio, you think about Permian and the Guyana, the LNG projects, that has placed pressure on the organization to high grade even more so, than we have in the past.","When we look at asset sales and what assets we might consider high-grading, Sam, it's generally going to be driven by strategic fit, it's going to be driven by the materiality of the asset, its growth potential. We also take into account things like whether or not we operate and have control afford investment plans, I don't want to convey, certainly from our perspective or from an industry perspective that their forgoing needed maintenance to ensure that these facilities are running well and that we're maximizing production from them.","So I think it's probably more so for us, Sam. It's more a factor of this pressure that we feel because the portfolio has really increased in terms of attractiveness and value. We feel like there is an opportunity for us to high grade the portfolio, and even \u2013 having this opportunity to even grow more, the overall value by high-grading out our assets.","Sam Margolin","Okay, thanks so much. And then my follow-up, sort of, on the other side, on the acquisition front. Bearing in mind the comment about resilient returns in the Permian, double digit down to $35 oil, I think that has more to do with your development plan than necessarily prevailing trends in the industry, because certainly it doesn't look like the independents can make similar claims. So what does that mean in terms of where we're at in the cycle for you too if you think about bolting on some assets here? It seems like you can add value to some distressed situations. Thank you.","Neil Hansen","Yes. I appreciate it, Sam. So I think if I step back with what we're trying to do, we're managing a portfolio, and as good as we feel about the opportunities that have come in \u2013 and you mentioned Permian, Guyana and some of the other assets we've been able to bring in, as good we feel about that, the objective remains trying to grow the overall value of that portfolio. We're trying to increase the pie. And so we never sit still.","We're always looking at additional opportunities that we think we can bring in into the portfolio. And so I think that certainly would include M&A, it includes looking at any other additional opportunity that's out there. Now for it to come into the portfolio, obviously, it's going to have to compete with what already is in our portfolio. That's certainly one measure of consideration. And the other thing is for us, we have to see an opportunity where we can bring a unique value where we can leverage our competitive strengths to offer something that the industry can't provide or can deliver, and so it's something we're looking at very closely.","We are in a fortunate position given the portfolio that we have, that we can be very choosy. We're very fortunate, and that we have the financial strength, the balance sheet capacity to transact at any level and any cycle. And so that gives you a nice \u2013 a nice spot to be in and to be very, very selective in what you're pursuing, very selective in what you're trying to do, because whatever we bring in, is going to have to compete with what's already in the portfolio.","So Sam, I think the environment is generally pretty good. There are a lot of things to look at, there's a lot of things to consider. I think for us it's just a question whether or not we can transact at the right value, whether or not we can add unique value to the asset given our competitive advantages and our strengths.","But have no doubt, the objective is that we want to continue to find ways to grow the overall value of what we have, including bringing things in that also includes high-grading the portfolio as we talked about. And the other thing we may not talk enough about, it also includes making sure that you execute the investments in the projects that you have well, that you bring them on budget, on schedule and that you run your existing base well. That is what we see as the objectives in terms of being able to grow that overall value.","Sam Margolin","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, Neil. Thanks for taking the time.","Neil Hansen","Hey, Neil.","Neil Mehta","I guess, the first question I have is just around IMO 2020. We've seen \u2013 certainly seen a lot of other companies, including yourself point forward maintenance into 2019, so you can maximize the upside to IMO. So do you ultimately think that will cap the upside, that return of throughput as you go into 2020? And just any early thoughts from Exxon standpoint about how this playing out.","Neil Hansen","Yes, I appreciate the question. I'll maybe step back a little bit and talk about what we're seeing. We mentioned in our prepared remarks. But you are starting to see certainly early transition with IMO on the product side. We've seen high sulfur fuel oil cracks, or significantly the clean\/dirty spreads, I think recently we reached near 10-year highs. And so I think the market will be dynamic in the early stages of this transition, but certainly on the product side, you're already seeing some of that widening of that spread and the forward curves are indicating that as well.","On the crude differentials, this difference between heavy-sour and light-sweet, we will also follow those same trends, right. I mean, low conversion refineries are going to be incentivized to run those sweet crudes, which will obviously widen out that spread and the futures curve is showing that. But again, we anticipate you'll see some choppiness, some volatility. There are a lot of variables at play here. It's a global market, but I don't think that we have any expectation that you wouldn't see those two key factors, that \u2013 widening of that clean\/dirty spread, the widening of the heavy-sour and light-sweet.","I don't \u2013 I think over time, the response to that will be the refining industry will have to add coking capacity. That's certainly something that we've done, I don't know if there is any level of maintenance that could be done that would minimize the impact of this. I think the market impact is too big to be able to respond to it with just pure maintenance. I think ultimately, the industry will have to add coking capacity, and that's why we feel really good about where we are, Neil.","I mean, we've got more coking capacity than any of our peers, we've done the maintenance, we've added Antwerp. So we feel like we're very well positioned. Our conversion capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast is very high. I mentioned the coker in Europe, and we're also looking at upgrading resid in Singapore as well. So I think ultimately, that is what is going to have to be the response from industry.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Neil. And the follow-up is, one of your capabilities as a company is managing regulatory and political risk. As we go into the election season here in the United States, how do you think about risks around federal public lands and what that means for your exposure, and thinking about that in the context of New Mexico, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico?","Neil Hansen","Yes. Thanks, Neil. Appreciate the question. I think it's difficult to speculate on the impact of a policy without details on implementation. I think any effort obviously to ban fracking would have a negative impact on industry efforts to develop resources like the Permian. There is no doubt on that, but when you look at the motivation of those policies, I mean if the underlying concern is about risk of climate change and emissions reduction, we certainly share similar concerns. But we think they are more effective policies and we also think there are technology advances that are required.","For example, we've been a very long-term vocal advocate of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. It's uniform it's transparent, it will incentivize the market to find solutions. I think any efforts to ban fracking or restrict supply will not remove demand for the resource. If anything, it will shift the economic benefit away from the U.S. to another country and potentially impact the price of that commodity here and globally.","So we think there are better policies that policymakers can put in place, and we certainly spend a lot of time advocating for those policies. If it's a concern about responsible resource development, and \u2013 we share that same interest. We hold ourselves to a high standard, we work with regulators to improve industry standards, and we advocate for policies that will be effective in that space as well.","I think when you think about political risk, one of the ways we approach that is working with policy makers to help them understand the policy decisions and help them understand the potential consequences of those. We've been in the business for a long time and I think with our experience in the industry, we have a good line of sight on what policies we think would be would be effective.","The other thing we're trying to do Neil is, is help policymakers understand the tremendous benefits that resource development brings to economies, that brings to employment and to society. In fact, a recent study was done. I don't know if you saw this, but the development in the Permian, our development in the Permian Basin for New Mexico, will generate approximately $64 billion in economic benefits over the next 40 years.","So I think helping policymakers understand what policies are more effective to address some of these concerns is important. And then I think also helping them recognize the economic benefit from responsible development of the resource. The other thing though, I think it highlights, there is political risk almost everywhere where we operate. And having a global portfolio like we have, helps us mitigate risk in any potential or specific jurisdiction. So I think \u2013 I certainly can understand if all your eggs are in one basket and we have a lot of political risk there, that there would be concern, but we feel like we can mitigate it with our portfolio, and then having this approach by working with policymakers.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Neil.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, Neil.","Operator","And next we'll go to Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning, Neil.","Neil Hansen","Hey, good morning, Phil. How are you?","Phil Gresh","Good. So first question, you were talking earlier about execution on the existing portfolio, an opportunity set. One of your peers today , just highlighted a 25% increase in capital spending cost at Tengiz, and obviously you are on that project. But just wondering how you view general inflation risks in \u2013 across the portfolio from a capital spending perspective. or would you characterize Tengiz as more of a one-off? Thank you.","Neil Hansen","Yes. I appreciate the question, Phil. Look, I'd recommend any specific questions on project cost and schedule, it's more appropriate for those to be directed to Chevron as the operator. What I can say is, we certainly expect and I mentioned this on the call, we expect to meet our CapEx outlook for this year. This increase in Tengiz cost does put upward pressure on future capital programs \u2013 future-year capital programs. We're doing everything we can, working to accommodate that within our program and we will provide an update on where that stands at the Investor Day in March.","I think you are talking about inflationary pressures, I think it's dependent on where you are operating. I think we've generally seen a fairly good cost environment in the deepwater. For example, in the Permian in the unconventional business, I think for the most part, we've seen a very good operating environment. We have seen a fairly hot market on the Gulf Coast, given all the capacity additions in the Chemical business on the refining side. And I think we foresee those cost pressures and we try and leverage our scale and our functional excellence to do everything we can to mitigate those cost pressures.","Let me just give you a couple of examples. Maybe the most relevant one, on the U.S. Gulf Coast. If you look at the steam cracker that we're putting in place down near Corpus Christi, again, recognizing the cost pressures on the Gulf Coast, that influenced the location of that steam cracker. It also allowed us to leverage our capabilities globally. For example, one of the things we often do in the Upstream to avoid a high cost environment is you build modulars and lower cost locations, and then bring them to the site. We're doing the same thing with that steam cracker on the U.S. Gulf Coast.","The result of that is that project would be 25% lower than the industry standard steam cracker. And so, I think you're always going to find different environments depending on where you operate, and I think we try to use our global procurement organization, our project expertise to make sure that we mitigate those costs. But it is something you have to watch very closely, because you can't undermine the value of any given investment if you're not executing well and not delivering it on time and on schedule.","Phil Gresh","Okay, understood. Second question on Chemicals. Obviously, you've highlighted multiple times the macro pressures that you're seeing here. Some of your peers have been highlighting this as well. What's your latest thoughts as we look out into 2020 and considering the $200 million or so of earnings each of the past two quarters, there is \u2013 it looks like there is some higher maintenance in the next few quarters, but just generally, what's your kind of view of 2020 relative to the run rate of recent quarters? Thank you.","Neil Hansen","I appreciate it, Phil. Yes, I think the \u2013 if you look at polyethylene industry margin, they are relatively steady versus the second quarter, but they absolutely remain weak due to industry supply length. And that has continued to be the issue. We don't expect that current market environment to improve certainly before the end of this year, but we are starting to see some competitors delay or cancel investment plans and that certainly could impact supply demand balances in 2020.","And the other thing we're seeing that's important is that demand remains robust. And certainly, if you have delays in capacity additions and we continue to see strong demand growth, that could impact margins going forward 2020 plus. The other thing in a cyclical business, we try to focus on the long-term fundamentals, and in the Chemical business, they remain very strong. We expect growth to remain above GDP as the middle-class continues to grow. So that's certainly a key element of it and we focus on those long-term fundamentals.","The other thing is, we recognize that in a cyclical business, in a commodity business, you win over the long term, with the lowest cost of supply. And so when we make these investments, I mentioned the steam cracker in Corpus Christi, we endeavor and do everything we can to keep those projects on the left hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that they are resilient to different price and margin environments. And that certainly is the case with our Chemical portfolio.","The other thing we try to gain an advantage is on the product side. As \u2013 our sales growth for the most part is on high-performing products that have some sort of technology barrier, some sort of unique application for our customers. But we can garner a high margin and we can have a strong portfolio of those types of products. So again, I think we feel really good about it.","The other thing I'd highlight, if you look at the recent investments that have come online, the steam cracker on the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont polyethylene expansion I just mentioned, those assets are performing really well. They're running above planned rates and they're accretive to earnings even in a challenging environment. So again, short term, certainly we continue to see pressures due to capacity additions, but long-term demand fundamentals remain strong and we feel like our portfolio is advantaged and well positioned to continue to perform well across the commodity price cycle.","Phil Gresh","Right. Thanks Neil.","Neil Hansen","Yes. Thank you, Phil.","Operator","And now we'll go to Jon Rigby with UBS.","Jon Rigby","Thank you. Hi, Neil, Two questions.","Neil Hansen","Jon?","Jon Rigby","Hi. Couple of questions. The first on the Downstream. I mean, you referenced, I mean the improving crack spreads, light-heavy spreads for products that I guess would fit exactly into the kind of profile of the new projects that you brought on for the hydrofiner, the coker, the Rotterdam hydrocracker. And I'm a little surprised we're still not really seeing significant delta in earnings over and above the sort of more generic stuff you're highlighting in the 8-K. And I wondered is that just materiality or would \u2013 if was revisited at 4Q and looked at across 2019 versus 2018, would we start to see the effect of those start-ups within your earnings?","And then maybe, if I ask a second question as well. Just on the guidance on disposal proceeds, is that a figure persisting that you will receive or is that growth of selling cost taxes, etc? Thank you.","Neil Hansen","Yes. Thanks, Jon. Let me take the Downstream question first. You're absolutely right. This \u2013 when we make investments, when we consider how we want to transact within our portfolio, we remain very grounded in the long-term fundamentals. And the long-term fundamentals in the Downstream are that you will see a shift in demand away from products like fuel oil into distillates and to base stocks and into chemical feedstocks.","So the investments we're making and have made, certainly Antwerp, Rotterdam are good examples, the Singapore resid upgrade project that I mentioned earlier, all of those are intended to capture the growth in that demand and improve the complexity of our refineries and the competitiveness of those refineries. We are absolutely investing to capture that long-term demand growth.","Again, I \u2013 it's relatively early days in some of these major projects that have come online. They are performing well. They, obviously, have been in a different \u2013 in a lower-margin environment up to this point, but operationally, they're performing well which is impressive especially in some cases, like Rotterdam where that project was reliant on new technology, new catalyst technology that allows us to upgrade again, fuel oil into higher distillate project.","So the fact that we've been able to execute their project well, execute it with new technology is pretty impressive and we feel very good about that. And we fully expect over time, especially if the margin environment improves, that we'll see significant contributions from those projects. I think beyond that \u2013 beyond the major projects, we continue to progress a lot of smaller capital projects at our refineries and we're constantly looking to optimize how we use those units. So again, I would fully anticipate as things progress, we will continue to see good progress and we will endeavor to try and highlight that more certainly in the earnings.","In terms of the proceeds, the $15 billion objective we set out to 2021, that number is consideration. And so, to the extent we have divestments, transactions that include closing adjustments that would obviously reduce that number in terms of the actual cash flow that comes in. But the $15 billion is consideration. The other thing I'd remind you is that it was a risk number. So certainly in terms of the level of activity should we succeed and transacting on everything, it would bring in a lot more consideration than that $15 billion.","It's progressing well. To be a $5 billion already, we feel good about the assets that are being marketed in terms of interest, and we expect to continue to put more assets in the market as we get close to the end of the year.","Jon Rigby","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Hi, guys. Good morning, and good morning everybody.","Neil Hansen","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Neil, I wonder if I could change tack, just a little bit and ask you what the latest update is at Groningen. Obviously, you highlighted the seasonal rebound in gas production or BOEs going into the fourth quarter. But obviously there's been a fair amount of news again in the last several months. And specifically, what I really want to get to target, if I may ask, is the make-whole provisions of the force majeure. So even though longer-term production may be curtailed earlier, what's happening to your \u2013 the net value and the net cash margin to Exxon as a consequence of that as we look longer-term?","Neil Hansen","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the question. Maybe just to give a little bit of background on what's happened in Groningen. So first of all, we certainly understand concerns of residents that have experienced earth tremors and the related damage, and if you go back about a little more than a year ago, we signed a Heads-of-Agreement with the Dutch government and Shell our partner and NAM that would accelerate the end of production I think by 2030, at the latest is the initial. That was the initial timeframe. There was another tremor that occurred in May of this year, and after that tremor, the Dutch government informed us of their intentions to bring production to zero by 2022.","Now that change in the acceleration of the production we see as a significant departure from the Heads-of-Agreement that we signed roughly a year or so ago. So we, along with Shell in the state, have agreed for the need to put in place an addendum to that agreement, and we will work responsibly to accelerate the lowering of the production. And we think we will come to a final agreement on compensation. But that's something that's under way, Doug.","I think what this highlights certainly is the advantage of having a global portfolio that provides you with a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility. Things are going to come in and out of the portfolio, but we anticipate certainly to be able to continue to grow the overall value of that portfolio. Just to give you some sense, I don't have specific, Doug, on earnings and cash, but the production levels are about 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day on an annual basis. It does depend heavily in any given quarter, on demand and weather conditions. But we don't anticipate any significant impact from this accelerated production in the fourth quarter, but we'll certainly work closely with all stakeholders to wind down production in accordance with the desires of the Dutch government.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the lengthy answer, Neil. My second one is probably a quick-one. Given your history and being able to answer these, but I just wonder if there is any update you can give on the Guyana project visibility? I mean clearly, you've got the Analyst Day coming up in March, but you've had extraordinary success again, and I'm specifically trying to see if you will give us any color on what you've learned so far on Ranger, because clearly that's a potential game changer, again, in terms of development timeline. And I'll leave with that. Thanks so much.","Neil Hansen","All right, Doug. I'll try to exceed your expectations. So the news flow out of Guyana, as you know, continues to be extremely positive. And we talked about Phase 1 and the likelihood that we will have start-up by December. It's been a tremendous success. So I think it's a good reflection on the project management capabilities that we have as an organization to be able to deliver that on time and certainly ahead of schedule.","Phase 2, well-defined FID, engineering construction is progressing well. And then we're working with the government on Phase 3, the Payara project, and expect to have early oil, first oil some time in 2023. So really good progress on those first three phases, we've said that by 2025, we would have at least five FPSOs and roughly 750,000 barrels a day of production. And if you think about where that could be, there are \u2013 certainly, you have the Payara area that we're focused on developing. You've got what we're calling the Eastern \u2013 South Eastern area, which includes all the discoveries we've had around that Turbot area, and I think there has been roughly five discoveries.","And then if you move further East, you have Haimara and then West you have Hammerhead. So those are the possibilities, if you will, around potential fourth and fifth boats. We're still working to define those. I would anticipate sometime in the near future, being able to provide more clarity on where those next boats will be.","One of the challenges that we have given all of the significant exploration success that we've had, is making sure that we take the time to optimize the development. We don't want to rush in a way where we do something we might regret down the future. So as we have all these new discoveries, we want to make sure we're optimizing the right approach to create value, not only for us, but also for all stakeholders involved. And then as you know, on top of that, it's all the undrilled potential. So we're trying to balance progressing those developments, while at the same time making sure that we progress what is becoming an even more attractive portfolio of exploration opportunities. Again, Doug, I would imagine, we will continue to provide clarity sometime in the next several months.","On the Ranger, I don't have as much on Ranger only because we're still in the well location. I think quarrying operations have started. Again, I would expect we'll take those results and we'll be able to integrate them into what we know and the data that we have and we'll be able to provide an update in the future, but I hesitate to give anything, just because we're still on the well location.","Doug Leggate","Neil, I appreciate the long answer. Just to be clear, you're still holding 750,000 in your 2025 targets as a company, right?","Neil Hansen","That for production, yes, Doug, today that is the number we are still using. Again, that's production, that's not capacity of FPSO, that's production in 2025.","Doug Leggate","Yes, I expect we will talk about it next week. Thanks a lot, Neil. I appreciate it.","Neil Hansen","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","All right. Next, we will go to Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.","Biraj Borkhataria","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And a few on your divestment plan. Just a couple on Norway and the assets sold. Could you say how much cash flow or free cash flow you're going to lose from selling those assets? And then also just a clarification, the $600 million tax repaid as part of the sale, is that paid by the buyer or is the repayment from the government? And then I also have a one follow-up, in addition to that. Thanks.","Neil Hansen","Yeah. Good. Thanks Biraj. So really good progress with the divestment program with Norway. In terms of \u2013 I mean, you're thinking about to right in terms of the impact. Certainly there will be an impact to volumes and I think we said production in Norway is roughly 150,000 \u2013 currently 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. There will be an impact on earnings, cash flow, but also a reduction in CapEx, avoidance of CapEx.","And so what we're planning to do, I think instead of providing specifics for every divestment that we do in terms of how that's affecting the overall portfolio, we're going to wait until March and we'll give a more fulsome view of all of the divestments and the impact that's going to have on the overall portfolio. On the cash, the cash refund is a repayment from the government, that $0.6 billion that you referenced.","Biraj Borkhataria","Okay, that's very clear. And just a follow-up. Are you able to disclose what long-term oil and gas prices you used to test for impairments on your balance sheet?","Neil Hansen","I think, like we do with anything \u2013 you're talking about impairments, is that what you said?","Biraj Borkhataria","Impairment testing, yes.","Neil Hansen","Okay. Sorry about that. Monitoring for impairments is something that is an ongoing process, and certainly is something that we follow very closely with U.S. GAAP. I don't think we disclose any specific pricing that we use in terms of conducting those impairments.","We have very, as you would imagine, very stringent processes and controls to make sure we identify any changes and facts or circumstances that would indicate that an asset might not recover its carrying value. That includes annual planning and budgeting that we follow, it includes assessing trends and the underlying commodities, natural gas crude et cetera. And then certainly, if through those processes that we have, we determine that there is some question about asset recoverability and impairment might be required. But again, it\u2019s very strictly controlled certainly we follow U.S. GAAP very closely in doing that.","Biraj Borkhataria","Okay. Thank you.","Neil Hansen","You are welcome. Thank you, Biraj.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.","Paul Cheng","Hey, good morning.","Neil Hansen","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","On the Permian, can you tell us what's the rig number and the frac crew you are running right now. And also in the Delaware Basin, what percent of your position is in the federal land?","Neil Hansen","Great. Thanks for the questions, Paul. In terms of rig and fracs, again, the pace of development continues along with the plans that we laid out. I think at the end of the quarter, Paul, we were at 55 rigs and 10 frac crews. So those are the numbers.","Paul Cheng","Is that net number or just a gross number?","Neil Hansen","No, I think it's a net number, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Okay.","Neil Hansen","Yes, in terms of the Delaware, I don't think I have the percentage of the lands that are federal in the Delaware. I mean, as you know, we have a very large inventory out there, but I don't have a specific number on federal lands.","Paul Cheng","Is that something that you guys will be willing to share, and maybe then offline that you can have someone get back to me?","Neil Hansen","Potentially, I mean, obviously, we would share with everyone, but I'll take it away, Paul and certainly and have a discussion whether or not that's something we want to share. Happy to do that.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Second question. In your \u2013 you have a lot of coker and as you show in your presentation. Have you guys tried to run the high sulfur resid or the major component of that directly as a feedstock into your coker in this pacing heavy oil? If you have, and be able to do it, what is the quantity, maybe given the right economic, you will be able to run?","Neil Hansen","Yes, thanks for the question, Paul. We have roughly 450,000 barrels a day of coking capacity. But we also have a lot of flexibility to fill the capacity and we can do that, certainly through heavy crude processing, we can do straight run, resid processing and we can do direct import of Vacuum Tower Bottoms and fuel oil. But in terms of how we feed that or we determine what goes into the cokers, we try to optimize the coker feed slate based on economics, based on availability and based on quality of the feedstocks.","So we do have the capability. I think giving you a specific number wouldn't be helpful, because it will change depending on what's the appropriate \u2013 what's the most optimal crude slate to run or what the optimal slate to run through those cokers. But I will say I think \u2013 when you think about IMO 2020, the key economic drivers is likely to be crude oil differentials and our efforts to optimize the feed slate. And I think the general mechanism for that economic value will be the use of less expensive heavy-sour crudes.","So we anticipate that's likely to keep the cokers full, providing advantage for us. But we certainly have the flexibility and capability to respond to the market and use any of those different kinds of feeds slates, but again, it's hard to give you a specific number, just because it depends on what the market is telling us.","Paul Cheng","Then maybe let me ask you in another way. One of the major refined data set technology-wise that, yes, there is no problem that \u2013 to run it, but in certain \u2013 in many occasions, they are just being constrained by the logistic infrastructure arrangement. So I guess, my question to you is that in your coastal refinery, whether you its Baytown and all that, do you have the capability to receive large quantity of receipt if the economic is there?","Neil Hansen","Yes, I really would agree with that. Certainly, technology-wise and capability-wise we can do it. I think it's fair to say, you can be limited by logistics. But we are, again, that would be part of the consideration of whether or not you use fuel oil in the coker. But again, it's somewhat limited, but I wouldn't say it's completely constrained. We do have the ability and have had the opportunity to run those in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Europe. So there is flexibility there, there may be some constraints on logistics, but not enough to say you couldn't do it if the market told you that's the right thing to do.","Paul Cheng","And final question, Corpus Christi crude export capacity. Neil, do you have a rough estimate what is the current export volume and how much in the near term we would be able to push it before the Southern Gateway Terminal stop?","Neil Hansen","You are talking about export capacity of crude?","Paul Cheng","Crude oil export capacity, yes, in Corpus Christi. With all the new pipeline from Permian going down, is there a concern that, that become a bottleneck and we couldn't export the oil?","Neil Hansen","Yes. I certainly understand the concern. Obviously, as production continues to grow in the Permian, there is only so much of that, that will be consumed by industry on the Gulf Coast with manufacturing both refining and chemical capacity. But today, including us, we've been able to export crudes outside of the Gulf Coast into our refineries in Europe and Asia. Again, I don't know if there is any view on near-term constraints. I fully expect that as you see growth coming out of the Permian, that the industry will respond to that and I think is responding to that and building out additional export capacity, but I don't think we anticipate any near-term constraints on the ability to export out of Gulf Coast.","So one of the things we have done, Paul, as you know, we're certainly investing to increase our capacity on the Gulf Coast to run more of the light crudes out of the Permian, including the Beaumont expansion that we're doing. And I think there's a few other smaller expansions at other refineries that we have to be able to run more of those light crudes. We're certainly able to take advantage of it in our facilities and export it out to our refineries, so no constraints currently. And again, we would anticipate the industry would continue to respond to the additional lines coming out of the Permian.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Neil Hansen","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","All right. We'll next go to Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Boyd","Hi, Neil. Good morning.","Neil Hansen","Good morning, Dan. How are you?","Dan Boyd","Doing well, thanks. I just wanted to kind of follow back on the Permian where you say you're kind of trending as according to plan. But you are at 10 frac crews and I think your plan was to go from 11 at the beginning of the year to 16 at an exit rate. So, are you seeing more efficiency on the frac crew side because your production is running ahead of plan? I'm just wondering what this signals? Are you going to be increasing completions going forward or are you able to just do more with less?","Neil Hansen","I think \u2013 broadly and certainly for us, I think you are seeing more efficient production out in the Permian. And I think a fewer number of frac crews would be indicative of that. But I think even if you look at what's happening in industry rigs, certainly have flattened and even come down, but you see continued growth in volumes. And I think that's indicative of improved productivity, indicative of longer lateral lengths, indicative of using more and more effective rigs. So I think not only for us, but I think certainly in the industry, you're starting to see more, more efficiency.","But at the same time, it's not a heterogeneous resource and I think that's where we bring advantages by being able to apply sophisticated reservoir modeling. We're able to, I think, optimize how we're developing optimize things like spacing. Our ability to understand the sub-surface allows us to tailor the development to our understanding of the geology. And so I think still relatively early, I think you're going to see us continue to learn. I think you're going to continue to see us optimize how we're approaching the development.","So I wouldn't read too much into any specific number around frac crews or rigs. Again it isn't about volume for us. This is about what we need to do to create value for our shareholder and so we're going to respond to what we're learning, we're going to respond to the application of technology and drilling expertise and project management capabilities to make sure that over time, we're achieving that objective of creating value.","Dan Boyd","Okay, thanks. And then we talked about this one before, but we now look at your operating cash flow year-to-date versus the plan back in March. You may be running about, call it, $12 billion to $14 billion shy of that. Obviously we've been in a tough macro environment, but I was wondering, can you help us understand how much of that shortfall versus plan is purely related to price, and how much is potentially related to operations. We talked about increased maintenance, because what I'm trying to figure out here is, is there are potential for the next couple of quarters to get back on track and is there an operational catch-up that we might see?","Neil Hansen","Yes. I appreciate the question. We're obviously in a much different market environment than the basis that we use for that Investor Day, especially in Downstream and Chemical. So when we look at how we're performing relative to those numbers, if you adjust for that impact, if you adjust for the fact that we're in a very different environment, we're generally pleased with where we are. We have had as you highlighted, some operational challenges, which have been a detriment to that. But broadly speaking, we feel very pleased if you were to adjust for that environment.","Maybe more importantly, Dan, as we continue to have tremendous success on operational milestones. And we highlighted the liquids growth reaching 10 FIDs this year alone, the additional exploration discoveries. So we feel really good about the progress we're making on the underlying investments that will grow the earnings and cash flow generation capacity of the organization over time.","So, I think again, for the most part, we feel pretty good both on earnings and cash flow with the exception that we're just \u2013 we happen to be in a different environment. But we fully anticipate given that we are investing with structural advantages, we're not relying on market help that over time, those will begin to manifest themselves as we get into different price and margin environments.","Dan Boyd","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Neil Hansen","Thanks Dan. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Great. We'll take that question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.","Jason Gabelman","Yes, hey. Thanks for taking the question here, past the hour. I wanted to address the Mosaic agreement. It wasn't really discussed on the call yet. I mean, you guys have talking \u2013 have talked about carbon capture for a little while now. And there is obviously concern in the journal investment community that all the resource you own, will not be able to be developed, because of concerns around greenhouse gas. So your ability to develop a breakthrough technology, I think would go a long way. Can you just discuss the prospects of that technology and kind of where do you see that impacting the business, and maybe the carbon emission profile? And I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Neil Hansen","Jason, that's a good question to end the call on. Look \u2013 I mean, let me be clear. First of all, we recognize the risks from climate change and we recognize that something has to be done about it. And we are committed to providing affordable reliable energy, while minimizing the impact on the environment, and that's specifically the need to reduce CO2 emissions. If you look at that, 90% of global energy emissions come from three sectors, comes from power generation, transportation and the industrial sector. And the challenge that we face is, finding a comprehensive set of solutions that will allow us to reduce the emissions in those three sectors. But it's going to require advances in technology and it's going to require the implementation of effective policies by government.","So if you look at where we think we can participate in that solution development, is through our advantaged research and development capabilities. And so we are attacking each of those three sectors. So in power generation, you mentioned carbon capturing technology that is going to be critical to help reduce emissions in power generation. We're doing not only internal research and development, but we are also expanding the portfolio outside the company. You mentioned Mosaic. We had a similar agreement with a company called Global Thermostat few months ago. I mentioned all the partnerships we have with universities, national labs, et cetera. So we have a very wide aperture looking for opportunities to develop scalable economic solutions on carbon capture.","The second sector transportation, everyone's aware of the advances being made on the light-duty side, but on the commercial transportation, heavy-duty aviation, we think we need a biofuel solution. And you are, I'm sure, very familiar with our algae program. We're also looking at cellulosic biofuels. And then on the industrial side, that sector we're looking at new plant configurations, new processes, new catalysts. So the way we want to participate, the way we are participating in this, at a level that is much more significant than any of our peers, is leveraging our technology capabilities to come up with those solutions.","And I think we've spent $10 billion on low-emission technologies I think since the year 2000. And then as I mentioned, we continue to advocate for policies. So again, that's why you're seeing us partner with companies like Mosaic, Global Thermostat, because we recognize where those solution gaps exist and we believe new technologies are needed, and we think we have a competitive advantage to participate and find those solutions, while at the same time continuing to create value for our shareholders.","Jason Gabelman","Thanks, I appreciate that answer. If I could just squeeze in a very quick follow-up, you cited the $150 million benefit to Downstream on the clean\/dirty spread. Is there a corresponding impact on the Upstream, just trying to understand the impact to the entire portfolio? Thanks.","Neil Hansen","I appreciate that last question, Jason. It's something we looked at. I mean, obviously we don't want to focus just on the benefit we're getting from the Downstream. So when we look at our Upstream portfolio, this is a good example of having a very large global diverse portfolio, and there will be pluses and minuses in that portfolio as it relates to the implementation of IMO. But when we looked at it, in the end it ended up being a neutral impact. So it really does not have an impact on our Upstream. Again, like I mentioned, you'll see pluses and minuses, but on the overall portfolio, there is a neutral impact.","Neil Hansen","Well, we appreciate everyone allowing us the opportunity to highlight the third quarter and all of the key milestones that we hit, and the continued progress on our portfolio. We look forward to your participation on our fourth quarter earnings call, where I will be joined by our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods. And we appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you everyone again for their participation.

Rosenthal \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations and Secretary","Analysts","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Operator","Good day, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth was mixed throughout the first quarter. U.S. growth was flat to moderate and economic indicators were mixed. China experienced slower growth and the European economies remain challenged.","Energy markets strengthened in the first quarter with higher crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices. U.S. natural gas prices remained relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter. Industry refining margins strengthened and we experienced improved chemical commodity product margins.","Turning now to the first quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings were $9.5 billion, an increase of $50 million from the first quarter of 2012. Earnings per share for the quarter were $2.12, up $0.12 or 6% from a year-ago. The corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was used to purchase shares.","Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share, a 10.5% increase from the last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $4 billion in the second quarter of 2013.","CapEx in the first quarter was $11.8 billion, up $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to the $3.1 billion Celtic acquisition. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $14 billion. At the end of the first quarter 2013, cash totaled $6.6 billion and debt was $13.4 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $9.9 billion to $6.6 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E up $7.5 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.6 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.2 billion primarily reflecting the Celtic acquisition.","Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings of $9.5 billion increased $50 million from the first quarter of 2012. Higher chemical earnings and lower corporate and financing expenses due primarily to favorable tax items were mostly offset by lower Upstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","As shown on Slide 7, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings decreased by $450 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partly offset by higher Chemical earnings and lower corporate and financing expenses.","Moving next to first quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 8, we continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality Upstream projects. Extraction of bitumen froth at the Kearl plant facilities began March 31 and we are beginning to process the bitumen froth. We will be filling onsite tankers with diluted bitumen and will transport the product to market with the new pipeline.","Start-up of an operation of this size and scope is a sequential process involving multiple integrated systems. Our first priority is completing start-up activity safely which includes mitigating the impacts of abnormally cold weather of both workers and equipment. Production from the initial development is expected to reach volumes of approximately 110,000 barrels of bitumen per day later this year.","Progress also continues on the Kearl expansion project, which was 32% complete at the end of the first quarter. Fabrication and assembly of pipe rack and equipment modules in Edmonton is ahead of plan, and we have completed setting the main pipe rack modules in the froth treatment plant, also ahead of plan. The project remains on schedule for startup in 2015.","During the quarter, we also started production from the Telok gas field located offshore Malaysia in the South China Sea. The development concept of divide one, design one, build multiple was utilized to efficiently develop the project and shorten construction and installation timeline allowing Telok to be completed on schedule and within budget. The Telok A platform is the first phase of the Telok natural gas project which when completed will consist of two four-legged gas satellite platforms. A total of 14 development wells are planned for the Telok A and B platforms.","In the Gulf of Mexico, appraisal drilling at Hadrian North has been completed and the results are being integrated into development planning for the Hadrian North project. In addition, the Erha North Phase II project in Nigeria was sanctioned during the quarter. The project is located 60 miles offshore Nigeria and consist of the Subsea tieback to the existing Erha floating, production, storage and offloading vessel. It is anticipated to recover approximately 175 million barrels of oil with the peak capacity of 60,000 barrels of oil per day. Startup is targeted for 2016.","Turning now to Slide 9 and an update on our conventional exploration activities; in Tanzania, we completed two successful wells during the quarter. The Tangawizi-1 well discovered gas and high-quality Tertiary sandstone reservoirs confirming 4 Tcf to 6 Tcf of gas in place. This new discovery is located 10 kilometers from the Zafarani and Lavani discoveries.","In addition, the Zafarani-2 well confirmed gas-bearing, high-quality reservoir in cretaceous appraisal target. We have so far completed five successful wells on Block 2. Exploration efforts continue and additional drilling is planned for later this year. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Phobos prospect encountered approximately 250 net feet of oil pay in the Lower Tertiary-aged reservoirs. As you know, we plan to drill several wells in the Gulf of Mexico this year. Our next prospect, Thorn will begin drilling in the second quarter.","Moving now to Slide 10; also during the quarter, we made several substantial additions of high-quality acreage to our exploration portfolio. We expanded the strategic co-operation agreement with Rosneft to include an additional 150 million acres from seven new blocks in the Chukchi, Laptev and Kara Sea of the Russian Arctic.","We are now working with Rosneft on 180 million acres in the Russian Arctic, including the original 31 million acres in the Kara Sea. These lots cover some of the most promising and least explored acreage in the world. In West Africa, we acquired an 80% interest in Liberia Block 13, comprising more than 625,000 acres offshore and water depths ranging from 75 meters to 3,000 meters. Block 13 is located 30 kilometers offshore Liberia\u2019s central coast.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we added high quality acreage to our deepwater portfolio. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management awarded Exxon Mobil, the four blocks for which we were the high bidder in the Western Gulf of Mexico OCS lease sale 229. In a recent central lease sale 227, Exxon Mobil was the high bidder for seven blocks. Additionally, we acquired a 33% working interest from BP to reform into the Maui prospect located in the Walker Ridge area. Exxon Mobil will provide a state-of-the-art deepwater drilling rig and will operate the Maui-1 exploration well expected to spud in the second half of this year.","Turning now to our unconventional activities on Slide 11, we continue to progress high-potential, liquids-rich unconventional opportunities. During the quarter, we closed the Celtic acquisition bringing 545,000 net acres of liquids-rich Montney Shale, a 104,000 net acres in the Duvernay Shale, and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta into our unconventional portfolio.","Although it\u2019s very early days, we are rapidly integrating personnel, systems and processes leveraging both our own extensive unconventional expertise and our long operating experience in Canada. We are currently developing future drilling plans to focus on areas expected to deliver the highest liquids yield and to optimize both drilling and completion methodologies.","In the Bakken, gross operated production increased 75% year-on-year with the growth attributable to increased development and optimized completions across our core Bakken acreage. We are utilizing 10 drilling rigs in the Bakken and have fully integrated the acquired Denbury properties into our operations. In the liquids-rich, Woodford Ardmore Shale play rose operated production increased 39% year-on-year.","The Ardmore is our most active unconventional play, with 12 operated rigs delineating more than 270,000 acres in the Ardmore and Marietta Basins. We have absorbed encouraging early results from our first well in the Marietta Basin since coming online a year-ago. After the successful 2012 test of the over-lined Caney Shale in our core Ardmore area, we are progressing with further delineation across both the Ardmore and the Marietta areas.","We also continue well testing and execution of drilling plants in Argentina and Colombia. In Russia, we planned to begin operations in West Siberia later this year.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Side 12, Upstream earnings in the first quarter were just over $7 billion, down $765 million from the first quarter of 2012. Lower crude oil realizations partly offset by improved natural gas realizations, negatively impacted earnings by $230 million. As crude oil realizations declined $8.66 per barrel, while gas realizations increased $0.97 per 1000 cubic feet.","Production volume and mix effects negatively impacted earnings by $280 million. All other items including higher expenses related to new project activity, decreased earnings by $250 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the first quarter of 2013 were $17.79.","Moving to Side 13, our first quarter volume performance is in line with the projection presented at the Analyst Meeting in March. Oil equivalent volumes decreased by 3.5% from the first quarter of last year; excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments production was down about 1%.","Liquids production was down 21,000 barrels per day or just below 1% from the first quarter of 2012 as field decline was mostly offset by project ramp up in West Africa and increased production from liquids rich plays in the United States. Natural gas production was down 823 million cubic feet per day or just under 6% quarter-on-quarter as lower entitlement volumes primarily reflecting [cutter] AKG becoming cost current in 2012 and field decline are partially offset by lower downtime and higher seasonal demand in Europe.","Turning out to the sequential comparison and starting on Slide 14, Upstream earnings decreased by $725 million versus the fourth quarter of 2012. Realizations positively impacted earnings by $340 million as crude oil and natural gas realizations increased by $1.68 per barrel and $0.94 per thousand cubic feet respectively. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $80 million as the unfavorable timing of lifting and two fewer days in the quarter were mostly offset by higher natural gas volumes in Europe and Asia.","Other items including the absence of gains from asset sales and favorable tax items realized in the fourth quarter decreased earnings by $980 million. Moving to Slide 15, oil equivalent volumes were up 2.4% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up more than 4%.","Liquids production was down 10,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter as unfavorable entitlement volumes were mostly offset by lower downtime. Natural gas production was up 672 million cubic feet per day versus last quarter, primarily reflecting higher seasonal demand in Europe.","Moving now to the Downstream, financial and operating results and starting on Slide 16, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, down $41 million from the first quarter of 2012.","Improved margins mainly in refining increased earnings by $780 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $290 million mainly due to increased refinery maintenance activity. All other items decreased earnings by $530 million including lower gains on asset sales outside of the United States, the increased operating expenses associated with refinery maintenance activity and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.","Turning to Slide 17, sequentially first quarter Downstream earnings declined by $223 million, improved margins mainly in refining increased earnings by $470 million, volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $430 million mainly driven by increased refinery maintenance activity. Other items reduced earnings by $260 million due primarily to the absence of a fourth quarter LIFO gain.","Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 18; first quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, up $436 million versus the first quarter of 2012. Stronger commodity margins increased earnings by $320 million, reflecting improved U.S. steam cracking margins on lower ethylene feed cost. All other items increased earnings by $120 million mainly due to increased gains on asset sales.","Moving to Slide 19, sequentially first quarter Chemical earnings increased by $179 million, stronger margins mainly in U.S. commodities increased earnings by $80 million. Lower operating expenses and higher gains from asset sales partly offset by the absence of a prior year quarter LIFO gain increased earnings by a net $90 million.","In conclusion, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter financial and operating performance reflects the value of our strong integrated business model. In the first quarter, we earned $9.5 billion, generated $14 billion in cash flow, invested $11.8 billion in the business and distributed $7.6 billion to our shareholders. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploying high impact technologies and leverage our unmatched global integration, Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, David. How are you?","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Doug. How are you?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I love the short name I get on these calls. Anyway two quick questions please. The unit profitability David on the Upstream continues to like the historical capture rate. Can you comment as to whether or something that materially has changed there and if I guess a couple of years ago we talked about start of the LNG trends, is there anything specific you can point to that is back on track to where we\u2019ve been historically?","David S. Rosenthal","I think if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last couple of years as you\u2019ve noted, the change in the mix in particular the addition of the U.S. gas volumes particularly over the period when prices were down in the $2 and some range, you saw the mix impacting the unit profitability relative to the historical trend.","As we go forward, when you look at the longer term and you look at the liquids increases that we have coming on and the higher gas prices that we have seen, you could reasonably expect the profitability to reflect those increases in the both the production as well as the margins. I think one of the other things to keep in mind is we crank up these new projects again is going to be the addition of long-term plateau volumes and the lower decline rate.","So as the decline rate levels out and you are not chasing the decline that we had in prior years you won\u2019t be investing as much money to keep the production levels where they are. I think the other thing that\u2019s positive as we look down the road again in addition to the liquids increase that we\u2019ve talked about in the Analyst Meeting and the increase we\u2019re projecting this year and going forward.","The LNG project that we have coming on stream in the next few years are all sold with the gas linked under long-term contracts to crude oil prices. So if again it gets back to the longer-term looking at the projects that we have coming on this year, and in the next few years and the relative profitability of those projects and again over the long-term, I\u2019m very confident in the robustness of those projects and our ability to bring them on stream and get those barrels to market.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. My follow-up hopefully a quick one; somebody is go to ask you, David the share buybacks $14 billion of cash flow; you\u2019re not covering the cash outflow. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re signaling to I mean is this oil spill over $100 and you\u2019re cutting the buyback program, my recollection is you\u2019re not using the planning assumptions, any color you can give us would be appreciated?","David S. Rosenthal","","Doug, let me hit from a couple of perspectives. First, when you look at the cash flow in the quarter as you saw from the sources and uses of funds, we had basically a zero impact on working capital in any prior quarters, we have positive impacts there. We did close and pay the $3 billion for the Celtic acquisition; we also had some timing of tax payments and that sort of thing. So but the cash flow again is just an outcome of the earnings give or take these timing effects.","As we said in terms of the buyback, I have to tell you there is no change in our approach to capital allocation and the use of our cash flow as you saw, we once again raise the dividend here and Board announced that yesterday 10.5% this year following on the 21% increase last year, so we continue to raise the dividend on a consistent basis. And then the share buyback is strictly a function of cash flows in the quarter and expectations going forward in the quarters, but no change in terms of signal or the way that we approach the allocation of the fund.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks a lot, David.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Terreson with ISI.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","","Dave, can you hear me?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure, I can. Hi.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi, how are you? So my question is also on Upstream profitability and I\u2019m just going to ask a little bit of a different way and specifically on the international side meaning your point is taken on U.S. natural gas and the benefits of some of these large LNG projects over longer term, but internationally between flat realizations versus last year plus or minus in Rex\u2019s comments on declining drilling and completion cost in March, I just want to say if you could maybe provide a little bit more color on some of the volume and mix effects components on the international side that you highlighted in Exhibit 12 and maybe also whether or not there is a geographical aspect of the mix effect to work here.","David S. Rosenthal","If you look at the \u2013 on the international side and you take a look at the profitability, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing there is a mixed impact with some of the losses, some of the higher margin barrels from the production sharing contracts that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years and then the mix certainly when you get into \u2013 in this part of the year of European gas sales.","So nothing structural, nothing really to point out other than some mix effect, but again if you look over a longer period of time at the projects, we have coming online and the earnings contribution that those will make, I don\u2019t think you will see any major change to talk about relative to prior history.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","We will take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, Dave. Good morning.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, Paul. How are you?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Very good. Two questions, one can you give us \u2013 what is your 2013 CapEx on the North American share volume pay and versus that if not absolute but versus 2012 and what\u2019s the expectation for 2014?","David S. Rosenthal","Paul, I couldn\u2019t hear you. Could you just repeat the question on the U.S. CapEx?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Right. Yes, two questions. First for North American share volume, can you share with us what is the actual CapEx for this year related to those basin and you cannot give us an actual that can you tell us what is that comparing to 2012 and also if you can give us an idea that what is the expectation for 2014 if that is going to be higher or is going to be staying at that level? Second, do you want to answer that and then I go for the second question.","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, how about I answer that one and then we will go to your second question. As you look at our, I don\u2019t have a specific actual CapEx outlook number for you, but as we\u2019ve talked about, as you see our focus in drilling in the unconventional plays and in particular the liquids rich plays in the Bakken in the Woodford Ardmore, we are allocating an additional amount of CapEx to those areas relative to what we would be allocating to dry gas.","And clearly as we integrate the Denbury acquisition that we did, the Celtic acquisition that we did; it is reasonable to expect that on a relative basis year-to-year over time, we will be spending more money on those liquids rich plays and you\u2019re starting to see some of that bear out.","If you look at the improved performance in the Bakken and in the Woodford Ardmore, not only in the production that\u2019s coming up, but the efficiency that we\u2019re getting improved completions, improved performance, that strategy and that approach is starting to play-out and you\u2019re starting to see the dividend.","In terms of going forward, 2014, again I don\u2019t have a specific outlook for you but it would be reasonable to assume that as we continue to progress these liquids based opportunities and continue to drill the wells and have the activity that we\u2019re having and leveraging the ability we\u2019re getting now with these additional properties, certainly as we ramp that up, you could expect on a relative basis over time for the CapEx to go up, but I don\u2019t have a specific actual amount for you.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Dave just curious I guess see $3 billion or $4 billion currently you\u2019re spending. Is that a ballpark, it is reasonable estimate of SME or that you\u2019re not going to be able to come in even on that?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t, again I wouldn\u2019t want to give an actual number allocated to one particular resource types and one particular geography other than again to call to reiterate that clearly we have increased the focus on the liquids rich plays and we continue to ramp-up that activity and in particular as we move from the delineation and appraisal phase into the development phase and start bringing wealth online and getting them to sales.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, (inaudible) hopefully that really at the tail end of the Phase 1 start up phase. Just I want to see that you learn a lot since that you guys have never done the mining project, and so what steps that you have taken or what experience that you have learned? Now you have tied to Phase II, so that you can ensure that you\u2019re just going to $1 million budget and the start up schedule?","David S. Rosenthal","","Paul, let me first comment on the Kearl start up. Literally the actual production is eminent and so we\u2019ll be looking forward to that here shortly as I mentioned in my remarks. In terms of lessons learned and applying those to the Kearl expansion project, the one thing you need to recall is we are partners in the Syncrude project and therefore have a lot of experience in that operation and are actually quite familiar with bitumen mining.","I think the real carryover that you get as you move from the Kearl initial project development to the Kearl expansion project is the ability to carryover all the engineering work from the first section. I think we mentioned before about 90% of the engineering carries over. The new trains are being build adjacent to the existing ones. And so it\u2019s really the efficiency that you get in building a second train \u2013 second set of trains right behind the original project and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see there.","And in fact if you look at where we are today and the progress that we made, we are actually ahead of schedule right now on the expansion project. So I think that\u2019s what you will see in the real efficiency. Now clearly having said that, as we progress with the mine development, it will be natural for us to find improvement opportunities as we go along and learn some things and continue to develop the mine plan and heading into the expansion.","But in terms of starting from ground zero or low starting point, I don\u2019t think, I\u2019d characterize it that way, but again as you know us, we\u2019ll be continuously improving everything we\u2019re doing as we start-up and ramp up the current project and then head into the next phase.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you. Dave, can I just stick in with a short question for clarification, in your earlier comments for 2013 production guidance that given the March for 1% to 2%, is that already factored in the potential PSC impact based on $110 brand or that is not included?","David S. Rosenthal","","Yes, the impact of PSC effects at the $112 price that we used is in that estimates that we showed you. So to be very specific, if you look at the 2% increase in liquids that we had, we had the PSC effects in there at the assume price.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Hi, David.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning Iain, how are you?","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Yeah, I\u2019m doing very well. Couple of questions, well first question on the Downstream if I could. You had a very strong performance in U.S. Downstream relative to where the margins seem to go. And also probably a weaker performance in our non-US Downstream, do you want to talk about the kind of drivers there like were you accessing more advantage crude in the U.S. perhaps and we estimated and some international Downstream was relatively driving that one, which kind of offset what the benefits you got in the U.S.?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, if you\u2019re looking at the Downstream, in particular if you\u2019re looking, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re actually referring to our quarter-over-quarter or sequential.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Well both really.","David S. Rosenthal","If you look at both, yes, we saw a very strong refining margins in particular in the U.S. and that really does reflect the advantage feeds that we\u2019re doing, that we\u2019re running into those, plus the fact that we had good uptime, and reliability and good performance in the operations.","So that has come along as we talked about in the Analyst Meeting in March and we\u2019re seeing those benefits. I will say if you are looking at the sequential quarter-to-quarter delta there was helped by the absence of some unfavorable price timing that we had in the fourth quarter. So if you\u2019re looking sequentially, and you look at that nice bump, in U.S. earnings, a good bit of it is actual margin improvement and the other is in absence of prior quarter\u2019s unfavorable price timing that I mentioned.","If you\u2019re looking overseas, and if you\u2019re looking at the Downstream business, the biggest impact you see there is the significant increase in maintenance activity, in our refineries particularly in Europe and in Canada and that\u2019s the bulk of what you\u2019re seeing in both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter.","Driving those results we did have a little negative 4X impact, as well. And then again the absence, if you\u2019re looking sequentially the absence of the LIFO gain that we had in the non-US from the fourth quarter.","So I think if you step back and look at all of this and just take out the LIFO gains and asset sales that we had talked about in the fourth quarter as well, the operations are running great, we\u2019re taking advantage of the feeds that are available particularly here in the U.S. and continuing to benefit from the integration that we have across our refining and chemicals businesses. I think you\u2019re seeing all that really come to fruition particularly in the margin area.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And second one, you\u2019re obviously building up now significant further volumes in Canadian bitumen. And we\u2019ve seen the differential there widened even further in the first quarter. Can you talk about how Exxon is impacted by market differentials there? I think you said at the Analyst Meeting that you thought you could take advantage if you like of your own pipeline systems to get around some of that. Do you just want to flush that out a bit?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. If you look at our refining footprints and what we call an extended mid time if you will, so if you look at our refineries in the Midwest, in the Rockies and in Canada, we can process about 600,000 barrels a day of that advantage crude that you see in that part of the business. Now, when you come back specifically to the Kearl project as we have said before, we are capable of sending all of the output from the initial development project into our existing refining circuit. So to the extent that differentials continue, we will be able to capture those in our own refining circuit.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. So obviously into the second phase, which you\u2019re going to have some problems with that?","David S. Rosenthal","No, when you look at the second phase, we will be looking at both the opportunity to run more of that crude into our existing refineries as well as obvious into third party. So we are working those logistics now looking at our various options and opportunities we got till 2015, but we are pretty confident when we look across our broad logistics capability in our refining circuit that we\u2019ll be able to place those barrels in an optimum manner and extract the maximum value from those products.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. So we should be expecting maybe lower E&P earnings from Kearl, but Downstream earnings for the whole mix comes out in the ore.","David S. Rosenthal","Well, I think that it will all depend on the absolute level of crude prices and margins and then the differentials as well. I can\u2019t predict what either of those will be at a given time. I think the real message though is that whatever the absolute prices and margins are at the time, we are going to get a benefit from being fully integrated both across the refining chemicals business and in that integration into Kearl and the ability to process other crudes including disadvantage imports like crudes in the U.S. and that sort of thing.","So it is really optimizing across the entire circuit as well as geographic optimizations but we feel pretty good about where we are and how our assets match up and how we are managing those and look forward to benefiting more as we go forward with this integration.","","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Okay. And just one very quick one, if you don\u2019t mind, you talked about asset guiding chemicals, is that \u2013 are we talking on an absolute basis hundreds of millions of dollars there, like how much is that in terms of improving chemical earnings?","David S. Rosenthal","Kind of all in just under a $100 million.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Okay, all right. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much indeed.","David S. Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Hi guys, question on two of your exploration areas. First in Tanzania, I realized you are not the operator but you have had a lot of success there. And is there \u2013 do you envision a point maybe in the next 12 months of sanctioning a development plan?","","David S. Rosenthal","I think if you step back and take a look at Tanzania, we have had significant success there with the wells that we\u2019ve drilled so far both the exploration wells and the recent appraisal well. So far, we\u2019re looking at gas resources somewhere in the range of 10 Tcf to 13 Tcf discovered to date. But as we look forward, we got a lot of work left to do, we\u2019ve got a lot more seismic that we\u2019re running and processing, lot more analysis to do, we are looking at drilling an additional well later this year. So we\u2019ve got to take all of that into account before we can never really start thinking about development plan.","So it\u2019s still early days, we know we\u2019ve got a very high quality resource, we\u2019ve had a significant amount of early success, there is more exploration work ahead and once we finish the exploration and appraisal process and know what we got and know how whether it\u2019s how the commerciality looks, then we would do the natural progression into development planning and that sort of thing. But it\u2019s a little early to \u2013 right now fortunately, it\u2019s early because of all the success we\u2019ve had to date. But we got a little more work to do and once we get all that done, we will be in a better position to talk about our go forward plans.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Appreciate that. And follow-up a little bit bigger picture question on your unconventional opportunities globally, one of your European competitors recently poured some cold water over particularly shale gas development internationally talking about all the obstacles.","And in your [FNL] review, you noted some of the issues in Germany and I mean obviously earlier in Poland. Can I actually get to your kind of latest thoughts on how international ex-North America unconventional fits into your portfolio and what the plan is?","David S. Rosenthal","","Yeah, I think the most important thing to think about, when you look at our international portfolio is how diverse it is. So, if you just kind of walk around the world, we have a very active program underway in Columbia that we\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019re progressing activities there and testing some wells and planning to drill some more. Argentina continues to be a very active area for us. We drilled a number of wells last year that we\u2019re testing and looking at. We have planned to drill a number of more wells in Argentina.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do still intend to get to work in West Siberia over the course of this year and get some work there. So, that\u2019s doing very well and we continue to leverage again the expertise that we have here in North America into those plays.","Having said that, there is prospectivity in Europe and as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we have a very large acreage position in unconventional prospectivity in Germany for both gas and liquids. We are working with the government there to try to get permits that would allow us to continue our exploration and appraisal process. We stand ready to ramp-up activity there, pending that.","So, it\u2019s a long-term business, it\u2019s a long-term resource development, both the oil companies and the countries that have these resources are just getting started with their evaluation programs and developing policies. So, we can pace our activity based on local requirements and regulations and again the good news for us is, we got a very large portfolio in a lot of different areas with a lot of different resource potential and we\u2019re able to dedicate the resources both human and financial and technology to those areas with the most promise and the most availability and accessibility and we\u2019re continuing to do that very well into this year.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","All right, I appreciate the color and all that things.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our next question from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning, David. This is Scott Willis on for Ed.","David S. Rosenthal","Hi, Ed.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","I just want to focus on U.S. natural gas for a minute if I could. I noticed that your domestic volumes were down around 4% quarter-over-quarter and then when we look at natural gas prices, those have been stronger so far in this quarter should those prices go forward, I was just wondering how that would affect your decision to grow your domestic gas volumes going forward?","David S. Rosenthal","Well, I think if you step back and look at the unconventional resource in North America and particularly in the U.S. that we\u2019re working on, as we talked about over the last few quarters we have been allocating and dedicating more resources towards the liquid-rich plays particularly the Woodford Ardmore as I mentioned as well as the Bakken and those efforts are continuing, and we are making great progress in terms of productivity, optimizing the completion, getting the initial rates and extended rates out. And so that effort continues unabated and we will continue to do that.","I think the other news that\u2019s really good for us is the flexibility we have across our unconventional resource. We have as you well know very large positions in all of the unconventional gas plays in the U.S. and we are still maintaining activity in some of the gas plays where the returns are good and we maintain the flexibility to increase our efforts in those areas if we want to.","But when you\u2019re looking at prices in any of the commodities they move around, we don\u2019t tend to take the last two data points and draw the trend line and react in that manner, we tend to have longer term approaches to the development of all of our resources.","So I don\u2019t know what prices are going to do going forward, and I wouldn\u2019t want to predict exactly what we will be doing in any given time other than currently our focus is on the liquids-rich plays, and we are having great success there, but we do maintain a flexibility and optionality in the gas plays as well. So it\u2019s pretty good position to be in, and we\u2019ll continue to work on the long term development and react is appropriate to changes in market factors.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then also just on the asset sales it looks you did around $400 million this quarter, I was just wondering if that is a decent run rate, and how you think the rest of the year will go there if you look to kind of ramp up those asset sales as we go forward?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah it would, I can\u2019t give you any expectation of our run rate, if you look back across the last few years, the asset sales of tended to be lumpy as well as different in certain quarters than the Upstream versus the Downstream. So I wouldn\u2019t want to give you a run rate, we are continually looking at our portfolio is that we always do, but I wouldn\u2019t want to either say any absolute number was appropriate or to give any guidance relative to future quarters or what you\u2019ve seen this quarter or prior quarters it will happen, when it happens.","Scott Willis \u2013 Credit Suisse","Gotcha. Okay, thanks David.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","","Good morning, David.","","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning Robert.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Couple of follow-ups to some earlier points you made. One on the buybacks, you were asked about reduction and the strategy there. But I\u2019d like to ask you about the cash balance and flexibility. So the $6.6 billion of cash that you\u2019ve got on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.","How much of that I guess in theory could be used for buyback? So I know you got about $400 million marked in the footnotes as restricted. But is that to say that a full 6.2 remainder could be used again in theory for buybacks or are there any other factors to consider like taxes on repatriation of cash to the U.S. to the extent you\u2019ve got some of broader or that kind of effect?","David S. Rosenthal","","Well, earlier getting to the last part of your question and backing up. There are a number of factors that determine what our point in cash balances in any quarter, I mentioned some of those this quarter including closing the Celtic acquisition, some timing of tax payments, working capital changes et cetera.","So we don\u2019t have a target in terms of what the cash balance is or a minimum that we have to have or an operating level. We manage the cash just to maintain our flexibility and meet all of our commitments and it does bounce around a fair amount as you\u2019ve seen over time.","But I wouldn\u2019t want to make any specific comment on what cash would be available for what or how it might change going forward. Other than to say as we\u2019ve said before, the share buyback is determined on a quarterly basis, and as a reflection the cash that\u2019s available has delivered from the business given the market conditions that we have. And as I said, our expectation is we\u2019ll buy $4 billion in the second quarter. But other than that, I just wouldn\u2019t have any guidance on either the uses of cash or the buyback level going forward.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Can you say whether the $6 billion figure roughly is fully available for general corporate purposes in any jurisdiction or do you have any sizable amount that can only be used in certain geography?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, I tell you, I wouldn\u2019t have a specific comment on that. But I don\u2019t think there is anything significant or material in any one region or another that\u2019s restricted for us. We manage our cash globally and I wouldn\u2019t expect there to be anything significant or material to worry about or to think about what to do with.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then a quick follow-up from me on the chemical asset sale gain, I mean you mentioned just under $100 million I think in aggregate, can you provide a quick split on U.S. versus non-U.S. for that gain in the first quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah, it\u2019s about half-and-half , half in the U.S. and half overseas and I guess, I said the number was just under $100 million, its in total it\u2019s $70 million and again half in the U.S. and half in the non-U.S.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","And with no further questions, I would like to turn it back to Mr. Rosenthal for any additional or closing remarks.","David S. Rosenthal","Yeah I just like to say in closing, I appreciate your time and your questions this morning and look forward to our call in about three months. So thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Hansen","All right, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is Jack Williams. Jack is a Senior Vice President and Member of the Management Committee. His responsibility is for the projects, organization and the Downstream and Chemical business lines. ","After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Jack will provide his perspectives on the quarter and give updates on the significant progress made in a number of key areas across the business that will generate accretive value for our shareholders. Following Jack\u2019s remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. ","Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investor section of our website. I\u2019d also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation. ","Moving to Slide 3, I\u2019ll now highlight our first quarter financial performance. Over the past few months, we made excellent progress on our growth projects with several key final investment decisions and continued exploration success. We also remain on track with plans to increase production in the Permian Basin to 1 million oil equivalent barrels per day by 2024. ","In fact, growth in the Permian during the quarter supported a 5% year-over-year increase in liquids volumes. The first quarter was also characterized by solid operating performance including the successful execution of scheduled maintenance across a number of our Downstream facilities. ","Impressive progress in the first quarter was achieved in a margin environment that for both the Downstream and Chemical business lines was extremely challenging. ","In addition, North American crude differentials narrowed significantly eliminating the large arbitrage opportunities that our logistics allowed us to capture in the fourth quarter. So, while the fundamentals and demand growth that underpin our investments remain strong. Near-term supply and demand imbalances pressured margins. In fact, in the Downstreams the lowest levels we\u2019ve seen in the last decade.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.55 including a negative $0.04 per share impact from asset impairments. All in all, the results were in line with our expectations given the margin environment we experienced during the quarter. ","I\u2019ll now go through more detailed view of developments since the fourth quarter, starting first with the Upstream. Average crude oil prices were lower in the fourth quarter with Brent down $4.56 and WTI down $4.22. However, despite the decline in crude markers, ExxonMobil\u2019s liquids realizations increased by $2.32 driven by improved Western Canadian differentials. ","Gas realizations on the other hand were down in the first quarter consistent with crude-linked LNG pricing lag and a $0.50 decline in Henry Hub pricing. Production in the Permian averaged 226,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 19% relative to the fourth quarter and more than double the average production we saw in the first quarter of last year. ","Exploration success continued Offshore Guyana with three additional discoveries since the beginning of the year. In February, we announced discoveries at the Tilapia and Haimara wells and the Yellowtail well, which we announced last week marked our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block. These discoveries add to the previously announced estimated recoverable resource of approximately 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels. ","We also discovered a major natural gas reservoir with the Glaucus well in Cyprus. Made the final investment decision to proceed with development of the Golden Pass LNG export project and made significant progress on another key project in our LNG portfolio which is signing of a gas agreement with the PNG government to support the Papua LNG expansion. ","In the Downstream, industry refining margins weakened due primarily to excess gasoline supply. As I mentioned, North American differentials narrowed in the first quarter, increased takeaway capacity in the Permian, and production curtailments in Western Canada.","From an operational standpoint, we successfully completed a heavy slate and scheduled maintenance impart to prepare for the upcoming IMO 2020 sulfur spec change. We announced final investment decisions for the Singapore resid upgrade projects, Fawley hydrofiner and the light crude expansion projects in Beaumont. ","These advanced investments will increase our capacity to produce higher value products including ultra-low sulfur fuels and Group II Premium lubricant base stock. ","Although fundamentals remains strong in the Chemical business, margins were challenged during the first quarter the supply lengths from recent industry capacity additions pressuring realizations. Supported by continued demand growth, our volumes in the Chemical business increased our 100,000 tons. ","We also progressed a polyethylene expansion at Beaumont, which is on track to start up in the third quarter and we funded three major Olefin derivative projects from U.S. Gulf Coast. ","Moving to Slide 5 for an overview of Upstream volumes. Production in the first quarter of 2019 was $4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with the production in the fourth quarter of last year. Again production in the Permian increased by 36,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 19% increase bringing total production in the Permian to 226,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the first quarter. ","This impressive growth is more than offset by lower Kearl output and natural field declines. Looking at first quarter production relative to the same periods last year shown on the bottom-left chart, liquids volumes increased 5%, growth of a 126,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian drove volumes higher. The absence of the PNG earthquake and lower maintenance in Canada and Qatar also contributed to an increase in volumes. ","Normal weather in Europe led to lower seasonal gas demand, but again, overall volumes were higher by more than 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter of the last year. ","Moving to Slide 6, and a review of first quarter results compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. First quarter earnings of $2.4 billion were down $3.7 billion. Upstream earnings were down approximately $400 million driven by the impact of fewer sales days in the quarter, higher maintenance and downtime notably at Golden and the absence of various one-time items that impacted our fourth quarter results. ","Downstream earnings decreased by $3 billion with several factors contributing to the lower results. Narrowed North American differentials, lower industry margins, the absence of fourth quarter asset sales in Germany and Italy, and derivative impacts. And I\u2019ll provide more details on these drivers on the upcoming slides. ","Finally, Chemical earnings were lower by $200 million, primarily driven by the absence of the favorable non-U.S. tax items in the fourth quarter and Chemical margins remained under pressure with recent industry capacity additions. ","Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019ll expand on the business drivers that impacted our Downstream\u2019s results, again relative to the fourth quarter. Downstream results for the first quarter were a loss of $256 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the absence of the Germany retail, and Augusta refinery asset sales and unfavorable margin impacts of approximately $2 billion. ","These unfavorable margin impacts are in line with the drivers that we\u2019ve previously communicated. The largest impact due to narrowing crude differentials again mainly in Western Canada that resulted in about half of the unfavorable margin impacts. ","In addition, industry refining margins were lower driven by excess gasoline supply and a tightened clean-dirty product spread. ","Finally, the absence of favorable mark-to-market derivative impacts in the fourth quarter which were the result of a declining oil price environment, combined with the unfavorable impacts in the first quarter has resulted in rising oil price environment resulted in a negative book margin impact of more than $600 million quarter-on-quarter. ","On Slide 8, I will provide a more detailed view of the current margin environment in the Downstream. The chart on the left of the page plot industry refining margins over time and clearly shows that the industry is inherently volatile. ","In the first quarter, industry refining margins were among the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the last ten years. Low conversion margins were relatively strong supported by fuel oil and distillate. However, high conversion margins were challenged. Weak gasoline, naphtha and LPG crack spreads. High refinery utilization drove oversupply of these products. ","Slide 9 provides some additional perspectives on the current Chemical margin environment. Again the chart on the upper left there shows the amount of polyethylene capacity added by years since 2009 compared to the annual growth in demand over that same period. ","Chemical demand remains strong and is expected to grow at approximately 3% per year, a 1.2 times global GDP. However, recent capacity additions have outpaced demand, depressing global PE margins as shown on the bottom-left chart. On the U.S. Gulf Coast alone, the industry has added nearly 5 million tons of capacity since 2017 in great part to capture the advantage of low-cost ethane feedstock. ","As a result, polyethylene margins have declined by approximately 45% since 2015 reflecting the cyclical nature of the Chemical business. ","Moving to Slide 10, which provides a review of our cash profile for the first quarter. First quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $8.3 billion in cash flows from operating activities. ","We experienced a $13 billion working capital release during the quarter. This was mostly offset \u2013 I am sorry \u2013 mostly due to higher seasonal payables balances which are primarily tax-related and an inventory release in the Downstream. This occurred as we do product inventories built higher to planned maintenance turnaround. ","Other non-cash items had a negative impact of approximately $1 billion, which most notably included the reinvestment of equity company earnings as part of the Tengiz expansion projects. First quarter additions to PP&E were $5.9 billion driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian Basin. ","Total capital expenditures were $6.9 billion, in line with the 2019 CapEx guidance that we provided at the Investor Day in March. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.87 per share, representing a 6% increase from last quarter and marking our 37th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. ","Gross debt increased by approximately $3 billion in the quarter and cash ended the quarter at $4.6 billion. ","Now, before I turn it over to Jack, let me provide a few observations regarding the second quarter. In the Upstream, we expect lower gas volumes driven by seasonal demand and I\u2019ll provide a little more detail on this on the next slide. In the Downstream, we expect industry refining margins to recover with higher seasonal gasoline demand and heavier industry maintenance, which is common this time of the year. ","North American crude differentials however are anticipated to remain near first quarter of 2019 levels. Scheduled maintenance in the second quarter in the Downstream will be similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in the first quarter. Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure as the market continues to work through supply lengths from recent capacity additions. ","And like the Downstream, scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the second quarter will be significant. And I\u2019ll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance in a few slides. But first, let me provide some more detail on seasonal gas demand on Slide 12. ","The chart on the left there shows the negative impacts we typically experienced from lower gas demand in Europe in the second quarter. And as you know, gas demand is highly seasonal and driven by weather. Second quarter gas demand is on average 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day lower than the first quarter of the year and we expect a similar trend to occur this year. ","Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some perspectives on our second quarter outlook for Downstream and Chemical\u2019s scheduled maintenance. As we previously communicated, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream in 2019 will be higher than normal and again partly in preparation for IMO 2020. ","We expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the second quarter to be broadly in line with what we experienced in the first quarter. ","The estimated earnings impacts for the second quarter for the Downstream is shown on the upper-left chart. In the Chemical business, again shown on the bottom-left chart, and as I indicated, we expect to see significant scheduled maintenance with the impact in the second quarter similar to the amount we saw in the entire second half of 2018. ","Hopefully that provides you with some helpful perspectives on key drivers of our expected performance for the upcoming second quarter. At this time, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Jack. ","Jack Williams","Okay, thank you, Neil. Well, as Neil covered, it was a tough market environment for us this quarter. Overall though, we are pleased with the underlying operating performance of the businesses and of course wish that margin environment would have supported the translation of that into higher earnings. ","But as you saw in the Downstream margin plot that Neil showed, the margins were at historically low levels and our results were in line with that margins earned. The plot also demonstrated the historical volatility of Downstream margins and the wide swing that happen over a pretty short period of time, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t try to predict or forecast margins. ","Instead, we work to build our businesses to be robust to the swings and while we test new investments across a broad range of prices. ","Investments we are currently pursuing across all three sectors stand up to that testing and our advantage versus industry. So that\u2019s going to help us manage through this volatility and it\u2019s going to deliver value in markets that remains fundamentally strong. ","Our activities to execute those new investments remain on track and some significant progress so far this year that Neil has mentioned, I\u2019ll just reiterate, the Upstream we doubled Permian production volumes in the first quarter of last year and made three new discoveries in Guyana. I feel really good about the strong portfolio of Upstream investments that we have today which are at the top tier of industry. ","And as you know, a strong opportunity pipeline is critical given the depletion nature of the Upstream business. In the Downstream, we FID three major refining projects and the other three of the six projects that I have been talking about are now online. These investments improved the yield profile as strategically important sites delivering higher value products that are growing in demand. ","In the Chemicals, we also funded three projects, three major U.S. Gulf Coast olefin derivative projects and are making good progress with the Corpus steam cracker which we expect to FID around mid-year of this year and when we do that, that will be our 12th FID of the 13 investments that underpin the Chemical\u2019s growth plan and allow us to maintain a strong position in our performance product markets.","And finally, we are continuing to see value from our integrated business model and we are really pleased that our new Upstream and projects organizations are now up and running. ","So, with that, let me provide a few activity highlights starting with the Permian. As you can see on the left-hand graph, we are continuing to track our production outlook. This volumes ramp is supported by strong well inventory. In fact, by the time we reach 1 million barrels a day production level in the Permian, we will have only drilled about half of our current well inventory. ","We are running 46 rigs there and we\u2019ll be ramping up through the year. And this level of rig activity allows us to develop multiple horizons and either full or half sections concurrently which reduces the risk apparent well performance issues as wells with possible communications will be fracked before any are produced. The development with this method requires blocky acreage and a large rig fleet and a long-term commitment to deal with lumpier production profiles and we have all three. ","In addition to this drilling activity, we are building out our unique infrastructure in the Delaware with the first stage facility that\u2019s a central delivery point in our Southeast and Mexico acreage being ready by year end. So, good progress in the Permian and also in Guyana. ","Last week, we announced a new discovery in the Yellowtail-1 well which as Neil said it was our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block. And you can see in the map on the left that this discovery is in the Turbot area which is going to be a large development of similar to Liza. ","This well along with Haimara and Tilapia discoveries are going to add to the 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels recoverable resource estimate that we announced earlier this year at our Investor Day. ","And our drilling continues. Development drilling at 17 wells for producing the first phase of Liza is progressing well and should be completed in the third quarter. The other rigs will continue drilling exploration in appraisal wells including further drilling on the Hammerhead and Ranger discoveries. ","The construction of the Liza Destiny FPSO vessel for phase one is being completed in Singapore with planned sail-away this summer and should be in Guyanese waters in the third quarter. The larger Liza Phase 2 development designed to produced 220,000 barrels a day is in the permitting phase and is planned for a 2022 start-up. So, lots of activity, exciting new discovery, really good development progress in Guyana. ","Let me switch gears and talk about few Downstream project updates. Starting in Singapore, I\u2019ve spoken about the Singapore resid project before and is now been FID. This project is upgrading resid to higher quality distillates and Group II lube base stocks which will be unique in industry. No one has ever upgraded heavy fuel oil streams into Group II lube base stocks. ","This project is taking a notional $60 per barrel product and upgrading into a $140 per barrel product. It\u2019s an industry first and it\u2019s made possible through proprietary process and catalyst technology. It\u2019s the largest of the six major refining projects that we have and due to its technology advantage, it is expected to generate a high-teens return. ","And this project is really a great example of several competitive advantages that we spoke about last March or at the back in March. It\u2019s made possible by a new unique technology. We filed for 35 patents related to the catalyst and novel processes that will be used and it\u2019s a very large project. It\u2019s upgrading 90,000 barrels a day of fuel oil, which really moves the needle on site profitability. ","So clearly, this project is leveraging our scale. And it\u2019s a terrific example of integration. And Singapore \u2013 Singapore is our largest integrated site globally and with this project, we are upgrading both refinery and chemical resid streams with two different but complementary technology solutions. ","In fact, I mentioned this is a downstream project. But you ought to think about this as an integrated downstream and Chemical project. It significantly improves the competitive to the Singapore refinery and reduces the supply cost of our crude cracker below any other liquids cracker in Asia. So that\u2019s planned for 2023.","So now let me talk about a project we haven\u2019t talked much about and that\u2019s Fawley. Our project at Fawley is the last of the six key refining projects that are introduced to you back in 2018 and it\u2019s also now fully funded. ","This project is more straightforward than Singapore. It leverages advantage logistics and like our Rotterdam and Antwerp projects, it\u2019s tightly integrated with the Northwest Europe Refining and Chemical circuit. ","It improves our refining profitability in two important ways. First, it upgrades the product slate to better match the UK market. The more ultra low sulfur diesel, more jet fuel, more lower sulfur mogas which reduces both imports and exports in the site. ","And second, the project expands Fawley\u2019s logistics into the heart of the UK market allowing for increased product flow into our West London Terminal, which services nearby Heathrow Airport. With the combination of these two aspects will make Fawley the most efficient and most competitive fuel supply into the Greater London market. And this combination also translates into an expected project return in the high-teens. ","So, again, switching gears beyond projects, another activity we\u2019ve been focused on is the optimization of our entire value chain, both in lubricants and in fuels. We continue to get some questions on our trading activities. ","So, I thought I\u2019d add some context \u2013 since it was a reconciling earnings factor this quarter. On the left is a summary of our global footprint from equity production to refining capacity to logistics, to our branded retail sites. ","Our assets stay in the globe and the entire value chain. Our objective is to ensure our shareholders capture the full value of that chain from the reservoir to the gas tank, and of our footprint from U.S. to Europe to Asia. Then no matter where the value is realized along the chain or around the world. So we are using asset-backed trading to best achieve that objective without speculating. ","For example, posing low gas arms from Europe to the Americas or providing storage of our products \u2013 for products when logistics temporarily tighten. We are basically improving the utilization of our global assets and generating solid value from these activities. Although sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see quarter-on-quarter, due to changing mark-to-market impact from our open derivative positions which was certainly the case this quarter. ","So to wrap up, we are continuing to leverage our competitive advantages of scale, technology, integration, functional excellence and of course, our high quality workforce to grow shareholder value. We have made good progress towards our growth plan so far this year with further exploration success and project FIDs. ","We remain focused on continuously improving our base business while making investments across the value chain to grow earnings and cash flow across a broad range of price and margin environments. And finally, as evidenced by the additional exploration success in Guyana, we continue to be reminded that there is still a good bit of upside with this exciting growth plan that our company is on. ","So with that, let me hand it back to Neil to kick-off our Q&A session. ","Neil Hansen","Right. Thank you for your comments, Jack. We will now be more than happy to take any questions you have. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you Mr. Williams and Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] We will first go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. ","Sam Margolin ","Good morning guys. How are you doing? ","Neil Hansen","Good morning. ","Jack Williams","Great, Sam. Good morning.","Sam Margolin ","So, my first question is about the Permian. Your program there is complex in a lot of ways, but one specific element of it is that if you look at the capital that you are spending there today, there is sort of a split between what\u2019s kind of pre-productive in facilities and delineation and what\u2019s part of the development program. ","Can you just broadly tell us where you are at right now in that mix? And maybe, how that\u2019s going to evolve until your 2021 inflection when the pipeline comes on and it looks like you sort of go hyperbolic on the production side?","Jack Williams","Yes, thanks, Sam. Look, it\u2019s a good question and I will \u2013 I appreciate you acknowledging all the things we are doing in the Permian right now. We talk a lot about the rig counts. That\u2019s kind of the headline number how many rigs are you running which is important and it\u2019s obviously directly resulting in the volumes growth that we talked about. ","But we are also doing a lot more. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve been working very hard to delineate this new acreage we have in this basin which we\u2019ve made some good progress on. And lining up this big kind of differentiated project that we are looking to do there and that infrastructure that I talked that we are setting up. ","That central delivery point and one of the units in our new development will be designed for 100,000 barrels of crude and 200 million cubic feet of gas and it\u2019s set up to keep expanding that as our production grows. So we\u2019ve seen a good bit of time spending a lot of time and energy and resources on setting ourselves up for long-term success in the Permian and not just the near-term volumes growth. ","It\u2019s hard for me to give you a percentage break between those two activities. But I will tell you that the infrastructure piece of it is pretty material. ","Sam Margolin ","Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then, somebody is going to ask this, so am as well, be me. Just on your position there today, it looks like there is going to be some consolidation at least chatter around for a while. ","Just to clarify all your forecast that you put up publicly that\u2019s based on what you\u2019ve got in the portfolio today, there is not necessarily any additional A&D activity that\u2019s baked into that. Is that correct? And it\u2019s hard for you. What do you see in the landscape of maybe private and public that\u2019s available to you right now?","Jack Williams","Yes, thanks, Sam. Yes, you are probably right. Somebody is going to ask that question. Look, I mean, clearly, that\u2019s why I wanted to mention the well inventories in my remarks. What we have today is clearly only dependent on what we have in our resource estimate and well inventory today. It\u2019s not depending on any additional acquisitions, not depending on any technology improvements, any continued efficiency improvements in our well designs. ","All of which I think will happen, but it\u2019s not baked into any outlooks we have right now. In terms of \u2013 I think let me just step back and look at the whole M&A environment and just make the comment that I think it\u2019s a reminder of the statement I made about the upstream being a depletion business. You have to have a good pipeline of investment opportunities to continue to replenish as you deplete those resources and that was very much on our mind back in 2015 and 2016. ","We are very active in the bottom of the cycle to bring on this nice set of new opportunities we have that we are currently executing today. Some of those were acquisitions. It was partly organic, partly small company acquisitions, but all picked up at the bottom of the market and they made good sense back in that kind of \u2013 I\u2019ll call it, $40 to $50 environment that you can imagine in kind of $60, $70 environment that looked that much better. ","So very happy with what we take up and it gives us the luxury to sit here today and to not need to do any further M&A activity. Not to say we won\u2019t but we don\u2019t need to. So, for instance, I would be surprised if over time, we did not take up the more Permian acreage. But I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s going to be small bolt-on acquisitions that we pick up over time. ","I don\u2019t know what the timing in which that\u2019s going to happen or whether it\u2019s something more significant. But we don\u2019t need to. We don\u2019t need to, so we have the luxury of being able to look over the horizon and make sure that whatever we look hard at, is bringing significant value and makes really good sense and it\u2019s very compelling for the corporation. ","Sam Margolin ","Thanks so much.","Neil Hansen","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. ","Roger Read ","Yes, good morning. I guess, maybe we could take a look at Guyana, three discoveries year-to-date, I mean, if you did want a year, it would be a pretty good track record. This was definitely a focus of the Analyst Day and you\u2019ve continued to have discoveries. You mentioned the resources above 5.5 billion barrels most likely with these additional discoveries. ","Jack, when do you think Exxon considers maybe more than just what\u2019s been laid out? Maybe what\u2019s the timing for when you are thinking about that internally, maybe when that gets addressed at the public level? And then, what that can mean in terms of additional developments beyond the five FPSOs that have been discussed?","Jack Williams","Well, thanks for the question, and yes, I mean, Guyana, it's a really exciting time for us there right now, a lot of activity and we are incorporating to the extent we can, we are incorporating that data real-time as we get more developments in, more discoveries, but as we get these discoveries, we naturally want to drill some delineation wells, get some more data, core - get some dynamic well test data. ","So we are incorporating and by the way, on all of these development wells, we are drilling for Liza-1, these 17 wells, every single time we are penetrating reservoir, we are getting more opportunities to the tune up our seismic data and improve our sub-service understanding. So we are learning significant amounts kind of day-by-day in Guyana. ","I think I would just say that, again, the 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels recoverable resource estimate did not include these last three discoveries. So I would say, it's safe to say there is a good bit of upside to that number. ","I can't really give you anything further right now in terms of quantifying that, but we are continuing to look at that development plan and looking what would be the best way to continue to incorporate this additional encouraging results that we are getting.","Roger Read ","Okay. And along those lines, I guess, maybe the seismic shoot that's currently, I can't remember it's currently under way or it's about to be underway, but I guess you'd want to get all that information and then that analysis done before you'd really kind of make any major change, I would guess?","Jack Williams","Yes, I think, again, clearly, as I said, our sub-service understanding is really growing and that's going to further add to it. So, the more we can get as we are planning these new developments, the better, the more efficient we can plan them. So, yes, that's another piece of data that's going to be important.","Roger Read ","And then if I could pivot real quick to the Chemicals business, the chart on the capacity additions in the margin is definitely very helpful. I mean, Jack, you've got a lot of experience in that in the Downstream Chemicals area. ","What would be kind of the typical workout process here as you think about what's coming on globally and the demand expectations, the 3.3% a year? Need help for when we kind of get back to maybe a more, call it, normalized margin environment or at least one we are not facing headwinds in terms of the direction of margins?","Jack Williams","Well, the demand growth is, call it, 4 MTA \u2013 3 MTA to 4 MTA a year global demand growth and we brought on 5 MTA to 6 MTA. So it's going to take \u2013 it's not months, not months. But it's not a - more than a handful of years either. So I am thinking, things \u2013 I would think certainly depending on what more comes on in 2020, we start \u2013 not start seeing relief then. ","But the rest of 2019 might be pretty tough, but we are not going to, not trying to predict where margins going to go, there is all kinds of other factors that come into play but - and there is good reason. We understand why the oversupply happened. This ethane advantage in the U.S. is very real. But, as you think about our investments going forward, I'll take for instance the Corpus cracker that I referenced. ","We are testing that over the whole resiliency of \u2013 we are testing the resiliency out of the whole range of the cycle and in that particular project, we have tested that the current environment we see today is within the band of what we are testing on that project and remains robust. ","So all we can do is continue to make the best investments in the industry, which we are doing and I think that'll be worked off in a relatively short time, but I don't think it's going to be in the coming couple of months.","Roger Read ","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta ","Jack, Neil, thanks for taking the question. The first is just on the asset sale program. You guys introduced a relatively robust asset sale target earlier this year. Can you give us an update on the program? And just frame for us again how we should think about that target? Is it really a P50 type of target? Or did you bake in a level of conservatism given the uncertainty around the macro?","Jack Williams","Yes, thanks for the question. It's an important topic for us these days. Naturally, as I mentioned, with bringing in all of these attractive assets and investment opportunities, it's a really good opportunity to go back and look at the portfolio kind of prune the tail a bit, if you will. ","And so, we work just \u2013 we looked at the whole portfolio and had this plan that we laid out and you can imagine that as we give you all our number that we haven't done before, we feel fairly confident in it. So, it\u2019s \u2013 there is some risking in there. We could overshoot that a bit. ","But we feel like that's a good number. I'll call it P50, maybe a tad more conservative than P50. But I'll call it that as we go forward, and we are making good progress. And then we have lots of activity in the market right now. And I would expect to see some significant divestments this calendar year as we move toward this three year plan.","Neil Mehta ","And could you remind us, Jack, what the regions are? I know you called out Gulf of Mexico, that's on the market right now.","Jack Williams","No, it's global, I'll just tell you that. I mean, it's not just a U.S. focused divestment plan. It kind of spans the \u2013 it spans all regions. So, it's pretty broad. I don't have the specific breakout on regions, but it's broad.","Neil Mehta ","Fair enough. Thank you. And then the follow-up is on, going back to your comments on the M&A market, can you just give us the framework again for the way you think about acquiring incremental assets, whether acquiring companies, what's Exxon looking for here? ","And the context is that the bid \u2013 I want to get some perspective on one, the bid-ask and two, the relative valuation multiple of Exxon based on consensus cash flow numbers relative to potential acquisition targets has increased over the course of the last six months. And so, from an accretion perspective, it does seem more compelling at least on in a spreadsheet. ","But I just want a little bit more color on the framework and just thoughts on the opportunity set to build on your prior comments.","Jack Williams","Yes, okay. Good. Thanks. Let me provide a little more on how we are thinking about M&A. In terms of what we are looking for, clearly we want to \u2013 if you think about what we've brought in recently with our acquisition in Papua New Guinea, acquisition and Mozambique, acquisition in the Permian, these are all assets where we can add significant value. ","They are going to leverage our competitive strengths, allow us to bring a lot of value to that asset and a lot more value than what we \u2013 than the acquisition costs. So, we are not really interested in buying well-developed assets that are more or less buying cash flow. We are interested in buying something where we can bring our competitive strengths and to bear on uplifting the value of that asset. ","And I think, that's been very clear in terms of what we brought into portfolio in that method. And so, one thing to think about that we also think about especially these days is that, we have a full plate of opportunities right now. So, one thing we are doing is, we just talked about the investments we are kind of making, we are moving stuff off the plate to make sure we have plenty of room to continue to develop these great assets that we have. ","But clearly, as we think about incremental opportunities, we are thinking about substitution. We are not thinking about additive, because we are \u2013 the organization has plenty to work on right now and we are cognizant of that fact and that ultimately be the limiting factor in terms of what we are trying to do. So, we kind of factor all that in. ","But one thing I can tell you for sure is that any acquisition opportunity we look at would be something we think we can bring a lot of additional value to.","Neil Mehta ","Appreciated, Jack. Thanks, Neil.","Neil Hansen ","Thank you, Neil.","Jack Williams","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.","Biraj Borkhataria ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on Neil's question, on the future projects and new additions to the portfolio, are you basically saying that the project\u2019s organizational capacity is in limit at the moment, because obviously the balance sheet is very strong you could do more if you wanted to. ","But there is probably a level of efficiency with how many major projects you want to do at the same time? That will be my first question. And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up to that.","Jack Williams","Yes. What I would tell you is it's a big consideration. I am not saying we necessarily at our limit, but I am saying it's a big consideration, because it's key to capital efficiency. The industry is littered with projects that look really good at FID and were not executed well. And ended up not providing the value that they should have. ","We are committed to making sure that what we take on we can execute well and as we bring something else in the portfolio, we are going to make that test. We are going to test to make sure that we can \u2013 whatever we bring in, we can execute it well. And so, the ones we funded, we are going to get the value out of our shareholders. ","So, I wouldn't tell you necessarily we are at some limit, but we are looking at it closely. And it's a strong consideration as we bring new opportunities on.","Operator","Okay. Moving on, we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate ","Excuse me. Thank you. You took me by surprise there. Good morning everybody.","Neil Hansen ","Good morning, Doug.","Jack Williams","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate ","Guys, I guess, this is an opening comment. I guess, a lot of people maybe didn't pay enough attention to your 8-K in terms of the numbers that you tried to walk back early in April and my suggestion to you is, perhaps a press release around that detail might be a better way of getting that out there, because it seems to me that there were still a lot of steel numbers in your earnings. Just an opening comment if you can indulge me. My two questions \u2013 yes, go ahead.","Jack Williams","Can I go ahead now at your opening comment, because I think you are right. I mean, we certainly \u2013 we endeavor it in a fairly concerted effort to provide appropriate perspectives on what we were seeing in the quarter and I think during the call in the fourth quarter, we kind of listed out some of those factors and then, as you mentioned, we also provided additional couple of 8-Ks during the quarter to help people understand, especially in the Downstream and Chemical business, some of the challenges we were facing. ","And again, from our perspective, there were no surprises in the results. I think the results that we are communicating today are exactly in line with what we provided in those 8-Ks. And again, during the quarter, in the fourth quarter. So we appreciate that, and maybe we are continuing to look at ways to improve providing that transparency making sure that we provide the context to the market.","Doug Leggate ","Yes, terrific effort on that point. No question. The disclosure has gotten a lot better, for what is worth you have my number. So we are quite happy. Anyway, I got two questions if I may. My first one, Jack, disposals were very light on this quarter. ","I just wonder, if you could speak to, why that might be your expectation if that was timing-related and your confidence level as if whether you still expect to hit the kind of runrate laid out in March? And then my follow-up, I'll wait till you answer that my follow-up is on the Guyana, please. Thank you.","Jack Williams","Yes. Sure, Doug. Yes, you're right, very light in this quarter, fully expected by us, the timeframe on these. Generally, we are starting a year ahead of time in terms of getting these things in the market when the being able to get something to the point where we can announce it. So, fully expected and does not alter my confidence one bit in terms of our target going forward. Lot of activity right now and like I said, I'd expect more this year.","Doug Leggate ","Thanks. We will look forward to that. My follow-up is kind of a part A and a part B, if you've been named on Guyana, as we just come back from Singapore, I visited the Liza Destiny and I guess, sort of a couple of points around this. ","SPM are telling us a number of - what I think are incremental data points for us, at least. First of all, they expect to sail mid-June which would put you in Guyana run by early August. So I am just wondering \u2013 or mid-August, what that means for the timing of phase 1? That's my first question.","Second question is they are also telling as you've confirmed to them Payara will be 220,000 barrels a day. So, wonder if you can speak to that? And then finally, two appraisal wells in Hammerhead, both your exploration assets dedicated to \u2013 on appraisal. That seems to me, you wouldn't do that unless you were planning a fast track FID, which obviously got implications for your volume targets. So, I wonder if you could speak to that and I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Jack Williams","Okay. Thanks. Thank you, Doug. On the FASO, the Liza Destiny, look, what you mentioned was consistent with what I said earlier in terms of a summer sail-away in the third quarter being in Guyanese waters. We set our start-up as was early first quarter of 2020 and we always are trying to do better. ","So if we can get that thing online before then, we will. And I would just say the project is going very well, very well. We are pleased in both the FPSO construction activity and also the drilling activity going on in the country. So everything is just a bright green light on that and we'll see where we end up in terms of actual start-up.","On Payara, again, I would just say that that the number you threw out wasn't within the range we've been talking about. I really don't have any update today in terms of where that's specifically going to be. But that's not really inconsistent with what we've been talking about, just to kind of on the high-end. And then on Hammerhead, look, I would just say, Doug, it's still early days, we are still doing a lot of delineation drilling. We are still a lot to learn. ","In Guyana, we have multiple play types. We have multiple parts to the stratigraphic section. It's a huge block. We are continuing to learn. I wouldn't draw too much into where we are going in terms of delineation activities. We are still just trying to gather a lot of data. I would just tell you that, in general, the vector is very positive. But I wouldn't get more specific than that.","Doug Leggate ","Well, I appreciate you taking part A, B and C. Thanks a lot, Jack. Thanks, Neil.","Jack Williams","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh ","Hi. Good morning. I guess, just a follow-up on Doug's original comments. Maybe some clarifications to help us, perhaps trying to avoid something in the second quarter. Two parts to it. One is, the derivatives impact that you are talking about quarter-over-quarter of $600 million. ","If we go back to a more neutral, flattish price environment, your comments obviously are clear they are not adding back a full $600 million. But I am just trying to understand order of magnitude, how to think about that. ","And then, secondarily, on the cash flow side, you talked about the affiliates elements there, some of which was Tengiz. I believe, which according to Chevron's slides are expected to continue. But also I remember last year's first quarter that there were some seasonal elements to this where it was a big headwind in the first quarter last year as well. So, if you could clarify both of those items moving forward, that will be helpful.","Neil Hansen ","Sure. Phil, I can take that. So on the derivatives, so the impact we saw in the first quarter. We talked about the mark-to-market. It was a combination of a gain that we saw on the unsettled positions we had during the fourth quarter in a price environment that was declining. Again that was roughly $300 million, $400 million on the mark-to-market. ","And then, when you look at the first quarter, again, we had a derivative activity on the unsettled positions there with rising oil prices, we saw a negative or an unfavorable mark-to-market on those positions. And so, it's really, when you look at a relative comparison, that's where we see the $600 million impact on the earnings. ","Going forward, it's not an easy thing to predict. It obviously depends on what happens in the price environment. I can tell you that, again, generally what will happen is if oil prices rise, we are likely to see unfavorable impacts on those mark-to-market positions. And then, if prices decline, we are likely to see a gain. ","I think, if you looked at the quarterly, the absolute quarterly effects last year, it was a couple hundred million dollars per quarter. Again, sometimes it was negative, sometimes it was positive. But hopefully that gives you some indication of the level of activity. And as Jack mentioned, we are increasing the amount of asset-backed trading that we are doing. ","So that might increase the impact you see in a quarter. But again, we are not taking speculative positions. This is based on our assets. And so you are not likely to see a significant increase. But again, hopefully that gives you some perspective, Phil, on what to expect going forward.","On your second question on the cash, so, in the first quarter we did see, I think, we mentioned, there is always going to be some timing on the equity companies, difference between when earnings occur and when we get those dividends. There is always going to be an impact on that. And in the first quarter, we do typically see a bit higher increase in that area. ","When it comes to the timing when that comes back, if you look at the biggest impact there is on Tengiz, our equity investment in Tengiz. And so, as you know, they're undertaking a significant expansion. And so a lot of those earnings are being reinvested back into that expansion. We are still getting some dividends from them. ","But a lot of that is going to be delayed until they have completed that expansion. And in the first quarter, that was roughly about $400 million, that timing difference between earnings and dividends. But for the rest of it, again, we see a little bit of a headwind in the first quarter. That's likely to work itself off during the year. The one specific item where it might be longer than that is the TCO investment in Tengiz.","Phil Gresh ","And just to clarify, the Tengiz part of that, is that included in the co-land or is that separate?","Neil Hansen ","I think the co-land is separate. This is just an effect of them taking the earnings and then reinvesting them back into that expansion.","Phil Gresh ","Got it. Okay. Last question would just be for Jack. On the Downstream side of things, maybe you could just give us your latest thoughts here. Obviously, the first quarter is challenging. The cracks element is getting better as we progress through the year. ","But where would you put yourself about how optimistic you are around IMO 2020? The impact we could see from that. And when we might see it? Valero was saying that maybe September, October you start to see some impacts on crack spreads from it. But curious how you think about things in light of all the diesel upgrading investments you've been making.","Jack Williams","Yes. Thanks. The - in terms of the overall margins, you saw the vector of the graph that we showed, that Neil showed, going up quite a bit in March and further up a bit in April. So, I would say things are restoring to, what I would call, more typical levels in terms of overall industry refining margins. So don't know how much further I can really project that out. ","But in terms of margin we are seeing right now, certainly, clearly different than the average of the first quarter. And in terms of the IMO, I think that the timeframe you talked about is a pretty good estimate, that's kind of what my guys were telling me too, that kind of late third quarter, early fourth quarter is when the market is going to be adjusting to that January 1st spec change. So, we ought to start seeing something in that sort of timeframe.","All I can tell you is that, the market fundamentals would say that the clean\/dirty spread needs to expand and grow. Don't know how much that's going to grow. Don't know how long it's going to stay there. Obviously, one of the things that was interesting in the first quarter, it actually contracted. ","The clean\/dirty spread actually contracted, because of all the conversion capacity that's been added just kind of destroying demand for fuel oil, so. Hard to predict. The fundamentals would say. Yes, but it clearly needs to go out and of course that's going to help all the high conversion refineries, which we have many. ","So, I am kind of \u2013 we are looking forward to that time period. But it's really, really hard to tell the exact numbers on how big that's going to get and like I said, how long it's going to last.","Phil Gresh ","Thanks for the comment.","Neil Hansen ","Thanks, Phil.","Jack Williams","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS.","Jon Rigby ","Thank you. Hi, Jack. I just wanted to return to the Downstream. And to echo the comments, appreciate the pre-close guidance and the detail on it and granularity. But it does strike me it's the sort of second-quarter in a rolling year where the Downstream in total has had a difficult quarter. It shares some of those with peers. ","But it does look to me that ExxonMobil has become quite volatile in the way it delivers its Downstream earnings both refining market and Chemicals. And that's somewhat different to what we've experienced historically. So, I just wanted to sort of explore that a little bit more and ask you, is that just a function of some idiosyncratic characteristics of the market right now? ","Is that to do with some changes that are going on at ExxonMobil itself? Or is it just that it's to do largely with the preparation ahead of IMO in the sort of the downtime that you are having to experience? It just looks that a lot of kilter would what we've seen over many years. Thanks.","Jack Williams","Yes, Jon. First of all, fourth quarter was actually very strong for the Downstream.","Jon Rigby ","Yes.","Jack Williams","The market environment was better, but not a lot better, but what was different was we had those differentials in North America. And they helped us in the fourth quarter and of course that's not just \u2013 it's not just something that just came out of thin air. We made investments in the Midstream to be able to where we are seeing across the value chain. ","In some quarters, that's going to help us a lot more than other quarters. So in other words, where there is market disconnect, we are going to be in an advantage position. So, fourth quarter and first quarter was a big difference. As Neil said, some of that was mark-to-market impacts, which that maybe something that may be a little different than what we saw historically. ","The Midstream exposure, we feel really good about that we think it's adding a lot of value for our shareholders. That might provide a little more fluctuations. But other than that, I don't see it and I feel very strongly that both of those activities are adding material value over the mid-term and long-term. So feel really good about what we are doing there.","Jon Rigby ","Right. And just\u2026 ","Jack Williams","In terms of -- again, in terms of IMO, we have very high conversion, we are adding to that conversions. Everything we are doing on these refining projects is adding advantaged products, products that are growing in demand and feel really good. We are making our refineries more competitive as we go forward. All of them are moving to lower cost to supply, more competitive in the global refining spectrum.","Jon Rigby ","Right. So, would it be fair to say that the sort of measures that you're talking about extending your participation along the entire value chain at the same time just a lot of happened at the same time as some of the macro conditions have worked against you to show what the benefits of those initiatives are. Is that the way of thinking about it right now?","Jack Williams","Actually, Jon, I really wouldn't look at it that way, because I think we've benefited - net benefited. If you call that macro, it\u2019s only one particular quarter, Okay, maybe I would agree. If you look at it over just take a year, we've got \u2013 we've had net benefit from looking across the value chain. ","Clearly net benefit and our asset-backed trading activities clearly have benefits. So, I think the macro factors have played out pretty much as we expected and we are benefiting from what we are doing. You just got to expand your horizon beyond one quarter.","Jon Rigby ","Right, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. We'll next move to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason Gammel ","Thanks very much and good morning, gentlemen. ","Neil Hansen ","Good morning, Jason. ","Jack Williams","My first question \u2013 the first question I had was on some comments that you had made earlier, Jack, about essentially project capabilities. You obviously sanctioned Golden Pass during the first quarter. You made some pretty significant strides on PNG, LNG or at PNG as it relates to the Elk-Antelope fields during the quarter and also have made progress on Mozambique. ","You are essentially the operator for all three of these on the Downstream. Do you think the organization would have the capabilities by proceeding with all three at the same time?","Jack Williams","Yes. Yes, I do think we have those capabilities and that\u2019s - we've actually modeled it all out and we definitely have the capability to do that. And I would tell you one thing also that's helping us in that regard is our new projects organization. Combining all our project resources into one functional company, that's really going to allow us to capture a lot of synergies across executing those projects. ","You mentioned all those were upstream projects, but we have some big projects in Downstream and Chemicals as well. So it's one company. We are able to look across the entire project spectrum and make sure we are deploying the right resources on the right projects and they have looked at all of that activity and we feel confident in our ability to execute it. ","My point I was making earlier was, as we bring new things on, we are going to continue to reassess that. As we bring in new opportunities, which I fully expect we will, we are going to continue to test that statement. And it is a consideration as we continue to look at bringing new things in.","Jason Gammel ","Thanks for that clarification, Jack. Second question is completely unrelated. We've been looking at just some of the state data for well productivity in the Permian Basin. And your wells are essentially pretty close to best-in-class. I was just wondering if you could comment on any proprietary technology advantages that you feel that you have in the Permian or is this just a reflection of just better quality rock than others. Is it a combination of the two, any comments you might have?","Jack Williams","Yes, we've been \u2013 obviously, we are putting a lot of focus in the Permian right now. And I would say it's kind of a combination of all the above. I mentioned this more kind of cube development. You've heard \u2013 a bit talk about. It's pretty easy to talk about. It's pretty hard to execute it. And as I said, you got to be committed to kind of a lumpy production profile. ","But we are seeing some very positive results with that methodology. We've seen here from the guys that recently about a 16-well development in the Delaware Basin where we executed that with average well results, about 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 16 wells. So, I would say, the combination of the technology organization looking focusing on the Permian. ","The delineation results that are coming in positive. they're allowing us more confidence in terms of getting out there and doing these stacked developments, combined with just continuing to go up the learning curve and especially in the Delaware Basin. I think all kind of combining to starting to really hit our stride in the Permian.","Jason Gammel ","Appreciate that, Jack.","Operator","And next we'll go to Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy.","Blake Fernandez ","Guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, appreciate the color going into 2Q, and I think you flagged the European volumes. My question was more around the Canadian side of things with Kearl and government curtailments. Do you have any color on how to think about that kind of moving forward versus 1Q levels?","Jack Williams","I am sorry. Say that one more time.","Blake Fernandez ","So, the Canadian piece of the puzzle.","Jack Williams","Oh, yes.","Blake Fernandez ","I think there were some government curtailments in Kearl and I am just trying to understand how we should be thinking about volumes moving forward versus 1Q levels?","Jack Williams","Yes, the - we definitely had some production impacts from the curtailments, they weren't hugely significant relative to timing of downtime, unscheduled maintenance and so forth. But there was some impacts, some of the Kearl impact was not that. But we had some impact from Syncrude in that regard. And so overall, there was impact for Upstream for that curtailment activity. ","I would just kind of make the comment in general about the unintended consequences of that action, which is, there is some curtailment right now. There is production shut-in. And yet, there is spare rail capacity that's not being utilized to get barrels to market. So, clearly, that's not -- that was not an intended consequence and it's not \u2013 it's a market inefficiency right now that the markets having to work around. ","So, we hope that that's going to be improved going forward. We think the right market clearing mechanism is that we do have the rail, available rail working. And hope to get that point where it is and that will allow more production be flowing out of Western Canada.","Blake Fernandez ","Yes, totally agreed. Second question, Jack, you mentioned in the Permian, once you get up to a million barrels a day, that's going to be about half of your inventory. I am just trying to understand the thought process as you get to that and kind of move forward. ","I mean, at some point, it doesn't make sense to whipsaw up and down. Obviously, you want to keep infrastructure full, et cetera. So, is it kind of a view that once you hit that level, maybe sustaining production is kind of the right way to think about it?","Jack Williams","I would tell you that's more or less our current thought. We'll just continue testing that as we get more well results in and as I've said, if we get more bolt-on acreage and so forth, we may test that some further. But you are right, capital efficiency is really important for us. We are set up with this infrastructure to continue to expand those central delivery points. ","So, we are planned to have the flexibility to continue to move that plateau level. But that kind of reflects our current plan. The other thing that I'd tell you, I am absolutely confident technology is going to continue to improve. We are going to continue to get some upside in terms of EURs out there and that may also play into re-testing that plateau level. ","But, I would say right now, that's kind of our base case, that's our case to be.","Blake Fernandez ","Helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.","Jason Gabelman ","Hey, asked and answered. Thanks.","Neil Hansen ","All right. Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions?","Operator","It looks like there are no further questions at this time.","Neil Hansen ","Okay. Well, we appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight our first quarter that included solid operating performance in a challenging margin environment, continued success in Guyana, excellent progress in the Permian and final investment decisions on key Downstream and Chemical projects. ","We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.","Now turning to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. Exxon Mobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management. While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses.","Exxon Mobil completed six major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth.","Strong operating performance of the base portfolio along with these project efficients delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion, with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices.","Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the US, estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector. And Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tempered growth.","Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations.","Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. Corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $38.7 billion.","The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. Total for the quarter cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.","The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short-term borrowing by about $4 billion.","Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year ago quarter, though our Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. In the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next year to two years.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel and gas was down $2.76 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million.","Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts including US deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs.","Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14%, where ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partially offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes.","Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter, and natural gas prices were down $0.40 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects, and new project start-ups.","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts.","Turning to slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower US maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects.","Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects.","Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million while favorable volumes mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million, primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities.","Turning now to the full year financial results starting on slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. Corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares.","CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion.","Turning to slide 18, cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year.","Moving to slide 19, graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justify the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows along with our financial strength provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand.","Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Total dividends per share, $2.88, are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding.","During 2015, Exxon Mobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015.","So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming analyst meeting.","Moving now to slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results, 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs.","Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume mix effects increased earnings $810 million where contributions from major project startups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses.","Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices partially offset by asset high-grading, including the startup of new development projects.","Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlement impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production however was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the US along with higher entitlements.","Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects mainly driven by increased maintenance reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, while reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects.","On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains.","Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. Fixed major project startups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015.","In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next two years. We expect to start up six of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity.","Moving now to slide 26. We continued to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to Exxon Mobil's asset portfolio, while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history is nearly complete and we will begin appraising the Liza discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest in operatorship of the Canje block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres.","In the Romanian Black Sea, Exxon Mobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun block after successfully drilling seven consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies.","And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuqu\u00e9n province. Program consists of five wells along with construction of production facilities and a gas pipeline.","Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. Exxon Mobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres.","In Canada, we were awarded interests in three blocks offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-prone hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest in our currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres.","So I'd now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. Exxon Mobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results.","Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator.","Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce costs. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion.","Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. And we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming analyst meeting which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with the live webcast beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning everybody.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, the CapEx cut is pretty material. I wonder if you could help us reconcile Exxon's view of spending through the cycle with the extent of the cut and maybe give us some idea as to maybe just to clarify two things. Where, is really a function of the slowdown in E&P spending? I mean it was already underway, and does it still include the minority affiliate contribution? And I've got a follow-up please.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, yeah. Doug, first let me start with your second question first. The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015.","To answer your first question, I'd first like to say that as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015 both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings and a soft business climate. There was reduced activity and then importantly timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value.","The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going maintain financial flexibility. And we've got, as you've heard us talk in the past, we've got very diverse high-quality inventory investment opportunities that will continue to progress.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Jeff. So yeah, I assume that was one question with a couple of parts to it. So my follow-up is, I realize you've been fairly tight-lipped on Guyana to date. Obviously this is a big acreage that you've had. And there's my understanding is Fugro has already started the subsea survey, which suggests that there's and early production system scheme underway. Can you just give us a general update as to where things stand in Guyana, whether there is indeed an early production system target on how you see the overall scale of the opportunity to the extent you can chat about that at this point? Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah thanks, Doug. I clearly understand the industry interest in the discovery. As we said at the time of discovery, we're very encouraged with the initial results, recognizing that we only have one well in a very, very large block, over 6.5 million acres. We have since the discovery moved quickly to get a drill ship contracted and onsite to appraise the discovery and we expect that to spud very shortly. As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion. The results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as the commercial viability of the Liza discovery.","Obviously the objective of the first well is an appraisal well in Liza and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability. So I would tell you that there are early studies underway on potential development options for the field, but I don't have anything more to share on that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","In the press release you called out some of the project startups and what seemed like a net overall favorable mix effect on income. I think that maybe Western Canada is included in the startups but not maybe a contributor to mix income enhancements. Can you talk about Western Canada, kind of the heavy levels of pressure we're seeing on heavy oil out there? And maybe frame an outlook for us.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, sure. I mean no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment. As I had said before, we remain very focused on the fundamentals. And I'd tell you that the team there in Canada have done just an exceptional job in driving the cost structure down and enhancing reliability. We are not by any means where we want to be. In fact I would tell you that we're never satisfied with the status quo. We will continue to work that, recognizing that we feel very good about the resource potential, not only in Kearl, but in Western Canada in our portfolio. We think that over the long term, the asset's going be a high value. The focus is around maintaining cash profit and maximizing long-term value in the asset.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. And it's sort of on the other end of the same spectrum I guess is LNG, which is considered by many investors to be cost prohibitive but actually has a pretty low overhead once it's operating. Can you help us understand how that contributed this quarter and through the year, specifically with PNG and some of the positive income contributions there.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Sure. I mean, Sam, it's a great question. Because LNG clearly is a key component of our portfolio and it is an important part of our margin generation. Remember, we're constructive on long-term demand. For gas, as you just saw the recent update on our energy outlook, we got gas growing about 1.6% per year. LNG is anticipated to triple between now and 2040. So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term.","I will tell you that for, let's use PNG as a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did a exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is getting more out of the asset. And we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result. And we're still going. So it's a good example of how we really continue to manage the existing assets to reduce the cost structure and improve operational reliability to maximize long-term asset value.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You bet, Sam.","Operator","We'll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Jeff, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question is just kind of a bigger picture macro question. Obviously pricing has been tough across all end markets, oil, natural gas, LNG. And I'm just curious if you see a fundamental supply\/demand improvement happening in any one particular market versus another over the next year or two. So for example, do you see oil recovering faster than natural gas or anything else along those lines?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, so I guess I'd say that we're price takers. And we manage the business to create margin through self help. We have built this business to ensure that it's durable in a low price environment. And then any upside from that is additional return on the investment. So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated, we're for both gas and oil. We're constructive on long-term demand growth and is the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near-term, demand's been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have, I mean the first half of this year, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases.","We got to come in balance, like we have seen historically. We do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG. As I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. The second question is just on the capital spending guidance. Thanks for giving us the preview ahead of the Analyst Day. I guess what I was wondering was, year over year how much of that you might attribute to project roll-off or deflationary benefits versus a reduction in activity. And just in general, you came in under the 2015 budget as you said. How much flexibility is there do you think relative to the guidance number versus that being kind of the lowest you could go?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, Phil, I don't have specific numbers to quote with you. I mean, and as I said we'll talk more about our investment plans and our thoughts on volumes next month in the analyst meeting. But a couple things to share with you. Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build into our spend pattern.","As we go forward, I would tell you right now most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we've slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward. But short of that, I really don't have any more specifics to share as to breaking the CapEx spend down further. We'll continue to live within our means as we've shown historically, and if we need be, we'll have to tighten up if we have to further.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you see some additional flexibility even relative to this guidance?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","We've got flexibility both ways.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good day. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Exxon's unique, relatively unique in its ability and dedication to counter-cyclically spend. Can you discuss the decision to cut the buyback in that context, and is that reduction any reflection on relative attractiveness of the portfolio, value of the stock or a weaker macro outlook?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","No, I mean we've got a very, as I said a very deep and diverse portfolio. Much of that investment could be moved forward in today's environment, but as I indicated, we have a real opportunity to go ahead and rethink some of those expenditure patterns and capture more value from those investments. So the decision to cut the buyback doesn't at all reflect the quality of the inventory. Quite the contrary. I mean the inventory is very robust.","The decision on the buyback, as we've said before, our capital allocation approach is really focused on the dual priority of funding attractive investments and continuing to provide a reliable and growing dividend, and the share buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. As we continue to progress in a very challenging business climate, you saw us prudently taper back the buyback program. We will continue to evaluate the buyback program on a quarterly basis depending on changes in the business as well as the investment climate, and advise on a quarterly basis when we think it's, when it's appropriate.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Maybe if I can shift gears into the US. You're currently running I think seven rigs in the Bakken and eight rigs in the Permian. I mean maybe particularly in the Bakken, what's the driver of continued activity at current prices? I mean are those economic wells, or are you preserving efficiencies for an ultimate reacceleration? And maybe the same question for the Permian, yet that might be kind of HBP driven. Any color would be helpful.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, Evan, it's a good question because we have a very extensive well inventory in our unconventional business, particularly in the liquids plays, the Permian, Bakken and the Woodford Ardmore. Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp-up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we were very measured in how we ramped up because we wanted to ensure that we fully developed the learning curve and captured those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully developed these fields.","So the investments that we're making right now are economic. They're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got. We're one of the few that can continue to invest in a down cycle. We've high-graded all the services that we get in our unconventional business. In fact, I'd extend that globally. And we are continuing on those learning curves, and I think it just better positions us to maximize the value from these assets.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","So on slides 25 and 26 you talked about the project portfolio and the growth trajectory longer term. Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth is coming at the expense of returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other supermajors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level of the past two decades and in some cases three decades. My question is whether or not the issues of structure and returns and growth are being revisited internally, maybe more so than in the past. Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today? And then also whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation, is still as relevant as it used to be. So two questions.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yes. Doug, on the first one, I mean your point about value creation in our investment program, we couldn't agree with you more. And I would tell you that it is never \u2013 our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the, I'd say in the early 2000s to the mid 2010 timeframe, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we could make a investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture that ultimately was going improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of non-productive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came onstream, that they were going be accretive to our overall average financial performance.","So unfortunately as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless we still feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets. Because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately we believe that these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so, had an impact on our return on capital employed are going be accretive to our financial performance over the long term and we believe they were the right decision. Now to your second question on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Maybe there will be a returns and valuation and catch-up in a more normalized environment in the future then.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","That's correct.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good morning. Congrats on obviously $11.5 billion of capital and OpEx savings. OpEx, you haven't really spoken about as much this morning. Just maybe run through some of the actions you took to reduce OpEx over the course of last year and then the potential to cut OpEx further.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, thanks for that, Ed, because it is a very important story of our 2015 performance. First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of that is operating expenses, and it includes a number of things positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture.","Remember, I've talked in the past about having a unique organization or global procurement organization that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, includes benefits from our asset management program as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously we've been talking about all these new projects coming onstream. With them comes an increase in operating costs. And we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year.","So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year on year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx and includes a lot of the same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our planned guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year on year reduction in CapEx was $7.5 billion. So we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year on year our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, and then in terms of the ability to drive further OpEx, I mean another 10%, another 15%, I mean how low do you think you can get that OpEx saving?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","It's a great question, Ed. It really is, because it really talks to the strength of the organization. In this low price environment, it presents opportunities too. And the organization is never satisfied with the status quo. The organization is very focused on leading that cost curve. And while we may have some internal stewardship objectives, rest assured that we continue to look for new unique ways to capture structural improvements which are most important, because remember, those are the ones that will be permanent going forward. So there's a lot more to work on. But I don't have any specific numbers at this point.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I look forward to the Analyst Day. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Maybe if I could follow-up on the comment that you've made a couple of times now. You've talked about how you guys are rethinking near term investments and the way you deploy capital. I mean how much does this refer to an evolution of your views on relative attractiveness amongst various components of the portfolio in terms of, does this represent at all a shift in attractiveness of onshore versus deepwater versus oil sands or LNG, et cetera? Or how much is just referring to rethinking the cost structure in the near term environment in an effort to continue to push down prices?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","It's really both. It's every investment dollar is competing. So it's all about how do we get the most value out of those investment dollars that are being deployed throughout the business. The organization, as I indicated, really views the down cycle as a real opportunity to go back and retest development concepts, retest the cost structures, retest the commercial terms. And whether it's short cycle or long cycle, we're going to maintain that competitive focus and make the right value choices coupled with our prudent cash management.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up on that, I mean during the most recent downturn in 2008, 2009, you took advantage of the environment by pushing through more counter-cyclical investment in places like the Canadian oil sands. And I think we all realize that this downturn is different, but do you see similar opportunities to leverage your strength in this environment, either on the cost and project development side or maybe even on the research acquisition side? Or is your outlook different enough at this point that you feel that more prudence is necessary in the short to medium term?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Well I mean clearly, given the uncertainty in prices, we're going to maintain prudency. But at the same time, as I've said a couple times, Ryan, we really do see that this is an opportunity to capture further value in the bottom of the cycle, and across all the areas I've already mentioned. But there are plenty of opportunities that the organization's focused on to really make that value proposition. And I'd also add that because of our ability to invest through this cycle, our service providers understand that if they can provide lower-cost, higher-value solutions to us, then we'll continue to invest if it makes good business sense. So having not only the organization focused on it, but also our service providers focused on it has provided some unique opportunities for us.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Jeff, I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the analyst meeting. I know that Mr. Tillerson's been in New York a couple of times \u2013 I should say in New York and in Miami making some statements. I haven't personally spoken to him since last March. The general message that you had then was certainly that we would be lower for longer. I assume he's still making that argument. I think that he was saying that you guys would be typically keen to make acquisitions at the bottom of the cycle, but the bid\/ask spreads were too wide. He was saying less interest in buying a balance sheet that was bad. He would prefer to buy a balance sheet that was good, and I think you've said that consolidation in the Permian would be an area of interest. Is that the latest message that we've got, for example, at the Miami conference? I'm sorry, I wasn't present. I was wondering if the message has changed. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, well I mean from a supply\/demand perspective, I shared some of our thoughts around expectations. Clearly the oversupply currently and the overhang from storage is going to have a dampening effect on prices in the near term. But Paul, as we've talked in the past, we continue to be focused on the fundamentals and through our self-help creating margin, and that's what's most important for this business. We invest to ensure that the business is durable at low prices. We continue to manage the business based on our focus on the fundamentals to create margin. From a acquisition perspective, clearly I'm sure there's a tremendous amount of interest. We remain very patient. We keep alert to the value propositions. But it's as I've said before, anything that we see out there has got be competitive with our current investment inventory.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. I mean the bid\/ask spread element, is that, must \u2013 I mean by just looking at the share price charts, that has to be narrowing now between what you guys would see as value and what sellers would.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah. Well I mean clearly, bid\/asks could be a function of a number of factors including the business climate, unique capabilities and assessments of individual investors. And certainly, the longer the commodity prices are in this area code, the more pressure it will put on the bid\/ask. But I think also, Paul, as you're probably well aware, I mean the absence of any major deals absent a few couple one-offs really talks that there's still a gap to valuations. We'll be thoughtful. We'll make sure that anything that looks of interest is going to be value adding.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Indeed. And then a bit of a technical question. Does Mr. Tillerson retire on his 65th birthday, or at the beginning of 2017 typically? I mean, what would be the model? I guess what I'm driving at is, is this going to be his last analyst meeting?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, well I mean I'm not going to provide any specifics. That's really at the function of the board's decision.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","All right. Thank you, Paul.","Operator","And we'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess I'd like to follow-up a little more on your Lower 48. You talked earlier about the rig count and trying to maintain spending within a reasonable level of returns, but balancing that against the maintaining the right amount of service sector capability and all. But as you look at Lower 48 volume growth, which was certainly reasonable in the past year, does it grow in 2016 at these levels? And I know you wouldn't necessarily start with the idea of growth, but does it grow at these levels?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah. Well I don't have any specifics to share with you right now. But I would tell you, think about this, is that the choices that we are making are all based on value propositions. The outcome of those will be volumes. And as I indicated earlier, Roger, we've got a very deep portfolio of investment opportunities in the Lower 48, particularly in the unconventional business. And we'll maintain an appropriate balance of short-cycle investments. And when we feel like that the business climate supports it, we'll probably increase the amount of activity. I think what's important to note is that we are very well poised to flex the program up or down depending on the business climate.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Appreciate that. The other question I had was on the share repo program, understand taking it off the table for now. If you were to get a surprise influx of cash flow, just say higher commodity prices, is the decision in the near term that it would likely go towards shareholder returns or that CapEx would go up? I know Exxon is not a quick trigger place like some other businesses, but you do have opportunities as you've said in the Lower 48. What's sort of the internal thinking on that front?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Well, I mean if it was an influx of cash flow, I would tell you that it's going to be a function of the board's decision on a quarterly basis. I mean, if we see supply and demand continuing to balance out, that may be a signal for us to modify our investment plans going forward. But as I've indicated previously, Roger, the board makes the decision on a quarterly basis on what level of buybacks we want to maintain, and consider a whole range of factors including the business climate in making that decision.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. So Powerball lottery by itself doesn't do it. You have to have some other fundamental things helping you out.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah really.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you, Roger.","Operator","We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So Jeff, you've had a great year here of production. This is something where I'm sure we'll get more clarity in March. But can you just talk about at $23 billion, how you think about the level of production relative to the 4.2 million barrels a day that you outlined last year for 2016, and then which, broadly speaking, which regions where you would see potential changes?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah well, Neil, let me first just take an opportunity to acknowledge a very strong operational year in 2015. Achieving the 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day which I'll just want to emphasize for the group. It's really an outcome of our value choices that we've made. The organization has really delivered on the timely startup of our major projects, which are a very key and significant contribution to our volumes this year.","I'll say looking forward, as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we have 10 more large-scale long-life projects starting up over the next couple of years. The first, the next tranche of that will be six of the 10 starting up in 2016. We maintained a very strong focus on the high-value work program as well as operational reliability. Looking forward, we will be sharing more on our near term investment plans and some thoughts on our volumes in the upcoming analyst meeting. But I really don't have any more specifics to share with you at this point.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that, Jeff. And then obviously one of Exxon's key advantages here is your balance sheet. In light of some of the comments from the ratings agencies, can you just talk about your commitment to your AAA rating here? And then any perspective that you can provide around how that could change as ratings agencies think about their market outlook.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah it's a good question, Neil, and clearly it's topical for many in the energy sector. I mean first and foremost, let me just be clear. We get value from the AAA credit rating in our business, whether it be access to financial markets or access to resources. I mean there is a benefit that we get from it, and we see it as being important. But it is really an outcome of our longstanding effective management of the business, including things like our strong balance sheet, the way we have prudently managed our cash, our disciplined investment and our leading financial and operating results, all of which has allowed us the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle as we've been discussing. I'd tell you that the current environment is clearly tough. But we've managed the business to be durable on the low end of commodity prices. We're very well positioned to continue the same level with superior performance in the future and we think that all underpins the strong credit rating that we have.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Jeff, good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two really quick questions. The $23.2 billion, how much is related to the (1:03:59) and also that within that number, how much is for the major project spending?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You're talking about our 2016?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, sir.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","CapEx guidance.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","We'll provide, Paul, we'll provide you more information on our spending plans in the analyst meeting. I really don't have anything more to share at this point.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see, okay. The second one then real quick. It looked like you have $800 million on the asset sales proceed. What is the asset sales gain in the quarter? And that also do you have, it seems like that you may have some tax adjustment benefit in the quarter, and that you have also mentioned I think some FX impact and also inventory impact. Can you quantify those items in the quarter and if possible, by segment also?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yes, so Paul, on the proceeds from asset sales which was about $800 million in the fourth quarter, the equivalent earnings impact is about $350 million, primarily in the Downstream. Could you talk a little bit more about the second question, just make sure I?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, it looked like that the effective tax rate is 13% in the quarter. We understand the mix of the earning, oftentimes the impact, the absolute level of the tax, but it does look like it's low enough that you may have some tax benefit or adjustment, year-end adjustment on that. Just curious if that's the case. And if it is, can you quantify it? What is the tax adjustment benefit and also that which segment is being impact? And also that I think in your prepared remark, you have comment that some impact on the earnings on the FX and also inventory. So just want to see if you can quantify those.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Sure, sure, okay. Let me walk through them for you. On ForEx, the quarter on quarter impact is essentially nil. I mean it's a slight negative to earnings, less than $5 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","How about sequentially?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","I'm sorry, say that again.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sequentially you're talking about right, this one closest to?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","That was quarter on quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2014. The full year had a negative impact on our earnings of about $125 million. That's ForEx, okay. On tax, so yes, our effective tax rate was 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was down about 19% quarter on quarter. A fair bit of that had to do with one-time tax items. The rest, about 5%, was due to portfolio mix of income across the business segments and the geographies. And that's really spread across our corporate and finance as well as some of the segments.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jeff, when you say that one-time tax item, 14%, seems like you're talking about 14% because you say 19% overall reduction, 5% is due to the mix of the asset, and so the one-time item is 14%. Is that 14% spread across different segment or it is primarily in Upstream?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","It's in corporate and finance and several of the other segments. I don't have a breakdown for you.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And how about inventory impact?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, before I leave tax, I just want to be clear for everybody that assuming our current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we still would anticipate that the effective tax rate is between 35% to 40%. If you look at the full year of tax in 2015, it was just under 34% and that included obviously some one-time tax effects. Okay? On inventory, Paul, quarter on quarter, it had a negative earnings impact of about $375 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Okay. You're welcome, Paul.","Operator","And we'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Anish.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi. Good morning. Just had a question looking at production and declines. If we look at 2015, it seems like underlying production was flat. So we saw new projects that were offset by production declines. I wanted to try and understand in terms of 2016 how much of your CapEx is going into the base business and to mitigate declines. And so what do you see the underlying decline rate to be with the current spend? Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Anish, we have an underlying decline, as we included in our 10-K, of about 3%. On top of that, we add major project activity. Again, I don't break it out by use, and we'll talk more about investment plans in the analyst meeting next month.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay. And just to clarify on that, so given the CapEx cuts that we've seen, you wouldn't expect that decline rate to accelerate on the back of the CapEx cuts?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","No. Remember, it's a base decline rate ex-major project activity.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay. The second question was on plans for space for new major projects. Given that cutback in the CapEx, do you have any potential FIDs for this year that you're looking to sanction?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, on FIDs, we just don't forecast FIDs in advance of the investment decision made by the corporation. When we make that decision, when the investments get to a level of maturity and we make that decision, then we communicate. I'll remind you that we have 10 major projects that will start up in the next two years, as I indicated before, and they will certainly...","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Can I just?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","And they will certainly contribute to our base performance.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","I just wanted to clarify, I think I might have missed it from earlier. I mean there was a question on the impact of production from the cutback in your rigs. What would you expect your exit to exit US onshore production to be this year?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Well as I indicated, we'll share more about our investment plans as well as our thoughts on volumes in next month's analyst meeting. We've got a very deep, robust inventory of development projects in the Upstream, and we'll talk more about that next month, or I guess, yeah, next month.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Sure. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Oh yes, hi. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Morning, Jason.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","I was hoping you might be able to just give us a little bit of the detail on those project startups that you're expecting in 2016 and 2017, just to make sure my list is correct. And if you want to share the contribution that the 2016 startups are making towards that 250 kpd capacity, that would be helpful as well.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, on the startups in 2016, of course we've got Gorgon, Jansz. We have late in the year Kashagan. We've got Julia in the Gulf of Mexico, Heidelberg in the Gulf of Mexico, Point Thomson in Alaska and Barzan in Qatar. And Jason, we provide the peak level of capacity in our F&O.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. So that probably hasn't changed too much since that was published then.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","No, and we'll provide an update to that list next month as well.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Got it. And if I could just ask one more, Jeff, on the Downstream. You've put in place a couple of projects in Europe to potentially take advantage of heavier feedstocks over time, let's see, Antwerp being the primary one. I was hoping you'd talk about what you're seeing just in terms of those heavier feedstocks within Europe and how the profitability's evolving on that.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, thanks for the question on the Downstream, because the organization has really performed tremendously in the year. Our investments in the Downstream, particularly in Europe, are really focused on the following items, one, to increase feedstock flexibility, The second is to increase logistics flexibility. The third one is to increase higher value product yields. And I'll come back to that. And then the last and important one is fully capturing the integration value of our manufacturing facilities and reducing our cost structure.","On the higher value product yields, when we talk about Antwerp or Rotterdam, both are achieving the same objective. On Antwerp, we're converting bunker fuel oil into ultra-low sulfur diesel, again constructive on longer-term supply\/demand. And in Rotterdam we're converting VGO into premium Group II basestocks and as well ultra-low sulfur diesel.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's great. Appreciate that, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Great. You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Asit Sen with CLSA.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Hi, Asit.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Two questions. One very quick one on Banyu Urip. Nice ramp-up there. When do you get to peak and any update on the size of recoverable resource? I think that's 450 million barrels and cost I thought you guys mentioned, $3 billion.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, so the size of the resource, let me just confirm your number. It's about 450 million barrels gross. The ramp-up, we should be up at full rates somewhere in the first half of this year.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay and the cost, I think $3 billion?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You know, Asit, I don't think we've shared the cost publicly.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Okay. All right. And then moving on to LNG. Thanks for your color on the long-term LNG market. Just wondering if you could share any read into emerging near-term trend, LNG particularly response in China to a lower pricing environment? Given your comment on China deceleration, I thought that was a overall comment. And also on LNG, any update on Golden Pass?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, I guess two points. On the near-term expectation of LNG, there's a number of projects, some of which are already coming online that are probably going to take us above demand for a period of time, say into 2020 to 2023 when the supply and demand will start coming to converge again. So clearly, I mean it's going have a pressure on those volumes that are trading on the spot market.","Just to remind everybody, when we make a investment decision on these projects, we lock in our investment decisions on long-term contracts. Golden Pass, we have submitted our formal application with FERC to construct and operate the project. We're working closely with the federal and state agencies for completing the review process in 2016. The final investment decision will be made once we've gone through the government and regulatory approvals.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Research","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Allen.","Allen Good - Morningstar Research","I wonder if given all the changes that we've seen in the oil markets over the last call it 18 months, has Exxon revised the range of prices that it uses to evaluate investment decisions?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Well I'd say, Allen, that we continue to see that the range is applicable, given our constructive review on supply and demand. We won't speculate on specific prices or differentials. We certainly expect the weakness until supply and demand comes back into balance and the storage overhang is worked off. As I've said a few times, Allen, regardless of what the price is doing, we're going to keep on focused on those things that we control, which really translates into self-help margin.","Allen Good - Morningstar Research","Thanks, that helps. And then deepwater offshore, a very big part of Exxon's portfolio, getting bigger from what you've shared today. Can you give any indication as to what Exxon's seeing with respect to either cost savings via equipment or services or maybe even cost savings on the redesign of certain projects that will ultimately lower the breakevens and make them more competitive within your portfolio?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, really good question. There's a lot of different variables in this, one in terms of the quality of the resources and the certainty on overall potential from those resources. Another one being how do we get the structural capital efficiency built in so that the economics are more robust. I'll highlight a couple things. One, in 2015, you'll recall in West Africa we brought on two very capital-efficient subsea tiebacks to the existing infrastructure, one being the Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, another one being Erha North Phase 2, that allows us to leverage existing knowledge and develop the deepwater resource in a much more cost-effective way. Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity to continue to standardize the subsea kit, but the organization is looking at all the levers to improve the economics of deepwater. In the Gulf of Mexico, I should note that Hadrian South was another example of an efficient, capital-efficient subsea tieback into existing infrastructure.","Allen Good - Morningstar Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious back on CapEx, I would assume that Downstream is relatively flat sequentially and that the vast majority of the cut is coming from the Upstream side.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, we'll provide more insight on that, Brad. But as you saw in 2015, our Downstream and Chemical spending plan increased with a number of very large projects that we saw significant value chain benefit, with the polyethylene trains in Baytown to the European investments that we've already talked about. And of course, those projects are continuing as you go into 2016 and start up into 2017. So the trend is going to continue going forward.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah hi, Jeff. A couple quick ones from me since so many things have been asked. For the Liza offset well, will we be talking about this in the second quarter conference or in the first quarter conference call? Or will it TD by then?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","So, John, I don't really have the specifics. When we believe there's something that would be important to share externally, we'll go ahead and share it. I just don't know whether the first quarter will be the appropriate time or not at this point.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine. Many of your peers, Jeff, are restructuring. They're rightsizing or downsizing. Exxon hasn't had any news like that. So are there any plans in the work or do you feel that you have an adequately sized workforce given your business model?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, it's a good question, John, and I appreciate you asking it. Let me first say for the group's benefit that one of our greatest strengths are our people. And I think those of us that went through the layoffs in the 1980s really learned some of the hard lessons about how those layoffs significantly impaired organizational effectiveness. I mean since then, we have been very diligent at managing employee head count given the cyclical nature of the business and the need by the organization to be ever more productive and at the same time grow collective competency to meet the challenges in front of us. In doing so, I'd also say that we've been unrelenting on our focus of capturing efficiencies to make sure that we rightsize the organization, again given the likelihood of business volatility.","I'd also highlight, John, that another benefit of our integrated business model is that we're able to be agile in redeploying personnel to segments of our business that are experiencing market strength or growth, such as our Downstream and Chemical businesses right now. All that said, our employee head count has been coming down consistently since the Exxon and Mobil merger. We're down about 35% through 2015. Over that time period, if you look at just the last five years, we're down about 20%. And I can rest assured that the organization's going to continue to be focused on productivity enhancements and making sure that we're getting all the efficiencies out of the business.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Sure. But you haven't had anything that's knee jerk or reactionary as some of your peers of late? It's just been part of your normal plan, correct?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","That's correct.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","All right, thanks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you, John.","Operator","We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. You talk about entering acreage in some new geographies, particularly some frontier type of geographies. Since the oil down cycle began, have you noticed fiscal terms becoming more accommodating in any areas? And if you can provide any examples that would be great.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Pavel. I would tell you that certainly given the downturn, there are more opportunities for us to consider. There is nothing that I can share with you specifically, but it does speak to the strength of Exxon Mobil given that we've got the capability to invest through the down cycle. We bring a tremendous amount of operational, commercial and project expertise. So it allows us to be very selective as to what choices we want to pursue with a very strong focus on placing our attention on those areas that are close to existing producing infrastructure, those areas that have very high quality large resource potential.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Appreciate it.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you, Pavel.","Operator","And we'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for answering all the questions.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","I know this is a tough question to answer, but I'm interested in how you think about this strategically. But given the scale of the CapEx reductions we're seeing, how do you think about the sustainability of these lower organic spending levels with respect to being sufficient to drive a modest level of production growth for the portfolio, yet also replenish the resource base? Are you spending now below what you believe is sustainable? And how do you think about the balance between spending at a sustainable level versus perhaps rationing lower to limit your out spend for a period of time?","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah, I would tell you, Guy, to really think about the decisions that we're making are really value driven. The output is really the volumes, but it's really making the choices that are aligned with creating value in the portfolio, whether it be in the Upstream or the Downstream or Chemical business, recognizing that we've got this integration, this very strong integration across our portfolio that we can create value through the whole value chain. So the choices are really focused on making sure that we're creating incremental value. The volumes will be an output of that.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Got it. That's helpful, Jeff. And then last one for me, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but given your global perspective, your participation in various Downstream markets across the globe, can you give us the view on leading-edge global oil demand growth for 2016? Any color would be great as it's obviously a critical piece of the global supply\/demand balance.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah. Well, I mean you're talking about oil demand?","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Yes. Yes. Specifically oil demand.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Yeah. Well I talked a little bit earlier about underlying demand growth has been over 1 million barrels per day, so it's been a little bit higher than what we've seen over the 10-year average. You think about where we are today, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day oversupply in the first half. We do expect that to converge in the second half with seasonal demand growth. So you think about the impact on prices in the near term, it's really going be a function of how that supply\/demand converges, and of course working off the storage overhang that's been built up over the last couple years. That's about all I can share at this point.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Got it. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Jeff Woodbury for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary","Well, thank you. To conclude, again I'd like to thank you for your time and questions. I just want to step back for a moment and take stock of 2015 and say the organization really did a very significant, provided a very significant result when you think about it: positive free cash flow; very effective cost management, lowering our spending that had bottom line impacts, benefits to the business; our excellence in project execution and our delivering long-life, long-plateau volumes; the benefits of the integrated business model across the value chain; the financial strength of the organization, investing through the commodity price cycle; and then of course our dividend growth, continuing to share the success of the company.","And I think that just points to the strong business fundamentals based on our proven track record. We'll talk more about this in March, but we do appreciate your interest in Exxon Mobil and we certainly look forward to meeting with you next month.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"8293":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 30, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","","David Rosenthal \u2013 VP, IR and Secretary","Analysts","","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.","Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, with mixed performance across the region. Moderate U.S. economic growth was sustained. China\u2019s growth rate stabilized which Europe\u2019s economic recovery remained sluggish. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices decreased more than more than $8 per barrel widening the discount to Brent as the global marker was only slightly lower in the quarter.","Henry Hub natural gas prices were essentially flat. Global industry refining margins strengthened as stronger U.S. margins were partially offset by continued market weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. Chemical commodity product margins also declined over the quarter.","Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were just under $8.4 billion or $1.91 per share. The corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total $3 billion was used to purchase shares.","CapEx was $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12 billion. At the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.9 billion and debt was $22.7 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash decreased from $5.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $8.4 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.8 million. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $1.4 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the first quarter of 2014.","Moving on to slide six and a review of our segmented results ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of just under $8.4 billion decreased by $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012. Lower earnings across all business segments were partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide seven earnings increase by $480 million as higher upstream and downstream earnings and lower corporate and financing expenses were partially offset by lower chemical earning. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide eight, upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $6.8 billion, down $976 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. Realizations increased earnings by $60 million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased by $0.41 per 1,000 cubic feet and crude oil decreased by $2.38 per barrel. Unfavorable volume and mix effects including the impact of crude under lifts of West Africa and the North Sea along with lower natural gas production decreased earnings by $550 million.","All other items decreased earnings by $490 million reflecting increased expenses driven by Kearl operating costs and higher planned exploration costs in Russia. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were $17.95 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving now to slide nine production decreased by 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8% from the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 32,000 barrels per day or 1.5%. Ramp up at the Kearl and Nigeria Satellite projects lowered downtime and continued increased production from unconventional plays in the U.S. were partly offset by field decline and price and spend impacts. Natural gas production was down 654 million cubic feet per day primarily due to expected lower U.S. production and field decline in several areas.","Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased by $73 million versus the third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $430 million as worldwide crude prices decreased by $5.89 per barrel and natural gas realizations increased by $0.57 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $90 million, reflecting increased global liquids and natural gas production. All other items had a positive impact of $410 million. Higher gains from asset sales were partially offset by higher operating expenses.","Moving to slide 11, oil equivalent volumes were up 190,000 barrels per day or 4.9% sequentially. Liquids production increased 36,000 barrels per day, mainly due to additional production from work programs in the U.S. and the North Sea, Kearl ramp-up and lower downtime, partly offset by scheduled maintenance in Nigeria and field decline. Natural gas production was up 973 million cubic feet per day mainly due to seasonal demand in Europe.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $916 million, down $852 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 mainly due to lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million driven by refining optimization activities. All other items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $280 million.","Turning to slide 13, sequentially fourth quarter downstream earnings increased by $324 million. Improved refining margins, mainly in North America increased earnings by $120 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $330 million reflecting favorable refining optimization activity. Other items reduced earnings by a net $120 million.","Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 14. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $910 million, down $48 million versus the prior year quarter due to lower specialty product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were mostly offset by other items. Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings decreased by $115 million, primarily due to lower margins in Europe.","Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights and beginning on slide 16. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. Construction at the PNG LNG project is now nearing completion. With the focus shifting to commissioning key facilities and equipment in preparation for first LNG delivery now targeted for the third quarter of this year. Gas has been introduced to both the gas conditioning plants at Hides and the LNG facility in order to progress commissioning activities.","The Kearl expansion project is on budget, is now more than 70% complete and remains on target for 2015 startup. We continue to develop attractive logistic solutions to provide market access for our growing oil sands production from this future additional capacity.","At Upper Zakum we are progressing with our partners the field redevelopment to raise production capacity to 750,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The increase is enabled through the use of four artificial islands of which two are now complete and the extended reach drilling using proprietary Exxon Mobil technology. Similar works and facility additions will continue through 2015. In 2013 the Upper Zakum joint venture was granted a 15 year license extension through 2041. The extension includes enhanced fiscal terms allowing the expansion project to meet our investment criteria and contribute towards Abu Dhabi\u2019s plans to boost production.","In Iraq we reached a production capacity of 500,000 barrels per day at the West Qurna 1 development in 2013. We continue to progress additional capacity expansion through facility debottlenecking, workovers, new drilled wells and well tie-ins. We have also completed 3-D seismic acquisition over the West Qurna 1 field.","In the fourth quarter we executed agreements to sell a combined 35% interest to PetroChina and Pertamina reducing our participation interest from 60% to 25%. We will remain as the lead operator for the project and are committed to maximize value for all parties involved in redeveloping this world class resource.","Turning now to slide 17 for an update on our exploration activities. In Tanzania, the Mronge 1 well discovered an additional two to three TCF of natural gas in place from two separate intervals. The main accumulation is at the same stratographic level is the proven Zafrani 1 well. The secondary accumulation was encountered in a separate gas bearing reservoir in a play previously untested in Block 2. Mronge 1 is the fifth discovery on Block 2 and brings the total of the gas in place up to 17 to 20 TCF. Further exploration drilling is planned for 2014.","In Russia, Exxon Mobil and Rosneft completed joint venture agreements to implement a pilot project for tight oil development in Western Siberia. Operations for the pilot program are under way. We are evaluating data from the 2013 activity which included a mix of workovers and new well drilling. The year 2014 we will focus on drilling and testing new horizontal wells with operations to commence by the third quarter. We are currently finalizing locations to test this high potential resource.","In Argentina we drilled our first operated well and are currently drilling the second operated well in Vaca Muerta shale formation. Previously, we have drilled a total of six Vaca Muerta wells with our co-venturers to progress the evaluation of approximately 900,000 net acres. We have ongoing well operations to gather their production testing data required to validate expected recovery and to support potential development planning.","Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments, which continue to strengthen our global portfolio. During the quarter we achieved several investment milestones. We commissioned a new diesel hydrotreater at our Singapore refinery increasing ultra-low diesel production capacity by 62,000 barrels per day. The new unit along with the recently completed petrochemical expansion project at our Singapore complex positions Exxon Mobil to competitively deliver high value products to the growing Asia Pacific region. We continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency at our facilities.","Worldwide cash operating costs for our portfolio of refineries are well below the industry average and consistently outperform the competition. In November, we commissioned our latest cogeneration facility at our Augusta Refinery in Italy, increasing energy efficiency by 6%.","To support market access for our growing Canadian oil sands production we announced plans to build a crude oil railroad loading facility next to the Strathcona refinery in Edmonton. The terminal will have a capacity of up to 250,000 barrels per day, of which we plan to use a 100,000 barrels per day to supply our refining network. Connections to both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific mainlines will enable efficient, cost effective transportation of heavy crude. Construction is underway and startup is expected in early 2015.","Now I would like to provide a summary of our full year results shown on slide 19. 2013 earnings were $32.6 billion or $7.37 per share. The corporation distributed $25.9 billion to shareholders in 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $15 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2013 was $42.5 billion and includes $4.3 billion for acquisitions. Base full year CapEx of $38.2 billion was in line with our spending plans. Cash flows from operations and asset sales remains robust at $47.6 billion, which included $2.7 billion from asset sales.","Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on slide 20. During the year cash decreased from $9.9 billion to $4.9 billion. The combined impact of earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $47.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $33.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $25.9 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $7 billion.","Moving on to slide 21 and a review of our fiscal year segmented results. 2013 earnings decreased by $12.3 billion. Lower net gains from divestments account for 70% or $8.6 billion of the reduced earnings. Lower earnings across all business segments were partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.","Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results and starting on slide 22. Upstream earnings were $26.8 billion, down $3.1 billion for 2012. Improved natural gas realizations partially offset by lower crude oil realizations increased earnings by $390 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects including the impact of crude under-lifts in West Africa and lower natural gas production decreased earnings by $910 million. All other items including lower gains from asset sales, higher expenses driven by Kearl start-up and operating cost and higher planned exploration cost in Russia reduced earnings by $2.5 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the year were $18.03 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.","Moving to slide 23, volumes decreased by 1.5% or 64,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2012. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments production was essentially flat. Liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day. Ramp-up at the Kearl and Nigeria projects, lower downtime and increased U.S production were partly offset by fuel decline and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 486 million cubic feet per day. As expected lower U.S. production, field decline in several areas and full year AKG entitlement impacts in Qatar were partly offset by increased weather related demand in Europe and project ramp-ups.","On slide 24, we show actual 2013 production volumes compared to the outlook we provided at the Analyst meeting last March. Overall total production volumes were in-line with our target of 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day, with liquids production slightly below target and gas production slightly higher. Several positive factors contributed to this result, including strong uptime performance, increased North America unconventional liquids production and higher European gas demand for the year.","These factors mostly offset the lower than expected volume contribution from Kearl and the loss of Kashagan volumes due to the pipeline issue currently being investigated. During the fourth quarter we continue to ramp up Kearl production, including making several upgrades to the steam system and filtration units to improve overall reliability. Average Kearl production for the fourth quarter and full year was 47,000 and 21,000 barrels per day respectively and production rates of 100,000 barrels per day were reached by the end of the year.","Full year comparison for the downstream is shown on slide 25. 2013 earnings were $3.4 billion, down $9.7 billion from 2012. Lower refining margins across all regions reduced earnings by $2.9 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $310 million as higher planned maintenance activities in the U.S. and Europe was partly offset by refining optimization activities. Other items, including the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring and other divestments reduced earnings a total of $6.6 billion.","On slide 26 we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2013 earnings were $3.8 billion. Higher commodity margins, partly offset by lower specialty margins increased earnings by $480 million. Volume and mix effects also increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to strong U.S. commodity demand. Other effects reduced earnings by $630 million, mainly due to the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring.","Moving to slide 27, in conclusion in 2013 we earned $32.6 billion, generated $47.6 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, invested $42.5 billion in the business and distributed $25.9 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial and operating performance reflects the benefit of our integrated business model and other sustainable competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value.","We achieved total production in line with our target and continue to progress attractive opportunities across our unique and balanced portfolio. Base full year CapEx spending was also in-line with our plans. Our cash flow remains strong and enables robust shareholder distributions.","Finally I would like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February we will be releasing our 2013 reserves replacement data. Second, as many of you will already have seen our upcoming analyst meeting will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 5th. We will include a live webcast beginning at 9 AM Eastern, 8 AM Central Time. Presentation will be led by Exxon Mobil\u2019s Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning how are you?","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","I am doing fine. My question is about European E&P and specifically whether or not we could get clarification on the supply restriction at Groningen meaning it seems like 20% reduction in output is going to be required from the partners during the next three years which I think equates to about 60,000 BOE per day of heavy duty net Exxon Mobil. So is it the correct way to think about the supply effect and the duration of the restriction and just any color on that situation will be appreciated.","David Rosenthal","Yeah Doug I\u2019ll be happy to give you a little perspective on the Groningen situation. Let me start by saying that the government\u2019s draft decision does include a production decrease for the next three years of about 7% compared to average production over the average of the last few years. If this indicated \u2013 this off take limit is final it would have an impact of approximately, on ExxonMobil 100 MCF a day net production in 2014 versus the average of the last several years.","Now compared to 2013 which as I mentioned was a year of very high production due to weather-related demand, there would be a decrease of about 20% and that\u2019s consistent with what was communicated by the Dutch government. The proposed curtailment is not final, it will take a little bit of time to finalize it. But if implemented again the impact on us relative to a normal year is about 100 MCF a day.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. Sorry go ahead.","David Rosenthal","I am sorry. Let me just make one of the comment to keep it in perspective and add a little color, in terms of the financial impact on the company while Groningen is of course very attractive asset in our upstream, the unit profitability is in the bottom half of our portfolio. And so the earnings impact is not as great as I think some people might have expected.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay, good point. And then just second in U.S. downstream, obviously you guys have a several leading position in the mid-continent naturally benefited from wide differential to the last couple of years. But wondered if we could get an update on the program to secure advantage [inaudible] or what have you for the refineries outside of mid-conn. So any elaboration on this is appreciated. I think you guys talked about a little bit on the Gulf Coast, at the analysts meetings, so just an update there would be appreciated.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, sure, in general if you look at our mid-conn footprint which as we talked about before is one of the largest in the industry. And our Gulf Coast refining footprint is also one of the largest. So we got a lot going on in terms of making sure that we can get the Western Canadian crudes down into the circuit and also take advantage of the light sweet crude. And we are, pipelines, rail, barge, we are using all of the logistics opportunities available to us to optimize those barrels getting to refineries, and that\u2019s a big piece of what you see in these positive, volume mix effects on our earnings both quarter-to-quarter, sequentially and that sort of thing.","Particularly if you look at that sequential comparison where we\u2019ve really been able to optimize the sea slate we\u2019re running and of course, take advantage of butane pricing as we switch over to winter grade fuels, and so that\u2019s been helpful to us as well. But we are actively progressing that and the fourth quarter was a good one for us. And I might just mention one other thing that makes that important in the earnings comparison, we did have in the fourth quarter alone about $ 250 million of negative price timing effects. So that hurt on the margin side, gets somewhat offset by some of these refining optimization efforts that we talked about.","So we continue to work on that. One of the things that helps is being fully integrated across the downstream and upstream and chemical and having a worldwide supply department to help us on this. But you can rest assured from Canada all the way down to the Gulf Coast we are fully optimizing and taking advantage of our integration opportunities.","Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Great thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, first question on the production lines, I guess, from your comments I can disaggregate the impact from Kearl and Kashagan in the 4th quarter. Can you provide any outlook into 2014 on Kearl, what\u2019s the ramp and more color there? And on Kashagan which you mentioned is there any prognosis for the production return, the state of the gas leak repairs and I have a follow-up, thanks.","David Rosenthal","Sure, let me start with Kearl. I can\u2019t give you an exact time when we would expect to reach our full production capabilities. I will say although the Kearl volumes did come in over the course of years, I mentioned less than our expectation going in, and certainly part of the volume outlook we shared with you last March, we did achieve a number of milestones in cranking that project up. We have been able to run each of the three froth treatment trains at their maximum capacity on a combined basis. We\u2019ve been able to reach rates at a 100,000 barrels per day.","What we are working on now is how do we improve the reliability so that we can run at those rates on a consistent basis. So we continue to make progress there. And again as I think I have mentioned in prior calls the good news for us is all the technology is working, the trains work, the equipment works. It\u2019s simply then just a matter of start-up and this complex kit we got on the ground and working some of these reliability issues that I mentioned. But they are all fixable. We\u2019re working on it. We are making progress. But I wouldn\u2019t want to give you an exact date in terms of full capacity but we\u2019ll give you an update at the Analyst meeting in March and probably be in a better position to help you with some outlook on that.","With regard to Kashagan n, as you know oil and gas production does remain shut in. We are investigating. We\u2019ve got the best experts in the world looking at this. We\u2019re investigating the root cause of the pipeline leaks and the seeps. That\u2019s going to take a little more time. We do know that the immediate cause of the leaks has been sulphide stress cracking but we\u2019re still investigating to establish what\u2019s the cause of the sulphide stress cracking. And that is ongoing. There\u2019s a lot of work going on, a lot of analysis underway, but I just couldn\u2019t give you an outlook, I know there is some speculation out there at various times but I will be hesitant to try to give you an outlook until we know more about both the cause and extent of the leaks and therefore what it\u2019s going to take to repair and get that equipment back in service.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay this is helpful. And my second question is on \u2013 it also relates to the production, and 2014 production. Thank you for the color on Groningen. I guess there, is there any ability to offset volumes from other European fields as it\u2019s largely a demand driven market. And secondly another area which has been which profitable and a marquee investment for Exxon in Kearl LNG, I mean any color there on the relative contribution as you move through various contract thresholds in those contracts would be helpful. Thanks.","David Rosenthal","Yeah let me start off with Groningen. As you know it is the swing field in Europe and tends to take the balance of what\u2019s needed, depending on weather typically unless there are some supply disruption and so that\u2019s really what drives the production there year-to-year more so than capacity. In terms of ability to offset you know we\u2019re already working everything we got, as you know our continental Europe conventional gas is on decline, North Sea gas is on decline so we do feed LNG into that circuit out of the Middle-East. But it has to compete with prices that you can get in Asia Pacific.","So we\u2019ll be looking to optimize that but again under normal circumstances loss were about 100 MCF but we\u2019ll be looking optimize around that to the best we can.","If talking about Qatar I think the one thing to keep in mind is other than the AKG project, all the rest of the trains are joint ventures, they are not PSEs. So they don\u2019t react the same way that PSEs do. They do all have unique fiscal terms associated with them. But I can tell you as time goes on we don\u2019t see any significant impact on the earnings contribution, anything that would be material. So we continue to remain focused keeping that equipment up and running. We had a terrific year on uptime and reliability and that enabled us to take advantage of some very strong margins at available prices through particularly in the Asia-Pac. So it continues to be a terrific investment for us.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, David. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Hey good morning Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi, I have a couple of questions also, if I may. The first one is on the long life nature of some of your assets. It just kind of occurs to me obviously you haven\u2019t given a reserve replacement number for the year yet but as your portfolio shifts towards the likes of Qatar and the likes of Kashagan and so on Kearl all these are very long life asset. What is the determination internally about the need for reserve replacement to be at or above 100% when you have such huge piece of your portfolio that doesn\u2019t decline on a multi decade basis? And I have got a follow-up, [as I think of] really the capital intensity of the overall portfolio.","David Rosenthal","Yeah let me hit the capital intensity first and I will use that to back into your original question. We have been in a very capital intensive mode in the upstream over the last few years as we recapitalized and invest in a number of these big projects. Some of you mentioned coming out of Qatar and into Kearl, Papua New Guinea LNG, Groningen LNG, the Kashagan of course, you have seen a ramp up in CapEx on these long life projects but as we talked about in the March analyst meeting last year we do have an expectation of rolling that upstream CapEx over a little bit as we go forward and we\u2019ll give you an update on that in March. But we continue to progress that.","In terms of having a target of 100% reserve replacement we don\u2019t really have a target. In other words we\u2019re not going to go out and do things that are not optimal just to achieve 100% replacement target. We basically you know the company and the organization well. We span the world looking for good opportunities, good resources to get access to. And if they are commercial we\u2019ll put the investment capital and human capital in there to development.","We have been fortune over the last many years that the summation of all this effort has achieved 100% or greater than 100% reserves replacement. But I am glad you asked the question because I do want everyone to know that we do not go and spend the shareholders\u2019 money to reach any kind of target like reserves replacement. It\u2019s the outcome of our very disciplined analytical process and again making sure that the CapEx is being spent in those areas, that have the best opportunity to generate long-term value for the shareholder.","And I think last thing I mentioned Doug as we look around the world and you look at our exploration portfolio one of the things that\u2019s really nice today is our ability to be selective amongst that portfolio and pick and choose those opportunities that we want to go after and do the most attractive ones and the reserve adds will be the fall out of that. But thanks for asking question.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","So my follow up there is very quickly is on the Middle East again, as specific to the ADCO concession. I know its fixed margin and relatively low in the grand scheme of things but can you just explain for us what the situation is with that contract. I believe that expired in January 1 and whether or not you have any chance of re-tripping that at some point and I will leave it there, thanks.","David Rosenthal","Yeah the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expired on January 10th of this year. We did have a 9.5% interest in that. That worked out to about 140,000 barrels a day in production. We are no longer in that concession. I will tell you, you mentioned fixed margin contracts, while it was 140,000 barrels of production the unit profitability of that was down at the lower end of our profitable barrels. So that\u2019s the status on the onshore. I really couldn\u2019t comment on any discussions, opportunities forward-looking thoughts other than to kind of give you a status of where we are today.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","All right thanks, David.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning Ed.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Seems real fishing for your slides in March on the production volumes, so why not fish again, just very quickly, the reduction in the West Qurna stake how much did you include longer term in the slide that you put up each year in terms of the new projects for West Qurna?","David Rosenthal","Yeah what I can tell us is we put up that slide in March of every year, and it\u2019s important to know this, we do it on an apples-to-apples basis. So we assume the status quo and the same as prior year prices. So it allows you folks to get a look at what we would be status quo, so no assessments every March in terms of acquisitions, divestments, contract, expiries and all those sort of things.","So last year we would have had an assumption of the status quo in the outlook. Now I can tell you that the way the contracts work we don\u2019t book a lot of barrels in that area. And so the reduction will not be significant I don\u2019t have a specific number for you other than to tell you it won\u2019t be significant in the overall context of our production.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just trying to shift the conversation on can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of oily rig count again in North America, some of your plans obviously the industry has announced some success in the Duvernay, you\u2019ve got some good acreage in Woodford and the core of the Bakken and the Permian, just a quick sort of update on where you are in the oily drilling in North America? Thanks.","David Rosenthal","Sure. As you can tell by the sequential quarter-to-quarter sustained increase in U.S. liquids volumes we have been really orienting our rigs towards the more liquid areas. Biggest places for us, the Bakken, the Permian and the Woodford Ardmore, most all of our rigs are running in those areas. We continue to ramp up.","We\u2019re adding rigs in the Permian for example, both for conventional liquids as well testing some of the unconventional. We are drilling in the Montney and the Duvernay, as you suggested, an increase in the activity there as well as in the Bakken. So if you look at the rigs we\u2019re running today it\u2019s not 100% but it\u2019s probably 85% or so all of our rigs are working in liquids focused plays. And thus you have seen that significant increase in production. We are bringing a lot of wells onto sales every quarter and continue to ramp that up.","We are testing new areas, new zones and in these plays, the Maynard and the Ardmore for example looks very promising to us, we will be getting more wells down there, the Wolfcamp out in the Permian and a number of those plays. So we are very pleased with the acreage we\u2019ve been able to acquire and get into and ramping up pretty dramatically.","And if you look at a number of these things that are occurring over the years, over this year a lot of it gets back to the commentary we made at the Analyst Meeting about working on improving unit profitability. And you do that by limiting or reducing your exposure to low profit barrels, working on fiscal terms where you can and putting your human and financial capabilities in those areas that generate above average incremental profitability and we\u2019ve been executing those efforts this year and we will give you a better update at the March Analyst meeting on the extent of that program.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from to Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey, David. Good morning.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Paul. How are you?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Very good. Sorry, not to beat a dead horse too much. If I look at your last year presentation in the Analyst Meeting on the production profile, can you tell us that for 2014, 2015 roughly how much is building into that particular profile you share from the Kashagan, from the Abu Dhabi, also [onshore] and also on Groningen?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. I don\u2019t have a specific number for Kashagan. Abu Dhabi would have been something in the neighborhood of the 140,000 barrels a day I mentioned and Groningen would have been, whatever the equivalent would have been again for an average year. So I think the important thing to think about is the difference would be kind of what we have mentioned today for both Groningen and the onshore. And again we will be giving you a full update on our outlook that will incorporate those changes and many others that we have heading into 2014 when we get together in March.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Second question. When I am looking at the Imperial in the fourth quarter they report downstream earning of $625 million Canadian dollar. So if you adjust for your working interest and the foreign currency, it would suggest that your share of their downstream earning is above $417 million, meanwhile that your U.S. downstream only report $319 million. Does that mean that outside Canada the rest of your global downstream operation actually loss of a $100 million or that is some different other accounting adjustment that we didn\u2019t avail?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me give you a little perspective on that. First of all as I mentioned a few minutes ago, one of the issues we did see in the quarter was price timing affects about $250 million negative in the U.S. and that impacted those earnings. We do see weakness in our European and Asia Pacific businesses out there, margins are weak, the economy is a bit sluggish.","So both on the refining and the chemical side you are not seeing an earnings contribution there that you would see in an up cycle because we are at \u2013 we are kind of \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before we are at the bottom of the cycle margins. We also had in the fourth quarter a higher turnaround and maintenance load in Europe. Our Antwerp refinery for example had a major turnaround. So you are looking at some volume impacts there. But clearly we are optimizing the European and Asia Pacific footprint as best as we can with the integration between refining, chemicals and lubes. But those are weak markets compared to the U.S and Canada without question.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And I just sneak in one real quick one.","David Rosenthal","Sure.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","For the quarter do you have a cash proceed from asset sales of $1.8 billion. Can you tell us what is the after sales gain in the quarter and breakdown by segment?","David Rosenthal","Sure. If you look at the, first of all the proceeds from asset sales, we had a number of asset sales in the quarter. I mentioned our partial sell down in Iraq and we had a number of sales in the U.S. and in Canada, additional service stations as we continue to progress that effort. We booked a films divestment on the chemicals side. So a number of things contributed to that $1.8 billion.","In terms of an earnings contribution in the fourth quarter that total was about $1 billion all-in, in the quarter across all the businesses. And that compared to about $400 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Dave do you have a breakdown by segment on that $1 billion?","David Rosenthal","Sure. If you look in the upstream right about $775 million in the downstream at about $225 million order of magnitude.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Those are absolute numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Hi, David good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I couldn\u2019t help but ask a question on natural gas here given the recent spike that we have seen. I know the volumes for Exxon have been progressively in decline due to the activity but I am just curious is there a certain pricing level where you may get interested in reengaging in activity and I guess tied in with that I know historically the company doesn\u2019t hedge but with the recent move we\u2019ve seen is that an opportunity to may be lock in some economics and get more active?","David Rosenthal","I will hit the last one first and then back up. No, we don\u2019t hedge oil and gas prices and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change here. So in terms of natural gas pricing you have seen some firming here in the last several weeks. We had a very cold winter in the U.S. and the demand for gas in the power gen and heating has been very strong. And so we\u2019ve seen a fluctuation on the upside for that. But we don\u2019t change our activity levels and investment plans to any significant extent on short term price movements in the commodities. We do have tremendous flexibility in our operations.","I think our drill well inventory here in the U.S. is about 50,000 wells. So we certainly have the capability to move our activity around. But again we don\u2019t typically move dramatically one way or another on a short term price spike or decline. But do acknowledge that we have seen some price uptick here recently.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough. And second question is on Tanzania obviously you had some really good success there and from what I gathered it looks like sufficient resources to probably move forward with the development. So I am curious can you give us an idea of may be timing on potential FID and may be what additional resources you may need to kind of move forward?","David Rosenthal","Sure, first of all it all starts with that resource and we have found a very high quality gas resource out there with the wells that we drilled so far. Like I mentioned earlier 17 to 20 TCF gas in place. I think one of the things that\u2019s encouraging is we still have several more prospects on that block that haven\u2019t been drilled yet. And so we are continuing to drill, we\u2019ll drill some more this year. We\u2019ll be doing some appraisal drilling and some more Wild Cat exploration activity. So that continues to go very well.","In terms of forward planning we are in the early stages of planning for the development of that block, working on things like site selection. You\u2019re probably aware that us and our partner Statoil had worked with BG and Ophir to completing an evaluation of potential sites for our common onshore LNG plant. And we have made a recommendation to the government of Tanzania regarding that.","The next step as you progress would be moving into early feed to kind of see what you have there. But it\u2019s a little too early to be talking about any potential FID date at this time. But clearly, as we always do if you have what looks to be an excellent resource you put the human capital on it and get to thinking about development and optimization and I can assure you that, that process is well underway. We\u2019ll probably be able to get a little better update in March as well on that opportunity but for now I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re moving right along and very pleased with this world class discovery that we\u2019ve made.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, David, just a couple of follow ups, just first on the natural gas point. I fully appreciate Exxon classically does not adjust to the short term price swings. Is it reasonable to think that kind of mid-single digit decline you have had will continue for the next several years or as you assess the XTO and your own resource base between the Marcellus and Woodford and these other areas do you see greater confidence in the class of the resources that the decline rates might be lower or different than what you have done say over the last year and a half?","David Rosenthal","Yeah that\u2019s a multi-part question, both of those can be independent or work together. Certainly we have continued to make good progress in terms of productivity, well rates, down spacing, optimizing our completions and drilling. So we have been able to kind of make the progress we always thought we would when we acquired XTO and combined their folks with our folks and looking at some of these things. So that continues to improve.","It\u2019s hard to give an overall decline curve because as you know that\u2019s \u2013 a lot of time that depends on well work activity and workovers and various other things and a lot of that will be driven by the activity levels, which of course are dependent on longer term price outlooks.","So I think you know from our perspective with the resources there, the opportunities are there, we know all these plays, we know how to produce more gas and when the market needs the gas we\u2019ll provide it. But so it\u2019s a market-driven activity and the outcome in terms of production and reserves and decline will be based on the outcome of those activities as opposed to any target that we might set. But we can adjust quickly. I mean we do have the capability to adjust quickly if the market needs the gas.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. And unrelated follow-up, you mentioned the partial sell-down in West Qurna in Iraq to 25%. I think a few years ago you also bought some acreage in Kurdistan. Can you provide any update in your activities there? I think there had been some questions at least at the time as to whether you could pursue activities in southern Iraq and Kurdistan. So any thoughts on what you are doing in Kurdistan would be helpful?","David Rosenthal","Sure. If you look at the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq I can tell you that we continue to progress all six of the PSE contracts we have there and meet our commitments. Specifically we do have drilling operations underway in one of our blocks. That drilling is ongoing. I don\u2019t have any report out for you yet but those operations are underway and we continue to do seismic and other operations on our other blocks in preparation for drilling there.","So I think in summary across Iraq all of our contracts in the north and the south we continue to meet our commitments and we continue to progress our operations in all of the areas and I am pleased to say that all of them are progressing as per the plan and doing quite well.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you. Good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Hey Asit, how are you?","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good, good. Two quick questions, first on asset sales. It looks like the $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter did not include the portion of Hong Kong Power. Could you update us on the Hong Kong Power sale?","David Rosenthal","Sure. You are right. That $1.8 billion did not include any proceeds from the Hong Kong Power sale. As you are aware we have reached agreements to divest our interest in those facilities. Those approval efforts are ongoing but it\u2019s not closed and it won\u2019t close for a little while but the process is moving along. We would expect to close that deal sometime later this year.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. And the second one is on PNG LNG. It\u2019s very unusual to see a big LNG project coming on ahead of schedule. My question is what sort of volumetric contribution do we expect in Q4 in the ramp-up phase?","David Rosenthal","Yeah I might just add to your comment about how unusual it is to see one of these mega projects stay on schedule. I will also note that we\u2019re still on budget and we\u2019ve not increased the cost outlook on that project since the outlook we gave. So we are ahead of schedule and on budget.","I don\u2019t have a specific volume outlook for you for the fourth quarter. It\u2019s all going to depend on how we get this thing ramped up. But I think, as I mentioned earlier, we have been saying we have first deliveries in the second half and now we moved that up a little more concrete to the third quarter. And as we progress commissioning we will be in a better position here in March to maybe give you a little better update in terms of what to expect. But everything is working well, the drilling, all the commissioning, feeding the gas, the equipment and that\u2019s why we are able to give a more specific target of the third quarter. But we look forward to giving you a better update here in a month or so.","Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citi.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Thank you and good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning Faisal.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Just want to clarify the gain on the asset sale of $1 billion. Is that for the year or for the quarter?","David Rosenthal","Thanks for that follow-up, so that we can be clear. The absolute gain in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and that compares with a gain of about $600 million in the fourth quarter of last year. So we had a change of a positive $400 million.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, understood. And just on exploration expense, it\u2019s sort of been elevated for last three quarters and I understand some of that is coming out of Russia. But can you give us an idea of how these numbers were to trend because you\u2019ve gone from roughly 450 to over 700 a quarter and it seemed to have an outsize effect on some of your expenses? Any sort of clarification or sort of guidance in terms of where that should be would be helpful.","David Rosenthal","Well, the biggest driver of the exploration expense as you note has been our pick-up in activity in Russia and it\u2019s in all areas. So we are talking about all the work that we did this summer in the Kara Sea, the seismic we have been running, the efforts we have in West Siberia as well as across the Black Sea, Northern Black Sea and then over in Russia.","So we have had a lot of exploration activity in support of what is going to be a very robust drilling program this year and next year in a number of these areas. So that is ongoing. It\u2019s nothing that we haven\u2019t planned or expected as we came into this year, and look forward to this year. But I don\u2019t have an outlook in terms of a forward look.","Again that\u2019s one of those areas we will talk a little more about in March. But dry hole expense has been kind of low this past year. So hadn\u2019t been a big contributor to that. So it\u2019s been just a lot of work identifying those drillable prospects and preparing for again an active drilling campaign.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Thank you, David. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning Allen.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","I wondered if you just press you maybe for a bit more detail on the Western Siberia and Tight Oil campaign, whether it be maybe rig counts or planned wells for 2014 and maybe even what you anticipate production exit rate in 2014 might be?","David Rosenthal","Sure, I\u2019ll be happy to give you an update. We\u2019ve got a lot of activity going on, lot of geo technical work, seismic work. As I mentioned in the last quarter call we did have a lot of effort in terms of entering some old well bores and doing some other activity in the fourth quarter of last year. As we head into this year, now\u2019s the time to move on to a drilling program or we would drill some horizontal wells and see how we can get various areas to produce.","One of the things that\u2019s really important for us with the size of our acreage position is to make sure we understand where we are in the play, what are the most prospective areas and that takes a lot of analysis, so you don\u2019t waste a lot of money drilling wells. But we\u2019ve got a lot of expertise in this area that we acquired from XTO. We are bringing that to full bear, along with some of our own technology that we have. And we are looking forward to get some more wells down this year, testing the production capability of some of these areas.","But it would certainly be premature to give any indication or thinking about exit rates or production rates because we\u2019re early on in this analysis. And again it\u2019s very huge resource opportunity in front of us and it certainly behooves us to take our time and go about this in a disciplined manner so that we don\u2019t waste a lot of money while at the same time finding out what this very exciting play is capable of doing and this will be a big year for us.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks for that. And then I know you don\u2019t give guidance on asset sales or what you may see in marketing but earlier this week, I guess one of your peers came out and sort of indicated that he is going to sell a pipeline or an asset here in the U.S. And I was just wondering presumably you are sitting on a lot of mid-stream assets that may unfairly receive the value that they would in a market being incorporated within Exxon given the level of disclosure and the size of your business.","Is there any interest, and I know MLP may be out of question, but any interest in potentially trying to monetize some of these mid-stream assets you have or do you think you just have more value ultimately to operating them and then integrate in your operations as opposed to selling them.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, it\u2019s interesting if you look back over the last couple of years, so 2011 and 2012, we actually did divest a fairly significant chunk of those mid-stream assets that we had, not only in the U.S. but elsewhere. And that was a portion of those large asset sale gains that we had and cash flows in those two years.","I can\u2019t give any specific outlook or asset but as you would expect we are continuously looking at all of our assets, including our midstream assets, what those values are to us internally and what they might be on the market. And we test the market occasionally with some of these. So again they are not sitting there and not getting looked at and evaluated but it\u2019s all part of our program to look at the entire logistics footprint that we have.","And so I mentioned the Edmonton rail facility we\u2019re building so where it\u2019s optimal for us we\u2019ll add mid-stream facilities and where some midstream assets that we have are worth more to somebody else than they are to us we will divest them. Again no specific outlook or assets but we are continuously looking at that entire portfolio.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah, good morning.","David Rosenthal","Hello.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess, just to follow up a little bit on the chemicals business, and there\u2019ve been a few questions on it already, but I just wanted to sort of understand, the changes you saw in the fourth quarter and Exxon wasn\u2019t particularly unique. We definitely saw greater competition out there. But as we look forward in to \u201814 what\u2019s going on in terms of new competition pricing and all that. Kind of let us know how you fall into that or how you, how you would expect \u201814 to unfold on the chemical side.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, as I have on a number of other questions I can\u2019t give an outlook today on any kind of financial parameters for the business. But one of the things we\u2019ve seen recently \u2013 well, first of all we\u2019ll start here in the U.S., we continue to take advantage of a very good market there. Demand has picked up a little bit and of course, gas cracking is also very attractive business for us. And we have been fortunate in that we\u2019ve been able to run our facilities along the Gulf Coast flat out here over the last quarter and therefore make the production we need to meet the market demand.","And so those margins in the U.S. remain healthy, demand pick up a little bit, export opportunities also very attractive, and we\u2019re maximizing all that. On the other side of the planet margins continue to be quite weak in the Asia Pacific area. We did have some capacity come on last year. And it\u2019s typical in our business there\u2019s never a perfect match between capacity additions and demand growth.","Demand growth tends to be out there for a while and then people put on the facilities and they tend to come in on in chunks and for a while you\u2019ll have supply outstripping demand. And we\u2019ve seen that in a number of areas, a number of products particularly in the Asia-Pac area. Those have a tendency to balance themselves out over time. We are also seeing some demand pick up in China and the rest of the Asia-Pac area and that is helpful.","I mentioned the specialties business. We have seen some weakness there, particularly in Europe, again both from the economic situation there as well as additional industry capacity that\u2019s come on. So I\u2019d characterize it as kind of normal cyclical business for the chemical industry across many years. You have got the U.S., at kind of top of the cycle, business conditions today in Europe and Asia-Pac kind of at the bottom of the cycle.","And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve over time invested in each of these places where we can bring some technology or get a feed slate advantage or a logistics advantage in order to be able to supply all of those regions through the business cycle. But most importantly be able to take advantage when you get an upside and we are certainly well positioned to do that with our facilities.","Combine that with the level of integration we have and if you look overall it is kind of a tough market but we did make almost $4 billion this year in that business and that\u2019s pretty strong performance.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Fully agreed, thanks. And then the unrelated question, you mentioned in the press release about LNG for Alaska. I was just curious is there anything you can do to help us understand more conventional business North Slope, Prudhoe in Alaska, you had the tax change that the government put through up there. We\u2019ve seen some indications that the other participants in Alaska are getting a little more active.","Just wondered is, how does Exxon participate in that? Is it basically along with the others? So maybe there is a little bit of growth coming from Alaska in the near future. Or if it\u2019s you are waiting for something larger like the more offshore drilling that looks like it continues to slip out to the future?","David Rosenthal","What we have seen across the business up there is pretty much what you would expect. Lower taxes have led to folks to take another look at their investment opportunities. And investments that were not viable under the old regime could very well be viable under the new regime. So you have seen some activity up there.","As you know we are a large participant owner in Prudhoe Bay. We are not the operator but any of the growth that you see there in some of the projects and activity increase that you have seen announced and underway in Prudhoe Bay, up on the North Slope, we would participate in. And so obviously everybody up there is looking at that and it\u2019s still a very key resource for us. And as opportunities become attractive, of course with our partners we would be willing to invest in that. So I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward on the North Slope.","If you look at the Alaska LNG opportunity for us, as you know, it\u2019s one of many opportunities we are looking at across the globe for LNG. We did, as you read in the press, have heads of agreement here recently, another very positive milestone. It sets guiding principles, terms and conditions to progress the work on the project and so we are continuing to progress that.","We have, after a long evaluation process looking at locations, we have identified an industrial site near Nikiski as a lead site for the potential plant and terminal. We are looking at other sites. But I think the message is, that\u2019s potentially a very large, very complex project. And so all of the stakeholders are progressing, the analysis and looking at that project in due course and we of course are a big part of that.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hi, good morning. I see you have finalized the Canadian rail terminal project plans. Can you tell us what the total CapEx will be for that 230,000 railway facility? And then how you think about it more strategically? I know at least to me Exxon seems more like a vertical integration player where you see an opportunity in your downstream and you set up a midstream opportunity here, that you really integrate. But others seem to be using rail as more of an optionality.","So if the spreads get to a certain distance and other transport routes are not available you use them kind of opportunistically. So can you tell me how you are thinking about the expected utilization rates at that facility, is it more of a base run you are at 100% or you are leaving it out there as an option?","David Rosenthal","Yeah. I think, let me hit the first part of your question first. We would expect the all-in capital cost for that JV to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million to $250 million and that\u2019s a 50-50 joint venture. So we have got about half of that.","You know the terminal we will have, the max capacity could be upwards of 250,000 barrels a day. Out of that we\u2019re looking at utilizing initially about 100,000 barrels a day to move our expanded production into the market. With the growing production of Western Canadian crudes so both heavy crudes and oil sands it\u2019s prudent to be working at all of the logistics opportunities so that you do get a lot of optionality as you mentioned, but also the flexibility to be able to better pinpoint the destination of some of your crudes as various regional opportunities present themselves.","So we\u2019re taking full advantage of all the pipeline opportunities that are out there and working on that. Other modes of transportation by water are also being utilized. And then again as is prudent we\u2019re looking at the railcar option. So it\u2019s all about optionality, flexibility and being able to take advantage of spreads and opportunities to maximize the overall value and we have been working on that for quite a while.","The other thing you have in the flexibility on the transportation piece is it really helps us on both the integration with our own refining circuit as well as have any opportunity and viability to make third-party sales. And so the more options you have the more flexibility you have, the better off you are to divert production to areas different than what you might have originally planned. So we\u2019re taking all of that into consideration.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey guys. Well just one from me and this is a high level question. On the day that the Senate Energy Committee is debating crude oil export policy I know that Exxon\u2019s perspective on this is kind of we closely watch. So any thoughts on the issue and where the company stands?","David Rosenthal","Sure. I would be happy to talk about that. It\u2019s a topical subject. First of all our response is principal-based as you would probably guess. And as a company we fully support free markets, free trade. We oppose any barriers or restrictions to free trade and open investment across the value chain in the energy sector. And over time I think it\u2019s pretty clear that barriers to free trade can actually lead to higher prices, dampen economic growth and prosperity and in this case could potentially harm energy security by limiting diversity of supplies.","So trade is good, free trade is the best way to maximize the economic value of any enterprise including the oil and gas enterprise, generates the most jobs, generates the most revenue to the taxing authorities. And so across the business that\u2019s what we support and we would not advocate putting any restrictions at any point along a manufacturing value chain even if it might benefit some part of our business.","In addition to crude oil we strongly support unrestricted LNG exports, even though we are a very large petrochemical company and consume a lot of petrochemical feed stock. So the bottom line big supporters of free markets and free trade, level playing field for all competitors and then let the market do what it does best.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from [Viraj Kataria] with RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, David thanks for taking my question, I have two, if I may. Especially on LNG you touched on it a couple of times in the call. I wondered if you could talk through your options to expanding this growth area outside of Tanzania and PNG. And secondly I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your thought process when setting dividends. You obviously have a very strong balance sheet and the highest returns in the industry and you could afford a significantly higher dividend. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.","David Rosenthal","Sure. Let me start with LNG because we\u2019re very pleased to have a broad opportunity set in front of us. In addition to Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tanzania, as you mentioned we have a very attractive opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we already have a very large re-gas facility. So a lot of that investment is already on the ground. And we have an opportunity to add liquefaction capacity there. And one of the things that makes our project unique is we also have re-gas capacity available in Europe from some investments that we made in prior years.","So we have the opportunity to simply add liquefaction capacity on the front-end and then export that LNG, take advantage of a number of opportunities, not least of which is capacity, we have to regasify in Europe. We have received a permit for free trade agreement countries and we have had a permanent application in for some time for non-free trade agreements and that continues to be a nice opportunity.","We also are looking at the possibility of viability of LNG exports out of British Colombia and Canada. We have a very large resource base in western Canada of natural gas and we do have efforts underway and are progressing. In fact we just received a permit approval for a potential up to 30 MTA facility in western Canada and we\u2019re working on site selection and other things there.","Then of course Alaska which we just mentioned a minute ago. Huge resource, great opportunity but again like the other projects very high capital cost, very complex. It will be extremely important to have attractive stable fiscal terms, as it is in any area but that\u2019s also an opportunity for us.","So again it\u2019s all about having a broad balanced portfolio of opportunities, so that you can select those that are the most attractive. But you don\u2019t find yourself in a position where you have to do something that\u2019s not attractive and our LNG opportunity set certainly fits that case.","In terms of dividends you know we have been pretty briskly increasingly the dividend over the last few years. We had a fairly significant dividend increase. I think it\u2019s about 20% or so in 2012, another 11% increase this past year and it extends a very long period of time that we have been increasing dividend so I think we have been responsive in that area.","In terms of going forward I wouldn\u2019t expect any change to our overall philosophy with regards to the dividend. We do expect to pay a consistent dividend that grows overtime and obviously we are able to do that given the strong cash flows the business generates, our strong financial capacity. So don\u2019t have any outlook or guidance or anything other than to say that I would expect our philosophy going forward to be the same as it has been historically.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","Thank you very much.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rosenthal I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David Rosenthal","Okay I simply like to thank everybody for their participation on the call. I appreciate your questions today, very important to our business and look forward to seeing everyone here in a few weeks at the Analyst Meeting in March. So thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David S. Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.","Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth remained weak in the fourth quarter, driven by the U.S., Japan and Europe. Preliminary fourth quarter U.S. GDP showed a slight decline of 0.1%. The Japanese and European economies remain challenged, with Japan experiencing its second recession in 3 years, and Europe likely marginally positive. Meanwhile, China's growth rate showed some improvement, reflecting an upturn in industrial production and higher retail sales. Energy markets were mixed in the fourth quarter, with higher U.S. natural gas prices and relatively flat Brent crude oil prices, while WTI's prices declined. European and Asian chemical margins showed improvement. However, global industry refining margins deteriorated significantly versus the third quarter.","Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings were just under $10 billion, an increase of $550 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share for the quarter were $2.20, up $0.23 from a year ago. The corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was used to repurchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2013. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $12.4 billion, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the Denbury transaction. Our cash generation remains strong with $14 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the fourth quarter 2012, cash totaled $9.9 billion and debt was $11.6 billion.","The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $13.3 billion to $9.9 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, up $10.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.6 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased our cash by $300 million.","Moving now to the full year results as shown on Slide 6, ExxonMobil's full year 2012 earnings were $44.9 billion, up $3.8 billion from 2011. Earnings per share for the year were $9.70, up $1.28 from 2011. The corporation distributed $30.1 billion to shareholders in 2012 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $20 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2012 was $39.8 billion, up $3 billion from 2011, primarily due to continued progress on our world-class project portfolio, including the Kearl oil sands project. Included in full year CapEx was about $3 billion of acquisitions. Our cash generation was very strong with $63.8 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $7.7 billion associated with the asset sales.","Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 7. During the year, cash decreased from $13.1 billion to $9.9 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $63.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to PP&E of $34.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $30.1 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.6 billion.","Moving on to Slide 8 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings of just under $10 billion increased $550 million or 6% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher refining and chemical margins, partially offset by lower production volumes and lower gains on asset sales. Upstream earnings decreased $1.1 billion while Downstream earnings improved by $1.3 billion. Chemical earnings were up $415 million and corporate and financing expenses increased by $141 million, primarily due to tax items. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.","As shown on Slide 9, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings increased by $380 million compared with the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher production volumes and gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower refining margins.","Looking now at the full year comparison on Slide 10, ExxonMobil's full year 2012 earnings were up $3.8 billion to $44.9 billion, an increase of 9% from 2011, primarily due to divestment and restructuring gains and higher refining margins, partially offset by lower production volumes. Upstream earnings decreased $4.5 billion while Downstream earnings were up $8.7 billion and Chemical earnings were down $485 million. Corporate and financing expenses for the full year 2012 were down a favorable $118 million from 2011.","Moving next to fourth quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 11. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high-quality upstream projects. At the end of the fourth quarter, construction of the Kearl Initial Development was complete and we are currently progressing phased start-up activities. Mining operations have commenced and ore is being stockpiled adjacent to the ore processing plant, which is being commissioned. Commissioning of the utility systems is well advanced, with 2 boilers operational. The ore preparation plant crusher and slurry preparation conveyors also began running in December. The bitumen process facilities are being readied for the introduction of solvent, and the diluent and natural gas supply systems are operational. We expect production of mine-diluted bitumen from the first of 3 frac treatment trains in the first quarter. Startup of the 2 additional bitumen frac treatment trains will proceed in sequence as planned, with production from the initial development expected to reach volumes of approximately 110,000 barrels per day of bitumen later in 2013. Despite U.S. permitting the regulatory issues that continued for almost 2 years involving transportation of facility modules, our project team achieved industry-leading safety performance and mitigated significant challenges, including an early onset of winter and exceptionally harsh weather during the current start-up operations. Our priority remains to complete these activities safely.","Also during the quarter, we announced our plans to develop the Hebron oilfield offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. The development, we utilized a gravity-based structure designed to withstand a variety of harsh Arctic conditions, including sea ice and icebergs. The base, which is already under construction, has been designed to store approximately 1.2 million barrels of crude oil and will support an integrated topsides deck that includes living quarters and facilities to perform drilling and production operations. Oil recovery from the project is currently estimated at 700 million barrels with upside potential. The platform is designed for production of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is anticipated around the end of 2017.","And finally, the Angola Satellites Phase 2 project was sanctioned during the quarter. The development continues to optimize the capabilities of the existing Block 15 facilities and will allow current production levels to be increased via subsea tiebacks to our existing FPSOs.","Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our conventional exploration activities. In Tanzania, the Lavani-2 well successfully appraised the Lavani-1 Palaeogene discovery. Additionally, a new discovery of gas in a high-quality Cretaceous reservoir was encountered. This reservoir is of similar age to the Zafarani discovery and marked the third discovery on Block 2 in 2012. The Zafarani-2 appraisal well spud in December. Additional 3D seismic acquisition and processing is also underway and is expected to be available for analysis in the first quarter of 2013.","Also during the quarter, ExxonMobil secured the right to farm in to a 75% operating interest in the Tugela South Exploration Right, which covers approximately 2.8 million acres offshore Durban on the East Coast of South Africa. Separately, we executed a technical cooperation permit with the government of South Africa to study the hydrocarbon potential of the Deepwater Durban Basin, covering approximately 12.4 million acres.","In the Gulf of Mexico, the Phobos prospect, which is 5 miles South of ExxonMobil's Hadrian South discovery, spud during the quarter. Additionally, we have plans for an active exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico during 2013.","Turning now to our unconventional exploration activities on Slide 13. In the middle of Magdalena Basin of Colombia, we drilled the Mono Arana 1 well targeting tight oil in the La Luna shale formation. This well will be tested during the first quarter of 2013. In Argentina, we have completed the drilling of 4 wells on the Loma del Molle, Los Toldos I and Los Toldos II blocks with encouraging results. Completions and testing are now underway. Two additional wells on the Sierra charter [ph] and Pampa de las Yeguas blocks are currently drilling. In Russia, Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed a Pilot Development Agreement establishing a joint project to assess the commercial production of tight oil reserves at the Bazhenov and Achimov formations in West Siberia. The joint venture is 51% Rosneft and 49% ExxonMobil. Work will be carried out on Rosneft's 23 licensed blocks, covering a total of more than 10,000 square kilometers. Drilling is anticipated to begin in 2013.","Also, during the quarter, we closed on the Denbury transaction, which increased our holdings in the Bakken region by about 50% to approximately 600,000 net acres, giving the company a more significant presence in one of the major U.S. growth areas for onshore oil production.","Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 14. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $7.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011. Lower crude oil realizations, mostly offset by improved natural gas realizations, negatively impacted earnings by $70 million, as crude oil realizations declined $3.18 per barrel and gas realizations increased $0.21 per thousand cubic feet. Production volume and mix effects negatively impacted earnings by $400 million. All other items, primarily lower gains from asset sales, decreased earnings by $600 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $19.65.","Moving to Slide 15, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 5.2% from the fourth quarter of last year due to the impact of base decline, lower entitlement volumes and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in West Africa and higher demand. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 2.1%.","Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on Slide 16. Upstream earnings increased by $1.8 billion versus the third quarter of 2012. Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million, primarily due to lower crude oil realizations, which declined $0.66 per barrel but were mostly offset by improved natural gas realizations, which increased $0.72 per thousand cubic feet. Production volume and mix effects increased earnings by $660 million. Other items, including higher gains from asset sales and favorable tax items, increased earnings by $1.2 billion.","Moving to Slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes were up 8.4% from the third quarter of 2012, mainly due to higher seasonal demand in Europe and lower downtime, partly offset by base decline. Entitlement volumes were positive due to favorable price and spend impacts in several regions.","Turning now to the full year comparison and starting on Slide 18. Upstream earnings were $29.9 billion in 2012, a decrease of $4.5 billion from 2011. Lower crude oil realizations, primarily in the U.S., partly offset by improved natural gas realizations, led to a negative impact of $110 million. Lower volume and mix impacts decreased earnings by $2.3 billion. All other items, including higher operating expenses, unfavorable tax items, lower gains on asset sales and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by a total of $2.1 billion.","Moving to Slide 19. Full year volumes declined by 5.9% or 267,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2011. Lower volumes were primarily driven by base decline, lower entitlement volumes and divestments, partly offset by project ramp-up in West Africa and lower downtime. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was down 1.7%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.","On Slide 20, we show actual 2012 production volumes compared to the outlook provided at the March Analyst Meeting. Overall, actual 2012 volumes were 2.7% lower than this outlook. About 1\/2 of this variance was due to operational performance, with the balance due mainly to entitlement and Iraq spend impacts. Operational performance for the year was slightly below forecast, reflecting the timing of work program execution and the duration of downtime events, particularly in the U.K. North Sea. While the 2012 Brent crude price of about $112 per barrel is near the basis of our March Analyst Meeting outlook, prices in the first half of 2012, most notably February through April, were higher than our outlook basis, which negatively affected volumes due to the timing of both permanent and price-related impacts. The efficient use of capital in Iraq resulted in lower spending, which also lowered net volumes.","Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 21. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011. Improved margins, mainly in North American refining, increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to increased capture of advantaged North American crude supply. All other items increased earnings by a net $80 million.","Turning to Slide 22. Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings declined by $1.4 billion. Lower refining margins decreased earnings by $1.4 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $260 million, mainly driven by optimization and yield improvements. Other items reduced earnings by $270 million, primarily due to the absence of the gain on the Switzerland divestment.","The full year comparison for the Downstream is shown on Slide 23. Downstream full year 2012 earnings were $13.2 billion, up $8.7 billion from 2011. Higher margins, mainly in North American and European refining, increased earnings by $2.6 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $180 million as refining optimization activities, including increased capture of advantaged North American crude supplies, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activity and lower contributions from divested assets. Other effects increased earnings by $5.9 billion, mainly due to the restructuring of our Downstream holdings in Japan.","Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 24. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $958 million, up $415 million versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger margins increased earnings by $330 million, mainly reflecting higher aromatics realizations and improved light feed advantage. All other items increased earnings by $90 million.","Moving to Slide 25. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings increased by $168 million. Stronger margins, mainly due to improved aromatics realizations and improved light feed advantage, increased earnings by $180 million. All other items decreased earnings by $10 million.","On Slide 26, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2012 earnings were nearly $3.9 billion. Weaker margins, mainly in Europe and Asia, decreased earnings by $440 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $100 million. Other effects increased earnings by $50 million due to the Japan restructuring, partly offset by a number of items, including unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","Moving to Slide 27. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year financial and operating performance reflect the value of our integrated business model and other competitive advantages. In the fourth quarter, we earned just under $10 billion, generated $14 billion in cash flow, invested $12.4 billion in the business and distributed $7.6 billion to our shareholders. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.","And finally, I would like to mention 2 upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2012 reserves replacement data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our Analyst Meeting this year will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 6. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson. That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question on production is for Kearl, is that weather the driver in the short-term delay in the production ramp? And should we be considering a 3-quarter ramp-up to 110,000 barrels a day, I guess, exiting the year at that capacity? And then I have a second question, please.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, the weather situation was a major factor in the startup, moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year to the first quarter. We had 2 things actually. One, weather came earlier than normal and then it has been just brutally cold up there, and so we've had to adjust accordingly. As we move through the quarter and continue progressing some of the activities I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect, as that first frac treatment process comes up, that'll give us about 37,000 barrels of bitumen a day, and then we'll bring up the next 2 frac treatment trains kind of in sequence, and that'll get us up to 110,000. I don't have a specific date for achieving the 110,000 but it'll be later in the year as a function of progress that we make here across the winter, getting things started up safely. So the focus is getting the project up and running, getting that first production online and then moving forward and getting up to the full capacity that we've mentioned. And we are making really good progress this quarter, but again, it's a deliberate, diligent effort to get this thing up safely, recognizing that this is a multi-decade project and we really want to focus on getting it up right.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And my second question, it really relates to the use of rail for oil movement in North America. And I know that Exxon has a large existing railcar fleet, a diversified and growing liquid footprint. I also read a report recently that Exxon's placed a significant railcar order recently. And so I just wondering do you see rail as a potential solution for taking [ph] barrel production in the event maybe the Keystone is delayed or denied, or if you have other kind of specified or a contemplated use for rail as a bit more permanent solution for oil movement in North America.","David S. Rosenthal","That's an all-encompassing question, so I'll probably step back here for just a second and put it in perspective. First of all, with relation -- or with regard to the Kearl project, we have worked all of the logistics out and we can place all of our barrels and we have the capability to run all those barrels in our own refineries for that first 110,000 barrels a day. We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but we do not have an issue in terms of logistics, moving those barrels out of the Kearl project and into the market. As you look a little more broadly, both at the Canadian heavy crude as well as a lot of the crudes such as Bakken, until pipelines are built and some of the things that you mentioned actually come to fruition, there are, today, some bottlenecks across the industry and there's a lot of different modes of transportation being used to move that product to market, of which railcar is certainly one of them, waiting for some of these pipelines to come in. As you mentioned, we have -- or as you would expect with the size of our business, we have a very large fleet of rail cars, both across all of our businesses, and so that is already a primary mode of transportation for us. We're always looking at that. We're always looking at the logistics and how we can optimize both the placement of our production into the market as well as obtaining advantaged feedstocks for our refining circuit. And so that is an ongoing effort, and there's nothing unusual in that. In regards to the rumor that you heard, I would just say that's a rumor. I wouldn't have a comment on it specifically, but I can say there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of what our organization, our supply organization is working on, again, getting our crudes to market for the best value and getting the lowest cost advantaged feedstocks into our refineries and chemical plants.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple, so I'll try and be fairly quick on these. But can I deal first with the capture rate? We used to look at this quite a lot, I guess, it's now become a bit of an issue again. I'm talking about the net income as a proportion of your weighted realizations. The last -- not just in this quarter, but the last 2 or 3 quarters, it looks like it's been sliding a little bit, and I'm just wondering if there's a particular trend that you can observe there or for something that you're seeing as well, what might be behind that? And then I have a quick follow-up, please.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. That -- yes, I know the trend you're talking about over the last couple of quarters. Of course, there's a lot of things working in there, some of the price differentials that you're seeing, some of the mix effects of where our production's coming from, some of the entitlement effects that you see there. And again, U.S. gas production and that sort of thing. So I wouldn't read anything into a couple of quarters' worth of data. We are very focused on unit profitability and working that very hard, getting some of these projects up. We have seen some increased operating expense as we brought some of these new projects up. But again, I think if you look over the longer trend and you look at the projects we've got coming on, I think that'll sort itself out, but a lot of ups and downs across the year here.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I'll keep an eye on that one. The other one is really, I know you're not going to give me a great answer on this, at least I'm presuming, so buybacks and dividends, David, there's some chatter in the market that the sustainability of your buybacks may not be -- it might not be realistic to assume $5 billion on a quarterly basis. But you have still got very, very low net debt to cap. So I'm just curious about how management is thinking about where the balance sheet [ph] ought to be for a company given the level of your capital spending and what the priorities would be potentially for, again, for the [indiscernible]?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're looking at another $5 billion of buybacks for the quarter. I don't have any guidance going forward, that'll be -- depend on a number of things, including commodity prices and margins. In terms of the balance sheet structure and use of debt in our cash flows, Doug, I -- there's really no change in what we've been doing for a very long time, which is making sure we pay a consistent increasing dividend over time. We fund that very robust capital program that we have and get these projects -- as you know, we have very large projects starting up between now and the end of 2016, getting all that funded, as well as our pipeline of portfolio projects. And then the balance of the cash, we return to the shareholders via the buyback. In terms of target leverage or any of that sort of thing, I really wouldn't have a comment on that other than we do have an objective of maintaining a very strong balance sheet, keeping that flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. And so although there's wide variability in prices and margins as we go through the cycles in the business, those constants will remain just that. And we really don't -- really wouldn't have any change that I could foresee coming.","Operator","We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I just was going to keep this on the actual earnings, but one question for 2013. Obviously, you've made some small acquisitions, you've Denbury and obviously Celtic. If you can just run us through what volumes you expect in '13 and when you expect, I think, the Celtic deal to close.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. Let me hit the second one first, and then I'll come back to the other one. I really wouldn't give any outlook comments on Celtic. That transaction has not closed yet. We're still in the review process. So making any comment about that probably would not be appropriate. If we go back to the Denbury deal that we did close in the fourth quarter, we did pick up, as I mentioned, a couple of hundred thousand acres there. I don't have an outlook for you, but in terms of what we'll do as we go forward, I can tell you that we did see in our own business in the Bakken gross operating production of about 33,000 barrels a day this year, and that was up just over 50% from last year, and that excludes a little bit of a contribution from the Denbury acquisition there at the end of the year. I will say that this acreage that we're picking up is in the high-performing middle Bakken and upper Three Forks area. It's also pretty adjacent to the properties we already had, so we get some good synergy and leverage there. So without giving a specific outlook on the volumes from that, we are certainly looking forward to folding that into our portfolio, optimizing the production out of that and really putting together, as we always do, a long-term forward plan for developing that resource. So we're pretty excited about it, but we just got it and we're just getting to work on it.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just in the quarter you had, I mean, European gas, I mean is it -- was demand weak or was it declined? And then on Africa, you fell a bit in Q4 versus Q3, and I'm just wondering, was that anything unusual?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. If you look at -- so let's take Europe first. It's really decline, just normal decline, nothing out of the ordinary there. We did see -- we also had a little bit of -- if you're looking, say, year-over-year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we did have some asset management impacts as well. So think about it as a little uptick in demand, offset by normal decline and the impact of the assets that we divested.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then Africa oil fell Q-over-Q and obviously, year-over-year?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. If I'm looking at the Africa liquids, I think we're actually up a little bit in the fourth quarter of '12 versus '11. But sequentially, yes. We began -- yes, if you're looking sequentially, that's really just a planned downtime event. We actually had a little increase in pricing spend, entitlement impacts, but it was really maintenance and downtime.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","If I could just follow up on the European gas volume comment, even if I adjust for the portfolio effects, I estimate you're still down maybe 5% year-on-year and I'm wondering what -- one, is that a good adjusted number, where would you point me there? And then secondly, how much of the decline might you attribute to loss with increased competition, with say, coal imports into Europe, which appear to have been quite robust kind of midyear into year end? And then how much of that might reverse in the first quarter would you estimate?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes. Let's take those -- probably best to look at that on a full year over full year. Although the quarter, I think, could be -- would be pretty similar. If we look year-over-year in total, we did see a little uptick in demand on a net basis, and we actually had a little better performance in our operations from a downtime perspective. So that was offset, if you look at the total year-over-year demand, really, by decline and asset management impacts. In terms of competition from coal or that sort of thing, I don't think that's a big impact. I know there's been some switching around up there, but I think for our perspective, overall -- again, our demand was a little higher, we're just seeing the impact of normal decline in the asset management from the assets we divested, primarily in the fourth quarter of last year.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Downstream, it sounds like you referenced a better capture on the light end of the barrel feeding into your refineries. Can you give us some more color around that? Are you running more light crude oil in North America as a percentage of the overall feedstock? And are you getting a better price relative to benchmarks in the applicable regions, let's say, LOS [ph] along the Gulf Coast, and any kind of incremental color in terms of earnings contribution on the margin or extra volumes you're running?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, sure. Let me give you just a little bit of data coming right out of the earnings, Rex [ph], that we talked about. If you look at our fourth quarter '12 over fourth quarter '11 earnings, there's a volume mix effect there that nets to $80 million. I can tell you within that is about $300 million positive on our optimization of our refining circuit. And a big piece of that is going to be higher advantage crude processing, both heavy crudes into a number of our refineries as well as an increased light feed slate along the Gulf Coast. Now that was offset by a number of things, including assets that we no longer own. But likewise, even if you look on the sequential earnings, where you see that volume mix effect of a positive $260 million, embedded in that is about $400 million of total refining optimization effects, also including the slate that we're running in, particularly in the light feeds as well as getting some more of the heavy feeds in. So without being real specific in terms of numbers, we are benefiting greatly. And it's not just -- I think one thing that we ought to be clear on understanding is it's not just the optimization of the feed slate into the refineries to produce clean products, it's also the benefit we get from the integration with chemicals and lube, so we're optimizing the products that come out as well across a broader slate. So when we're looking at optimizing the total circuit, it's across all of the business units. And that's where we probably get an advantage that others who don't have this level of integration, just aren't able to get. And so some of that shows up in the other places as well. I can give you one just number that'd probably help a little bit. As we look at just our U.S. Gulf Coast refining circuit, we have more than triple the processing of advantaged North American crude over the last couple of years. So again, without giving a KBD or a percentage basis, you can get a feel for the kind of impact that we're having.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the ratio at least. Now that you've tripled and we're set to get a bunch more pipe to come online to the coastal markets here in short order, can you give some order of magnitude of how much further you could go as far as a ratio, again assuming the price would justify it in the linear programming model?","David S. Rosenthal","I wouldn't want to give a specific number there for commercial reasons, other than to say we are working on that and tweaking things a little bit so that we can continue to pursue the opportunities to do that and get a little more flexibility. One of the things I'll mention, another statistic that I think folks lose sight of a little bit just because of our size is when you look at our 5, what we call, Mid-Continent refineries, so you're talking about the Rockies and then up into Canada, we've got about 600,000 barrels a day of \"Mid-Con,\" if you will, refining capacity. And while that's not a big percentage of our total worldwide capacity, when you look at it compared to others in the industry in the U.S., it is a sizable component of our capacity. So again, if you're thinking about heavy feeds in the refineries, if you're looking at light feeds into the circuit from the Gulf Coast all the way up into Canada, we are optimizing that entire circuit. And again, that's across refining chemicals and lubes, and you're seeing that in our margins both in the Chemical business and in the Refining business.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Gammel of Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","David, I was hoping that I might be able to get some more granularity on the comment on Slide 12 that talks about the active exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico in 2013, either in terms of number of rigs employed, number of wells planned or better yet, specific prospects you're planning to drill. And then if you could provide similar information on the global deepwater program.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let's start with the Gulf of Mexico, and it's really a number of things from drilling wells to processing seismic to capturing additional opportunity. I could give you a couple of well examples. The Phobos well has spud. We're participating in the Thorn well next. So a couple of wells there. We're also -- as you know, we have a very large portfolio and we're running a lot of seismic activity both on the imaging side as well as the processing and analysis, so a lot going on. I think, in terms of the specifics and kind of some of the numbers, I'll hold off and we'll discuss that in our Analyst Meeting and give you a little more granularity and coverage on that. If you look globally, we've got a number of things going on, building on success from last year. As you know, we had the discoveries in Tanzania, very successful there, and a lot more work going on there. We also -- we followed up on the success we had in Romania, in the northern Black Sea as an example. So it's really a nice pipeline. We're doing appraisal and work on Hadrian and looking at the project there, so that's kind of at the front end of the curve. Some other wells going down, building on some successes and then the pipeline of opportunities coming in, a couple of those I mentioned in my remarks. So we do intend to give you a really good fulsome update on our deepwater program in the Analyst Meeting, and so I probably don't want to get too far out ahead of that. In addition, and I think equally exciting is, we have a number of unconventional wells that are liquids-oriented that we'll be doing this year. Of course, I mentioned Western Siberia with Rosneft. We have a lot of activity going on in Colombia, continuing to work in Argentina. So probably as balanced a portfolio as we've had in a long time as we head into 2013. And again, building on last year's success and starting to drill a lot of these opportunities that we've acquired over the last few years.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that helps, and I look forward to the Analyst Meeting. As my second question, David, this is probably going to be fruitless, but you do reference on Slide 20 that Iraq spend had negative effects on the 2012 production volumes relative to the outlook. If that Iraq spend number went to 0, would you be able to provide what type of impact it would have on your production guidance?","David S. Rosenthal","No, I really don't have that number and wouldn't want to speculate on that. I think if you look at what we were able to do in this past year in Iraq, it's really meet our commitments, get the production up, spend a lot less money, all of that's good. It just -- as you know how the contracts work there, that meant that we got fewer barrels, but I wouldn't want to speculate on what a number might be if the spend went to 0.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Terreson with ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question about the Downstream. Your OECD product sales posted a positive comparison for the first time in a while, meaning North America and Europe, Canada. So my question is whether or not you guys are seeing better trends in some of these developed countries or whether company-specific factors might be driving the improved results, specifically a minute ago, you mentioned that you're running a lot more North American crudes and yields might be better. But anyway, I just wanted to see if you could try and reconcile that.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me start with the U.S. because that's probably the best indicator of what we're seeing. You do see a bit more of, I mentioned, the optimization that we're getting out of running some of the feeds, but I think the biggest part and the one that we're really pleased with is we're seeing some good business growth out of our new model and our new footprint. We've been spending the last few years transitioning from a company-owned retail market -- or a retail business rather -- into a dealer and distributor market. And so you might think we'll -- we'd lose all those volumes. But what we've seen, in fact, is we've kept a lot of those volumes and then the B2B business has picked up for us. So again, we're pleased with the ability. Again, it all gets back to this integrated business model and integrated business teams looking at the new footprint that we have on the retail side and finding ways to profitably move the barrels into the market that we used to run through our own and operated stores. So that's really the big driver there.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also you mentioned in the presentation just a few minutes ago, 2 of the more high potential, unconventional oil development areas, which being Argentina and Russia, and so I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more specificity on what Exxon plans to accomplish in the joint venture with Rosneft and also in Argentina in 2013, meaning, given the pace of activity that you highlighted, it seems like you may be able to frame an outlook in Argentina sooner. But just wanted to see if you had more specifics on the next steps in those 2 countries this year.","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. Let me start with Russia and then back up into Argentina. So if you're looking at Western Siberia, in particular, in that unconventional area, the plan for 2013 is really to take this agreement that we've signed and really start looking at testing, analyzing what's there. And of course, on all these unconventional plays, it's not a question of is there something down there, it's a question of can you make it commercial. And you've seen around the world, some of these have been commercial early and some have not been commercial. So the most important first step in Western Siberia tight oil is to see what's there, apply some technology and see if that's going to be commercial. And that's what we'll be doing this year jointly with Rosneft. Of course, the great thing about Western Siberia is you have an opportunity to leverage the expertise we've developed and are applying here in the U.S. and we've applied elsewhere in other countries -- we're currently doing it in Argentina and Colombia -- and take that into Western Siberia, marry it up with Rosneft's operating capabilities and all of the assets that they have on the ground, and see if we can fairly quickly ascertain what's there in the commercial viability. I mentioned there's, I think, 10,000 square kilometers over 23 blocks. So defining where the best spots are quickly will also be very key so that we don't spend too much time and money drilling in areas that don't have the best prospectivity. It's still early days in Argentina. I mentioned that we do have these 4 wells down and we're very happy to have that and we're looking at those. We've got 800,000 acres down there and we know it spans all of the windows from dry gas to mixed gas and liquids to tight oil. And so the real objective of the exploration effort is to figure out what we've got, where it is, can it be commercially produced and then after that, how you might develop that resource and get those products to market. As we look into 2013 in Argentina, we're going to continue evaluating and testing the wells that we drilled and got down last year. I'll tell you that we have another well that was drilling at year end that we'll get done in the first quarter and get to work testing that this year. And then we have the 6-well, I mentioned, that spud in December. And then we've got 4 additional wells coming this year. So these will be our first operated wells in a number of areas. So when we get done this year, although we'll barely scratch the surface of 800,000 acres, we should have a pretty good idea of what we got with the way we've got these wells spread out.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David, you don't consider infrastructure constraints to be meaningful in either country where you guys are operating?","David S. Rosenthal","Not at this point in time. We've got plenty of assets on the ground that we're deploying, and so we don't see that as an issue, again, in this exploration and evaluation and assessment phase that we're in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Going back on production, just looking at it from a high level, you're talking about falling about 6% year-on-year, but gas is down substantially more than that, particularly in Asia. You've talked about European issues, but also in the U.S. So it seems to me that globally, your gas volumes are declining well, about faster than I think was generally expected a year ago at the Analyst Meeting. Do you want to make a kind of general comment on that? Obviously, Exxon is very positive on gas in terms of demand going forward, so it seems strange in a way. I can understand the U.S. situation, but outside of the U.S., it seems strange unless there's some operational issue why gas is falling really so far. And it kind of makes you wonder about whether the rebound which you were forecasting last year, and overall production of 1% to 2% from 2012, is likely under this sort of progression we're seeing.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, that's -- let me kind of look at that on a full year basis. As you mentioned, gas in total year-on-year is down about 6%. If you look across the regions, I mentioned Europe already, and that was a chunk of that. One of the big factors is what I mentioned in the last quarter, we became cost current in our AKG project in Qatar, and you might recall that's a flowing gas project into Qatar as opposed to going into LNG. And that's the biggest driver. If you look at our Asia gas production, down about 500 a day or 10% year-on-year. There's a few things in there, but a big chunk of that is going to be the AKG project. Now if you look across some of the other ones, we did see, for example, in Australia, some lower demand this year across that was weather-related. And then if you look at the declines in North America, the U.S. down just a little bit. We have, as I've talked about over the year, had a fairly significant shift of our rig count away from the dry gas areas into the liquids-rich areas, in the places like the Bakken, in the Permian, in the Ardmore and away from some of the dry gas areas. And so you're certainly seeing that impact there as well. Canada, just there we had the asset sales you might recall, a year ago, and so we saw some of that. We got good value from that property and just normal decline. So if I look across all of the regions, there is nothing there that's unexpected. The only thing that happened a little quicker than we were expecting was the cost currency in AKG. We will be providing a fulsome update on our production outlook at our March Analyst Meeting, both on the liquids and the gas side. But I will say, just to kind of finish it up, if I look at expectations and performance, decline came in this year right about what we were expecting. Of course, we knew what the impacts of the asset sales would be and the cost currency on AKG, so from that standpoint and operationally, overall, downtime was a little better, performance improved there. So I wouldn't looked at the year-to-year change as anything to be concerned about or that we weren't able to do what we had planned to do. But again, in terms of going forward, we're certainly looking forward to visiting with you all in March and giving you a fulsome outlook on that.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, David. Could I tempt you on a question on the reserve outturn for 2012 or you going to hold that one over until you report that?","David S. Rosenthal","We'll hold that for a couple of weeks. We're going to do our normal mid-February report out on how the reserves and resource space is looking. And so if you'll bear with us for a couple weeks, we'll get that out about mid-February.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, last one then. If I look at CapEx, which obviously is higher than you outlined a year ago, can you just strip out the acquisitions you've made, so to tell us what the kind of organic CapEx is?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, that's -- let me take the opportunity to update on that because I think we had talked about $37 billion at the Analyst Meeting, and we said that did not include acquisitions. And so we had about $3 billion worth of acquisitions across the year. So if you take the $3 billion out of the $40 billion that we actually reported, we'd be pretty much spot on the outlook that we gave you in March.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two quick ones. David, in your presentation, on Page 16, you indicate that the $1.2 billion is the asset sales gain and the favorable tax primarily. Do you have an actual absolute number for the tax benefit in the quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","This was the -- which...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Page 16 on the Upstream.","David S. Rosenthal","Oh, okay. That's on the sequential.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So I mean do you have an absolute number, not sequential change, but the absolute number of the tax benefit in the quarter?","David S. Rosenthal","Sure. The absolute -- oh, let me see, I have a -- I don't have an absolute number. I can tell you what the change is sequentially, it's about $700 million of the $1.2 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's the sequential change.","David S. Rosenthal","Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If after the call you have that number and will be willing to share, if you don't mind to have someone just send me an e-mail.","David S. Rosenthal","Okay.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And secondly in Kearl, if we look at the actual cause for Phase 1 now is $12.9 billion. Last year, I think revised up to $10.9 billion and original budget was $8 billion, so this is somewhat uncharacteristic of Exxon given the cost of a run. And with that only about a year and you'd gone up from $10.9 billion to $12.9 billion, should we be concerned about the Phase 2, the current $8.9 billion that is going to be significantly higher?","David S. Rosenthal","Yes, Paul, let me -- let's talk a little bit. As you recall, between the very first estimate and the $10.9 billion that we gave, we reconfigured the project and put it into the initial production project and the expansion project and talked about the bottlenecks would come down, and that was one of the big factors in that. Of course, ForEx has played a factor in the overall project, et cetera. I think one of the things that's real important to keep a focus on is if you look at the total bitumen expected to recover by the first phase in the expansion phase, about 3.2 billion barrels of bitumen, the all-in cost for that, including this recent update that we gave on the dollar cost, is about $6.80 a barrel, total, all-in, and that compares to the $6.20 that we had given before. So we're up about 10% on a unit cost basis, as we work through both the initial project and the expansion. So while that is an increase, we're feeling pretty good about it given a lot of the challenges that we had to deal with in terms of transportation of the modules and the weather and that sort of thing. If we look specifically at the expansion project, where we have given an estimate on -- of $8.9 billion, and of course, that's a lot less than the first one because of all the infrastructure, the tailings dam and all that sort of thing that's already in there. The good news on that project is it's actually a little ahead of schedule as we're sitting here today. It's about 27% complete and moving right along and really, really starting to see the advantage of the ability to basically carry over all of the engineering work that was done on the first phase, building the second train right behind the first one, applying the learnings in kind of a real-time basis. So I don't have another cost outlook for you other than the $8.9 billion, but when you look at the schedule that we're on and the progress we're making, that project is coming along real good. And again, when you look at those 2 projects together, we feel real good about the competitiveness of that project going forward in this space. And then again, as the years go by, we'll look forward to the bottlenecking and getting up to that full 345,000 barrels a day we've talked about before. So...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And can I just maybe sneak in, on the shale oil, do you have a rough estimate, the number of rig that you're going to use in the U.S. for the shale oil's development? Is that going to be higher, about the same or lower than last year?","David S. Rosenthal","I think on average, you'll see that because of the big trend we made across last year where we kind of went from notionally 45%-or-so of the rigs as we came into the year doing dry gas, and now we're down to about 1\/3 on the gas side, 2\/3 on the liquids. So as you balance that out across the full year, you would, of course, see on average, year-to-year, more rigs associated with the liquids. We continue to optimize the whole rig fleet. But in terms of what the total rig count would be, that would be hard to say right now because, again, we've just gotten the Denbury deal done and we're looking at that and thinking about what we want to do and looking at some of the other aspects of our unconventional liquids program in North America. But we will be actively pursuing those resources and working hard on the development, but I just can't give you a specific rig count just yet.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Rosenthal, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David S. Rosenthal","I'd just like to thank everybody for your participation on the call today and all of your questions. And I -- we certainly are looking forward to our meeting in March and having the opportunity to talk more about our results and our plans for the future. And so we'll see you then. Thank you, all, very much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8291":["Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","","David Rosenthal \u2013 VP, IR","Analysts","","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Operator","Good day, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil\u2019s corporation\u2019s Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth remained constrained in the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to be sluggish after first quarter GDP growth was revised downward. ","China\u2019s economic growth continues to lag expectations while European economies remain weak. Energy markets delivered mixed result in the second quarter. The quarterly average crude oil price declined more $10 barrels per barrel from the first quarter. Narrowing the spread with WTI. While U.S. natural gas prices increased.","Global industry refining margins were essentially flat with increases in the U.S. margins offset by weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. Chemical commodity product margins declined across the quarter.","Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4, Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings were $6.9 billion, a decrease of $9.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012. Mainly reflecting the absence of prior gains associated with the Japan restructuring and divestments.","Earnings per share for $1.55. The corporation distributed $6.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $4 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx in the second quarter was 10.29 billion and 22 billion for the first six months of 2013 in line with anticipated spending plans.","Cash flows from operations and asset sales was $8 billion. At the end of the second quarter cash totaled 5 billion and debt was $19.4 billion. The next slide provide additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash decreased from $6.6 billion to 5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items including equity company dividend and our ongoing asset management program yielded $8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.","Uses included addition to plant property in equipment of $8.7 billion and shareholder distribution of 6.8 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $5.9 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the third quarter. Moving on to slide six and the review of our segmented result. Exxon Mobil second quarter 2013 earnings of $6.9 billion decreased 9.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012 reflecting the absence of prior gains associated with the Japan restructuring and divestments.","In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide seven. Earnings decreased by about $2.6 billion across all segments. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remained $500 million to $700 million.","Turning now to the upstream, financial and operating results and stating on slide eight. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $6.3 billion. Down $2.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012. Higher natural gas realization mainly in the U.S. partly offset by lower crude oil realization increased earnings by $90 million. Worldwide natural gas realizations increased a $1 per thousand cubic feet while crude oil realization declined $4 per barrel.","Production volume and mix effects had a small negative impact of $70 million. All other items mainly the absence again on prior year asset sales and the reimbursement of past exploratory cost to Rosneft for the Back Sea and \u2013Sea joint ventures decreased earnings by about $2.1 billion.","Upstream after tax earnings per barrel for the second quarter for 2013 were $17. Moving to slide nine, volumes declined by 78,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.9% from the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was down 26,000 barrels per day as field declined and divestments were mostly offset by increased production from liquid rich place in the U.S. project ramp ups and lower down time.","Natural gas production was down 307 cubic feet per day. As field decline mainly in the U.S. and lower entitlement volumes were partly offset by higher European demand lower downtime in several countries including Qatar and project ramp up. Note that entitlement impacts were all price and stand related. Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide ten. Upstream earnings decreased by $722 million versus the first quarter of 2013.","Realizations reduced earnings by about $360 million as worldwide crude oil and natural gas realizations decreased by $5.84 per barrel and $0.56 per 1,000 cubic feet respectively. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by about $300 million mainly due to lower European seasonal gas demand. Other items had a small net negative impact of about $70 million as the higher cost in Russia, mentioned in the quarter-on-quarter comparison were mostly offset by several small positive items.","Moving on to slide 11. Oil equivalent volumes were down about 7% sequentially. Liquids production was essentially flat, compared to the first quarter. Higher plant down time and field decline were mostly offset by improved reliability and project ramp-ups. Natural gas production was down 1.8 million cubic feet per day versus the last quarter, mainly due to lower seasonal demand in Europe. Our year-to-date volume performance is in in line with the projection presented at the analyst meeting in March with strong uptime performance, increased North America unconventional liquids production and higher European gas demand offsetting this lower than anticipated ramp-up at Pearl. We remain on target to meet the 2013 volume outlook presented at the analyst meeting.","Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $396 million, down $6.3 billion from the second quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan restructuring. In addition lower refining margins reduced earnings by $510 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 370 million, reflecting significant planned refinery maintenance activity across all regions.","Turning to slide 13, sequentially second quarter downstream earnings declined by almost $1.2 billion. Lower overall refining margins, including unfavorable price timing effects in the U.S. decreased earnings by $170 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 540 million, reflecting significant planned refinery maintenance activity at Juliette and Torrance in the U.S. and Strathcona, Saudi Arabia, Augusta and Singapore outside the U.S. This was the highest quarterly planned maintenance activity over the past five years. Other items reduced our earnings by $440 million primarily due to the absence of first quarter asset sale gains and costs associated with the Dartmouth Refinery conversion.","Moving now to the chemical, financial and operating results, starting on slide 14; second quarter chemical earnings were $756 million, down $693 million versus the second quarter of 2012. Lower specialty product margins reduced earnings by $100 million. Higher commodity product volumes driven by strong polyethylene demand increased earnings by $120 million. The absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring decreased earnings by $630 million while all other items decreased earnings an additional $80 million.","Moving to slide 15, sequentially second quarter chemical earnings decreased by $381 million. Lower margins mainly due to weaker aromatics prices reduced earnings by $200 million while an improved sales mix provided a $30 million offset. Higher plant maintenance expenses associated with Singapore\u2019s new steam cracker start up and the absence of gains from prior quarter asset sale decreased earnings by 210 million.","Moving next to the second quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. We continue to advance our portfolio of high quality upstream projects which we expect will deliver the liquids growth presented at the analyst meeting in March. The Kearl oil sands development continues to produce pipeline quality crude. We continue to ramp up production, having now run two of the three froth treatment trains individually as well as concurrently and achieved rates of 35,000 barrels per day through each. The third train is ready for initial operation and its startup will enable production to increase 110,000 barrels per day in the coming months.","The Kearl expansion project is on budget, ahead of plan and now over 40% complete. We are using existing Kearl initial development contractors for efficiency and continuity and achieving higher productivity as a result. The expansion project is scheduled for start-up in 2015. The Julia initial development project was sanctioned during the second quarter and is expected to develop more than 190 million gross barrels of oil with start-up in 2016. The initial development phase is being designed for daily production of 34,000 gross barrels of oil and includes six wells with subsea type tie-backs to the Jack and St. Malo production facility. Front-end engineering design has been completed and the engineering, procurement, and construction contracts has been awarded. The field is estimated to have nearly 6 billion barrels of resource in place.","Hebron construction activities continue with commencement of concrete ports for the gravity-based structure as well as fabrication of living quarters and drilling support module. Oil recovery from the project is estimated at 700 million gross barrels with upside potential. The platform is designed for production of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is anticipated around the end of 2017.","Turning now to slide 17 and an update on our efforts to progress global LNG projects and opportunities. The map to the left of the chart provides an overview of our LNG business, displaying gross existing production capacity of 64 MTA. The site\u2019s currently under construction and a number of future opportunities being evaluated. The PNG LNG project construction is currently 88% complete and is achieving project milestones towards a 2014 startup.","Commissioning activities for the first train at the LNG plant are ongoing while construction activities for the second train continue. Progress also continues at the Hides gas conditioning plant for equipment including gas turbine generators and utility systems that\u2019s being received and installed. We are also advancing expansion opportunities, including negotiations with NOL Corporation and Pacific LNG on the future development of the Elk, Antelope resource. Major terms have already been agreed and should negotiations successfully conclude Exxon Mobil is proposing that 4.6 TCF of the gas resource from the Elk Antelope field be used to underpin the construction of an additional train at the PNG LNG project site, subject to partner and government agreement. Construction at Gorgon is now 65% complete. Installation of the first subsea trees at [Jens] has commenced and offshore pipeline installation is ongoing.","Moving now to North America, Golden Pass Products, our venture with Qatar Petroleum International recently initiated the FERC pre-filing process setting the stage for essential permitting activity associated with the design, environment and construction of a proposed project to produce and export up to 15.6 MTA of LNG. Golden Pass Products already has an export for free trade agreement countries and awaits approval of its non-free trade agreement license from the Department of Energy.","Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum International also signed a commercial framework agreement in the second quarter which demonstrate the project\u2019s readiness to succeed based on its technical, financial and marketing capabilities.","In Western Canada Exxon Mobil and Imperial Oil recently filed an application with the National Energy Board for LNG export license to support the further assessment of the potential development of a natural gas liquefaction terminal on the Northwest of British Columbia. The export license requested is for up to 30 MTA for a period of 25 years. If developed the natural gas liquefaction plant LNG storage and marine loading facilities are anticipated to be in vicinity of either the [Kiddie map] or [Inaudible] areas.","We also continue to assess other LNG opportunities in Alaska, Australia, Russia and Tanzania. A range of factors will be considered before any final investment decision is made, in particular the fiscal and regulatory regime market conditions and capital cost.","Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our exploration activities. In June Rosneft and Exxon Mobil announced the completion of several milestones under the 2011 strategic corporation agreement, including joint venture formation for the Kara Sea and Black Sea projects. Collection of seismic data within both regions is underway and drilling operations are set to begin in 2014.","As we announced previously Exxon Mobil and Rosneft agreed to increase the scope of their strategic cooperation by adding seven new blocks in the Russian Artic spanning approximately 150 million acres. We have now entered into more definitive foundation agreements for joint ventures to explore within these areas.","Foundation agreements are also now in place for our joint venture Tide Oil project in West Siberia where data gathering is underway in preparation for drilling. Rosneft holds a 51% interest and Exxon Mobil has a 49% interest in this project.","Turning to Romania. Exxon Mobil and OMB Petron have successfully completed acquisition of the largest ever Black Sea 3D seismic survey on the Neptune D Block, covering more than 2,300 square miles. This survey will be used to continue the evaluation of the Domino Discovery as well as to evaluate additional exploration potential on the Block. In the Gulf of Mexico we recently spud the Maui deepwater prospect on Walker Ridge Block 282 after acquiring a 33% in the prospect during the first quarter.","Turning now to slide 19 an update on our unconventional liquids activities. In the Bakken play our gross operated production recently hit its highest level ever surpassing 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. For the quarter the equivalent production increased by 74% over the prior year quarter. This strong growth reflects higher per well production rates due to optimized drilling and completion practices and the shift to more pad development. For example after writing 20% in 2012, peak 30 day flow rates had increased another 15% in 2013.","We have also commenced evaluation of multiple ventures in the Three Forks Reservoir as part of a larger Bakken project involving XTO and our upstream research company. This initiative has a goal of increasing recovery, identifying further drilling and completion efficiencies and better defining resource size and distribution across our 580,000 net acres of leasehold.","In June of 2013 we started operations at a new cryogenic gas processing plant in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Located in Butler County this 340 acre facility we\u2019ll recover marketable liquid from Marcellus gas production. Two gas compressor stations feed the facility which is designed to treat approximately 125 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. More than 45 wells are expected to be contributing to production process at the plant by year end.","In our Appalachian operations we hold nearly 700,000 prospective net acres across the Marcellus and the Utica Shale plays. The liquids rich Woodford Ardmore shale in South Central Oklahoma remains our most attractive and active unconventional play with 12 operated rigs.","During the quarter we closed on a small bolt-on acquisition adding to our core Ardmore area and increasing our total acreage position to more than 280,000 acres. In the quarter gross operated production reached 31,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 73% over the prior year quarter. As noted in our March analyst meeting we are expanding the play into the overlying Caney shale. In the second quarter three Caney wells were completed and brought online, as we continue to delineate the reservoir across our acreage.","Additionally our first Caney well is being completed in the Marietta area Southwest of the Ardmore Basin where the initial Wordford well in April 2012 had a 30 day peak flow rate of just over 700 barrels per day of oil and 1.4 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.","Turning now to the Downstream chemical highlights and starting on Slide 20. We recently announced expansions to increase Group two premium lube basestock production capacity at our Baytown and Singapore Refineries. These expansion projects build on Exxon Mobil\u2019s strong manufacturing base at these two world scale facilities. Exxon Mobil is the largest producer of basestock for use in lubricant manufacturing in the world and these projects will help us strengthen our position as one of the industry\u2019s leading global suppliers of high quality lube basestocks. These expansions will employ Exxon Mobil proprietary technologies and increase production capacity of high value premium lube base stocks by 30%. Both projects are expected to start-up by early 2015.","Turning now to Slide 21 on the Singapore Chemical Plant Expansion Project, during the quarter Exxon Mobil Chemical began producing ethylene from the facility\u2019s second world scale steam cracker, more than doubling steam cracking capacity at the site and significantly increasing specialties capacity. We are now able to produce Exxon Mobil proprietary specialty elastomers and Metallocene based polyethylene in the Asia Pacific region.","Integrated with the existing petrochemical plant and powered by a 375 megawatt co-generation plant the new steam cracker is among one of the most energy efficient in our portfolio. The Singapore Petrochemical Plant is well positioned to serve growth markets in Asia Pacific while leveraging our feedstock flexibility in dozens of new technologies. In conclusion, in the second quarter we earned $ 6.9 billion, generated 4 8 billion in cash flow, invested $10.2 billion in the business and distributed $6.8 billion to our shareholders.","We maintain a long term perspective on our business with a relentless focus on operational excellence and disciplined investing through the business cycle. As discussed in the business highlights we continue to progress a unique set of profitable growth opportunities which position us well to deliver long term shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator\u2019s instructions). And we will take the first question from Faisal Khan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","If you could elaborate a little bit more on the refining downtime, I know you said that this is the most downtime you\u2019ve had in the last five years. But I looked at the last two quarters in a row, throughput has been relatively lower versus kind of 4Q last year and 3Q last year. Can you discuss kind of how these plants are coming back online and how it is going to trend for the rest of the year?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, if you look across the year, the first quarter also had a high turnaround work load, so if you look at how we are doing this year, the first quarter was high but the second quarter was even higher. And certainly if you look prior to this year, over the last five years, it was considerably higher than normal. In fact about 9% of our capacity was offline for plant maintenance in the quarter and we typically averaged about 4% to 5%.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, and then going forward is this all these plants back up and running or are you still have a significant amount of downtime?","David Rosenthal","No, these activities is now behind us and by and large all those units are back on line and up and running. And the other thing I will mention, Faisal, is we have a long standing practice of implementing improvement projects, minor projects anytime we have these large facilities down for an extended time. And we are certainly taking advantage of that opportunity and we\u2019ve done a few things at each of the sites to further improve the advantages that they have. Julia would be an example in the Midcon where we have done a few things to help improve our distillate production there.","So big downtime all of it planned, all of it coming back up. And we are looking forward to the third quarter and getting these things again back up and running and producing product.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, then last question from me on U.S. upstream capital expenditure looks like it kicked up really significantly from the first quarter this year to about 2.6 billion. Can you tell what is going on in the U.S. CapEx and in the trend going forward are you ramping up your program in different areas or how is that progressing.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, we did see a little if you are looking at a quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. upstream CapEx was up a just a little bit. It wasn\u2019t anything in particular. I can point to. We are doing, we have added some rigs, drilling activity is a little higher and just a number of other spend across the business.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, fair enough. I was looking from the first quarter to the second quarter it and looked like a big ramp up. Is that increased rig activity or is that \u2013 I thought you guys were cutting back on CapEx in North America, on the rig cap but that was one of the things that came out at the analyst meeting but maybe I am wrong?","David Rosenthal","Yeah I am sorry Faisal what you are looking sequentially we are up, we had a couple of minor XTO-based acquisitions. We added some more acreage in the Woodford that I mentioned and we had a couple of other items. Additionally drilling was up quarter-on-quarter sequentially by about $100 million. We did have also a net increase in rig activity by a couple of rigs. So it\u2019s continuing the program of ramping up the production capability of the liquids and also taking advantage occasionally when we have an opportunity to bolt on a nice piece of acreage that fits in one of our big areas.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","It makes sense. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","David Rosenthal","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ed Westwick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","Actually a follow-on from Faisal\u2019s question. Good morning.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Ed.","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just on the, back in refining and chemicals. Do you think third quarter will be sort of fully clear or will you be fully back up sort of in the fourth quarter?","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","We always have a little planned maintenance across the quarters and there will we some but if you look in across our major plans in the book of our maintenance and turnaround activity is behind us but we\u2019ll always have a little bit, but particularly if you are really looking at the second quarter heading into the third quarter and the fourth quarter this year yeah there will be a much lower rate of maintenance activity.","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","And you flagged Singapore startup cost, obviously a big plant. I mean any number that we could think about in terms of the sort of scale of that in the second quarter so that we can model it for the third quarter?","David Rosenthal","You know total OpEx in there was up a little bit. Singapore was an item but it\u2019s not real significant in terms of order magnitude. So as we continue to ramp up a little bit you will see a little more there but nothing I would really signal out as being material.","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay then a general question on LNG. I mean obviously Canada is a big opportunity, Tanzania and the Golden Pass Exports, I mean do you think we\u2019ll be talking about that at the analyst day next year with some granularity or you think it\u2019s further off in the future?","David Rosenthal","I think as we typically do at the analyst meeting we\u2019ll provide an update on all of those opportunities as they progress and hopefully by the end we can give you little more granularity in terms of expectations. But a number of things to look at and work on in the meantime.","I think the good news for us is we have a number of potentially attractive large scale opportunities out there and we are assessing all of them and we look forward to talking about it more in March and of course particularly here in the U.S. we are dependent on getting the permit for non-free trade agreement countries to progress that project. But in the meantime as I mentioned in my remarks we are working on other permits and by the time we get to March we hope to be able to give you a good update on that.","Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks very much guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Hi, good morning David. Actually I want to stick on the Canadian LNG. It sounds like obviously we will get some more detail down the road but I had a general question for you with regard to the resource potential that you have to feed the facility, do you feel that you have adequate resources to feed it or would you rely somewhat on third-party gas, just any color there?","David Rosenthal","Yeah I think in general you know we have the resources available to feed that that doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t bring in some other but if you look across our resource base in Canada in particular the acreage that we got with the Celtic acquisition you look at the Horn River a number of other properties we have out there, we are pretty well positioned just internally to support a major LNG facility. And that\u2019s why we are looking at it so hard but again it\u2019s one of many projects but I think we are in pretty good shape.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. My second question is really on U.S. natural gas. It seems like the decline has slowed a little bit from what we witnessed in previous quarters and I am just curious if that\u2019s a stabilization in activity levels or if some of the ramp-up you talked about with regard to Faisal\u2019s question it may be and if that was in the gas window?","David Rosenthal","Well we do have obviously more drilling in these liquids rich plays. There is some gas obviously that comes out for that and that gets produced. And what\u2019s you are generally seeing there is kind of the base decline rate that you have, particularly if you are looking sequentially across the quarters in the U.S. being offset by a little higher, higher production. So it\u2019s really just the continuation of the program that we had in place. It does tend to stabilize. One of the things that\u2019s interesting with some of these unconventional oils of these unconventional wells particularly on the gas side is you get all these tails that stack up and by and large that\u2019s mitigating impact by itself.","But we are also seeing very strong performance. I mentioned the Marcellus in particular but also in the Haynesville. So we\u2019re tracking right along in general some of the things we talked about at the analyst meeting, in terms of well productivity, some of the benefits we\u2019re getting from advanced completion technologies. You really starting to see that come into effect and in particular also on the liquid side. Whereas we talked about before we spent a lot of time after the XTO acquisition getting the Denbury trade dong a lot of delineation, a lot of appraisal working with the research folks on trying and improve our technologies.","And now you are starting to see kind of the fruit of those efforts as we ramp things up. More pad drilling et cetera. So we talked about it before and I know you\u2019ve been waiting to kind of see the results of Marietta at XTO capability, with Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology and research. And I think we\u2019re starting to see that come up and we look forward to continued production increases in those areas.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","I appreciate the color, David thank you.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Robert Kessler with TPH.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hi, David. Couple of questions if you don\u2019t mind just to quantify some of the variance figures. One thing the Rosneft on that reimbursement amount paid to Rosneft for past exploratory costs and then the other one just quantification of the unfavorable price earnings effects and the downstream. I think you said there was part of 170 million sequential margin variance. But if you could just specify each of those in absolute terms?","David Rosenthal","Sure I\u2019d be happy to. The Rosneft reimbursement of past costs was 220 million on an after tax basis. And if you look at the total price timing effects for the second quarter of 2013 they about 166 million in total, about 150 of that in the U.S. If you compare that to the first quarter we actually had a 32 positive. So if you are looking quarter-to-quarter sequentially in the U.S. that was about $183 million negative impact on a sequential basis.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Very helpful. Thank you.","David Rosenthal","All right, thank you.","Operator","Next is Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","David when we [travelled] this year you talked about [Rex] having a laser focus on efficiency gains, cost improvements and so on. If you look at the capture rate on your upstream margin this quarter, it doesn\u2019t really seem to be a lot of movements. So I am wondering if you could share some of those initiatives on what our expectations should be coming out of that? And I got a follow up please.","David Rosenthal","Sure. I think what I said was a little more broadly we had a laser focus on unit profitability. As we talked about at the analyst meeting where we acknowledged the fall back we\u2019ve had in the upstream unit profitability, given the mix of our production since the XTO acquisition and just reinforcing that we are very aware of this. We\u2019re working on it. Some of the portfolio projects that are coming online and particularly the liquids project are coming to fruition. We\u2019ve talked about the mix impact we\u2019re going to have over the next two or three years as all those liquids and liquids-linked projects come on.","So there is not a specific OpEx program or something like that it\u2019s top to bottom, it\u2019s production, it\u2019s margin capture, it\u2019s bringing the projects online see any improvement in the earnings but also I will say as we always have, continued focus on operational excellence and cost management. So that\u2019s ongoing. But it\u2019s not anyone particular program. I will say if you take out the Rosneft seismic reimbursement and look at some of our unconventional liquid increases sequentially across the quarter and how things are trending. I think you\u2019re going to see that upturn on a cost on a price constant basis here as we go forward.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that. My follow up I am afraid is the buybacks. I really just want to take frame this but oil prices were obviously lot stronger both domestically and internationally. You are targeting production goals with 90% weighted towards liquids and you had obviously a big one off working capital shift in the second quarter. So with that backdrop I know you don\u2019t like to talk about the longer term outlook for buybacks. But conceptually why would you be pulling back on your buyback program given that backdrop and what is your tolerance for net debt and the balance sheet and I\u2019ll leave it there?","David Rosenthal","Sure, let me add a little bit to your backdrop comments, because they are all quite valid to me. Let me add just a little of perspective on the buyback. If you look back over the past two years, so you look at 2011 and 2013 we bought back $20 billion in each of those two years in share buybacks. We also had over that, so $40 billion let\u2019s call it for the two years combined.","Over that same time period we had about $20 billion in debt proceeds from asset sales, so about 10 a year. So if you put those two together and you think about it we bought back $20 billion a year. 10 of it sourced from our operating activities and 10 sourced from proceeds from asset sale. Then if you come into 2013 and look at the first half we bought about $9 billion of shares back, have less than a $1 billion in proceeds from asset sales. So on equivalent basis we\u2019ve already bought back a little over $8 billion in share buybacks, excluding the proceeds from asset sales.","So if you look at it from that perspective the buyback actually remains quite strong. There is nothing magical about the $3 billion number for the third quarter other than we\u2019ve just take look at like we always do expect the cash flows for the quarter, our needs, cash requirements and that sort of thing. And just came up with the $3 billion number. We\u2019re also managing our capital structure this year and keeping that in line with our longer term objectives. But not any more complicated than that. Again I think sometimes people overlook the fact that asset management program that we had that last couple of years generated a significant amount of cash for us. And we returned all of that to the shareholder which I thought was very positive. So I hope that answers your question, if not I\u2019d be happy to talk about it in little more detail.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning, David. I\u2019ll look forward to the point assistants next time the call begins as well.","David Rosenthal","I\u2019ll look into that.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","My first question on PNG. I mean it\u2019s clearly a differentiated position for Exxon I know you discussed your negotiations required additional supply and you picked up some exploration acreage in the quarter. But could you discuss how additional expansion trend compared within your portfolio versus other projects that I know you have reviewed globally. And additionally with train one and two were I think in their five years from FID to expected first gas. I would presume expansion trains could be much faster than that.","And based upon the availability of gas does Exxon envision replicating a (inaudible) style development here of a train per type of a concept. I have a follow-up.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me kind of start at the back of your question first. Clearly as would be true of your project once you\u2019ve got all the facilities in play the pipelines the capacity the trains the utilities all the common facilities any addition is typically going to be quicker and have quite attractive incremental economics. So I wouldn\u2019t want give a specific time frame on an additional train at Papua New Guinea beginning other than they say we have plenty of land space there, we have plenty of infrastructure.","So we certainly have the ability to as rapidly as possible expand that facility over the course of the next few years and we do have a number of opportunities for gas we mentioned the [Interoil] discussions are going on we have had some success in exploration recently in Pingyang South and we have got some other exploration opportunities in the area. So we are optimistic on that.","In terms of relative economics of Papua New Guinea versus other projects I wouldn\u2019t want to give any specific comparisons or numbers other than to say we do view that project as quite attractive for us and we certainly look forward to bringing forward some expansion opportunities and continuing to improve further on those economics.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great that\u2019s helpful and my second question if I can follow up on the buyback I mean that\u2019s gone from five to four to three on a guidance basis with limited free cash flow in 3Q even if we see CapEx flat to down in 2014 we see some continued pressure on that buyback. So really the question is going to reiterate Doug\u2019s question would you consider using the balance sheet or larger than normal asset sales to support the buyback going forward which is also historically supported your very high returns.","David Rosenthal","One of the things to keep in mind as we go forward particularly as you look into 2014 and you get kind of the ramp up in production and particularly liquids production that we showed you in the analyst meeting, at current prices, you could certainly expect increased cash flow right from operations. So I think as that goes up and remember most of these assets, these projects that we are bringing online in the next few year have two things. One they are either oil-based or oil linked gas and they are no decline kind of projects.","So the CapEx requirement on a maintenance basis will be much lower than your typical oil projects and in the free cash flow generation out of that and the earnings impact were basically 90% of that increment tied to liquids. So you have to keep that in mind. When you think about, I guess the other one was using the balance sheet to buy shares. We manage the balance sheet really around to the whole capital structure that we want to manage and you have seen some increase in our debt levels here over the year.","You might recall back three years ago after the XTO merger we had about $19 billion of debt on the books. We paid, most of that off over the ensuing years, got rid of that high cost debt. We have replaced that with low cost commercial paper. So we do continue to manage the balance sheet, manage the capital structure of firm but also always maintaining that balance sheet flexibility that we have talked about.","So I wouldn\u2019t make any specific guidance on use of leverage or the buyback going forward, other than to say we continue to focus on cash flow generation and returning as much of that cash flow back to the shareholders as possible in the form of both increasing dividends which we did again this year and the buybacks.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And one last one if I could I missed it. On chemicals in the quarter were there any impacts of outages there particularly in the U.S. I think volumes were lower.","David Rosenthal","Yeah we did have some planned maintenance but it was kind of minimum in terms of the impact in the U.S. Yeah one of the things we did see in the U.S. that was helpful was some increased polyethylene demand and that kind of helped our mix but we did have some downtime in a couple of areas but nothing real significant.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. Appreciate it.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","John \u2013 with Society Generale is next.","John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah hi. Two quick ones Dave. With respect to the Bakken you said you were going to combine your [exploitation] as to XTO folks with your technical people should we expect to see more of an activity ramp given the potential of Three Folks in the Williston?","David Rosenthal","Yeah I think it would be logical to assume overtime as we continue to develop that resource, particularly taking this kind of full field development approach that you would see us ramp-up activity overtime. I have to say and I kind of alluded to it in my opening comments we are really pleased with the progress we are making in Bakken.","Again it\u2019s pad drilling, it\u2019s optimized completions, it\u2019s change in the way some things are done, incorporating the learnings as we go along. One of the things we talked a little bit about is not yet in a hurry, you don\u2019t want to drill a bunch of wells and then look back over your shoulder and wish you hadn\u2019t done that quite yet because you have learned a bunch. So I think we have a pretty deliberate discipline pace of growth in both activity and production but the gains that we are seeing year-over-year, we would like to continue and do more and not yet too far out in front of that curve.","John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, thanks. Next one from me is on the Tidal Oil pilot project with Rosneft. How long we will be in the science phase, next or so?","David Rosenthal","I think with unconventional resources in general we are going to be in science phase for a while. You know I think if you look at the West Siberia area tremendous opportunity for that joint-venture with us and Rosneft. We are in the process right now of gathering data but testing will begin this year. So that activity will startup before the end of the year depending on how that goes. That will determine the pace heading into next year but as we have done in all the other conventional we will prudent making sure we know what we have testing the resource itself, the quality of what we find underground and then looking for that commerciality determination but the area has plenty of infrastructure, plenty of support so if we can make it work we will get after it pretty quick.","John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. Last one from me is Maui deepwater, can you give us any more information on that?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, Maui is drilling ahead. We have not reached the target depth yet so because of that you know I really wouldn\u2019t want to say much more. Obviously in the next quarter we will have more to say on that. But the drilling is going fine as expected and we look forward to providing a little more update next time.","John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale","All right, thank you.","David Rosenthal","Hey, thank you Doug.","Operator","Next is Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","David with respect to [inaudible] on this net income to barrel marginal barrel profitability can we just \u2013 sorry to do this but can we go back to this Rosneft deal first. If I look at the earnings year-over-year the variance in the other category was 2.07 billion. I think you said it was 220 million of that was Rosneft, is that correct?","David Rosenthal","Yeah that\u2019s correct.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","What\u2019s the rest?","David Rosenthal","It\u2019s very simple. All of the rest is the absence of asset sales from last year. We sold our Block 31 in Angola, we booked some of the Japan in there, we have some other minor sales but that 2.1 billion it\u2019s 1.9 asset sales and 200 million for other reimbursement of past cost.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Got you. I mean I think generally speaking because we are as focused as Rex is on this issue it\u2019s the more detail we can get on this [sort of noise] the better that would explain why the sequential earnings were down only 70 million in other would include the 220 of Rosneft, right?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, that\u2019s correct.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So then there is obviously you know whatever it is 100 or something offset positive.","David Rosenthal","Yes. Paul, it\u2019s a number of small items, nothing really big to point out but yeah I think the important thing there is just what you have noticed. It\u2019s pretty clean on the other where you down all the factors in particularly given that we had a negative 200 million in there for the Rosneft cost.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, understood. The proceeds from the after-sales you also mentioned that you made a couple of acquisitions. Can we get some more detail on what the scale although you got 3 million of proceeds? I guess the acquisitions were in CapEx, right?","David Rosenthal","Yeah the acquisitions are in CapEx. I think all in less than a $100 million. I mean it wasn\u2019t significant in the quarter. There were some small bolt-on.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That was the acquisitions. What were the sales upstream? Sorry, I missed that. Excuse me.","David Rosenthal","The sales that we had, we had some minor ones in the upstream just some minor ones there.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","It was upstream.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, it was just a little bit of stuff there. Again net-net kind of there wasn\u2019t a big deal.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And I think you quite deliberately reiterated your guidance as given at the analyst meetings for, I think it was for full year \u201812 is that what you referred to?","David Rosenthal","Yeah, I just wanted to reinforce two things for you, the volume outlook is unchanged and the CapEx outlook is also unchanged.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great, I have got a kind of a detail one which is unfortunate but then if you could extend into the overall North America picture, can you update us on the status and future for the Pegasus pipeline and then can you also talk about how you are going to move crude out of Canada down into major refining centers on the Gulf Coast, thank you.","David Rosenthal","Yeah, let me hit the second one first. We have the ability if you are really referring to Kearl we have got the pipeline capacity in place for 10,000 barrels per day to move that either into the U.S., some of that into Julia and also into our other Canadian refineries. If you are looking in general Western Canada crude down into the west coast we have made some other arrangements to offset, what was coming down Pegasus. So that really hasn\u2019t had a big impact on us, on a net basis. If you look at the Pegasus pipeline incident, kind of broadly, I will tell you that the clean-up of that is going very well. We have removed all visible free standing oil from the environment. Many of the folks that were evacuated from their homes have completed re-entry process. So that\u2019s going well.","In terms of starting up that pipeline, you know, I really couldn\u2019t give you an estimate on that or an outlook. We still got some more work to do to determine the details of the investigation around that incident and what caused it and that sort of thing. So until we have got that completely nailed down and can, you know, think about that over the rest of the line, I just can\u2019t give you any update when that is going to be back in service.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so it is obviously now I think the interesting thing is, if I could say I believe it was built in 1940 that pipeline, right?","David Rosenthal","Yes, yes.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","David, I look forward to seeing you in September, thank you.","David Rosenthal","All right, thank you.","Operator","Next is Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hey, guys, good morning.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Two questions, David. In the second quarter, is there any one-off or some more unusual tax adjustment or inventory gain on those in any of your division that we should be aware?","David Rosenthal","No, Paul this is actually a pretty clean quarter along those lines.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Secondly, that Dave, I think you talked about the success story that you guys have in the Woodford and also in some of the unconventional play like Bakken. Can you give us a rough idea that how much is the total unconventional liquid production today that you are running at net to the company and also within that the percentage between the split oil, condensate and NGL?","David Rosenthal","Paul, I don\u2019t have the breakdown of unconventional liquids relative to conventional, certainly what we are seeing, if you look at how we are doing particularly sequentially in the U.S. where I think our liquid production are basically quarter over quarter our liquid production flat, what you are seeing is unconventional increase in liquid production is offsetting declines. And so you\u2019ve got you normal decline on the conventional being offset by the unconventional. But I don\u2019t have those two numbers.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Is that something that you guys will be willing to share and we could take it offline now or you could have someone to shooting me an email.","David Rosenthal","I think those kind of details will probably hold for a broader update in our analysts meeting in March. I think the important thing for us is this ramp up that we are seeing and the year- over-year increase that I have mentioned in my prepared remarks and again in particular the ability to grow these volumes at a lower capital cost as time goes on and a lower OpEx but I do understand your question. And I would look for an opportunity down the road to be a little bit more specific on that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And on the unconventional liquid, are your guys operating cost per unit or per barrel are they higher or about the same or lower than your average portfolio in the U.S.?","David Rosenthal","I don\u2019t know that I have that specific number in terms of coming up with conventional average cost versus an unconventional. Again Paul I think the important thing for us is to continue to ramp down those Op costs ramp up the well productivity as we depend on those unconventional liquids to offset the decline in the conventional. So I don\u2019t have a split out in the cost for you along those lines but again as this portfolio goes forward you will see an increasing amount in unconventional liquids offsetting and then growing more than the decline on the unconventional. But we\u2019ll also look for opportunity at the next analyst meeting to talk about that a little more as these volumes come up.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning, David.","David Rosenthal","Good morning, Allen.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Just a follow up question on your commentary related to the asset sales reporting, share repurchases in the past. First of all if there any current marketing of assets now that will be significant to potentially support the repurchases later this year and next? And then secondly on that point when you evaluate aftersales or the future potential of assets do you expect the returns on those future of those assets in the future relative to what you could potentially get on returns on buying your own stock and the valuation of your own stock so as the repurchase of \u2013 or use of proceeds factors into whether you decide to sell an asset or not?","David Rosenthal","Let me answer that second one. First those are two completely separate decisions. The decision to sell assets is sometimes it\u2019s strategic, like our decision to get out of owned and operated retail stores in the U.S. which also ties into the other part of asset sales which is they are worth more to somebody than they are to us and so often times when we look at something that looks like a strategic benefit for us it turns out that it marries up quite with an economic advantage for someone else.","When you look across our other assets either an upstream, downstream or chemicals it\u2019s a very simple analysis. What this things worth to us looking at both upside potential and downside potential and then how does that compare to the value, to a potential purchaser and when the latter is greater than the former generally speaking we\u2019ll conclude an asset sale and a lot of those sales are opportunistic, where people approach us asking to buy assets. So we don\u2019t have a program. We don\u2019t have a target or an objective where they come along and they are attractive we go ahead and do it.","And that kind of leads into \u2013 I really can\u2019t comment on future sales because as I said so many of those come about because we get approached by people and don\u2019t have any way to look at that. But I will say we did see a very successful program over the last couple of years and again as I mentioned earlier that cash flowed directly to our shareholders. But what we might do next quarter, next quarter or next year I just, I don\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t comment on.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thanks. And my second question relates to the factors that you outlined as far as [direction] relative to tracking of LNG project with respect to Australia and I understand you are going to pursue FLNG down there and the development of Scarborough. Is anything else beside that potential with respect to regulatory or capital cost in Australia that had may be abated in the past call six months to a year that made that project a bit more attractive than it maybe was a year or two ago relative to the rest of your portfolio?","David Rosenthal","We haven\u2019t seen a big change in terms of the cost structure. We are evaluating the potential of FLNG at the Scarborough prospect and those evaluations continue but again I would want a position that relative to any other project either already in the portfolio or one that we\u2019re looking at. Again it\u2019s nice to have the wide geographic flexibility we have and the opportunity set for LNG. So you got a lot of things in play as I mentioned fiscal term stability, capital cost in particular areas, infrastructure and that sort of thing, as well as the market of those things which serve.","So as we bring along this portfolio and evaluate it we\u2019ll be looking at different technologies FLNG is an example of that. Also different sizes the facilities and different locations and that sort of things. So we\u2019ll continue to progress that but don\u2019t have an outlook for FID and cost or any of those or certainly not relative competitiveness.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks. And just one quick one. I am sorry if I missed it. But on Asian gas volumes in the quarter was there a reason whether it be PSC or turnaround effect for the decline that\u2019s sequentially there?","David Rosenthal","If you\u2019re looking sequentially we had some downtime was a big piece of that. And then there also some price and spend impact on entitlements in the gas area there. But nothing outside of that unknown there.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Thank you very much.","David Rosenthal","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we go to Pablo Mockonoff with Raymond James.","Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks for taking my question. First just a quick one on PNG, LNG any sense of when you\u2019re looking to make a decision project extension on [inaudible]?","David Rosenthal","No, I really don\u2019t have an outlook on that. We\u2019re still in the commercial discussion on the potential for expansion. So until those concluded it would be difficult to give any forward guidance on timing after that. Other than we\u2019re working on it and if those negotiations are successfully concluded we\u2019ll be in a better position to talk about the going forward timeframe.","Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then segment from me we\u2019ve seen a number of large western players getting into the Vaca Muerta in Argentina in a pretty big way. Can we just get an update on where things stand with your JVs down there with I guess it\u2019s America\u2019s Petrogas.","David Rosenthal","Sure, I think as you\u2019re probably aware we\u2019ve got a huge position in the Vaca Muerta. We were kind of early mover into that area. We\u2019ve got a 11 blocks totaling over 800,000 net acres in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. And of course we\u2019re targeting the potential of the Vaca Muerta. We did have number of wells that we drilled last year and into this year. Some of those are on test. And others are being completed and we will be testing going forward. We do have a fairly active operated plan for the balance of this year and we\u2019ll get a few more wells down there over the course of the year.","The real key there is to kind of figure out where the windows are for the liquid versus the gas figure out what you got how it looks and not drill more wells then you need to define that resource. So we\u2019re pleased. The early results are encouraging and we continue to progress and like I mentioned minute ago we\u2019re looking forward to drilling our operated wells the rest of this year and give you a little better update as we progress.","Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James","Right, appreciate it very much.","Operator","We go now to Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, David. How are you?","David Rosenthal","I am good Ian. How are you?","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I am doing very well. Got a few things. Firstly on just coming back share buyback. Just wondering when you look at share buybacks and dividends. Do you kind of look at those together, because you\u2019re ramping down the share buyback at the same time you increased dividends payments fairly significantly. So do you look at that as kind of total shareholder return number? I know you\u2019re moving if you\u2019re like more towards dividends rather than share buybacks consciously or is it more about this disposal impact you were talking about earlier?","David Rosenthal","Let me talk about the dividends first. I think the most important thing to think about the dividend is we have a track record and certainly talked about on a go forward basis the objective of always growing that dividend overtime. The rate at which we\u2019ve grown that dividend over the last several years has varied a little bit although if you average it out over the last five or ten years it\u2019s been substantial. We did take a 20% hike in the dividend in 2012 and other 10% almost 11% this year. And I think as we talked about it in the analyst meeting that was to, in response to both desires of our shareholders and also to remain competitive in the marketplace.","So if you just hold that aside on the dividend than you get to the buyback and the buyback is of course driven by cash flow that\u2019s available to give back to the shareholder. And buybacks give us great flexibility in terms of managing cash and capital structure. And so I wouldn\u2019t combine that with the dividend. They\u2019re separate and managed in that manner. I think as you look back over the last few years at the sheer level of total distributions to the shareholders they have been quite impressive and again we have grown the dividend to meet those needs and then the rest of the cash has gone back in the form of the buybacks.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. second one is I was curious about this what you are talking about in terms of refining capacity being significantly down in the because if you look at it on a sequential basis it is down but not significantly compared to the first quarter. So is there anything else in these refining numbers which could explain the kind of really weak performance other than just the cost of what you are doing and also the downtime you are talking about?","David Rosenthal","Sure a big piece of the actually impact on earnings really comes from the fact that a lot of the refineries were down or some of our higher margin refineries for example our Julia refinery in the Midwest was down for two full months and that\u2019s without giving a specific number I can tell you that\u2019s a big chunk of what you are seeing in that earnings number. So it\u2019s not the just the amount of throughput or the amount of value that was lost but the mix of those refineries as well.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And last one just on tax rates if you don\u2019t mind, your tax rate kicked up fairly substantially in this quarter compared to second quarter of last year is that a purely mix effect or some of your competitors have being talking about the impact of the stronger dollar on deferred tax balances. So is this something we might see kind of maintain, at elevated rates if the dollar remain strong or is it something you would expect to reverse with refinery becoming little bit more profitable?","David Rosenthal","Yeah let me hit that, if you are looking for example the last year\u2019s second quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter the biggest impact of that there is the difference the tax rate on earnings and some of divestments and restructurings that we have. Aside from that if you are looking sequentially this year it is purely the mix effect where we are making our money upstream versus downstream U.S. non-U.S., so a geography there and you saw the results much different in terms of the downstream quarter-on-quarter.","I don\u2019t think foreign exchange rates are having an effect on us and going forward I don\u2019t have a specific number for you but if you kind of look back over the last several quarters and take out the impact of the big restructuring divestment we have kind of been in that kind of mid to upper 40s range. And so again, I don\u2019t have a specific outlook for you but if you take away a couple of those anomalies that\u2019s kind of where we have been.","Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","All right, David that\u2019s very kind. Thanks very much.","David Rosenthal","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Faisal Khan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Thanks David. Just have a follow up. Could you just [stress] how are you dealing with this [REMS] issue in the U.S. for refining and downstream where you guys fairly balanced or you do that more blending capacity that you gasoline production capacity and how retail and marketing sort of help mitigate some of that?","David Rosenthal","The answer to that is yes, we are a net purchaser of [REMS] but I will tell you we are pretty well balance we do generate the majority of our credit by blending our biofuels directly. So while it is an impact on us it\u2019s not real significant I think the more broader issue is that arena is really the RFS mandate and approaching hitting the blend wall next year from an industry perspective and it\u2019s not going to be matter of [REMS] pricing but just the fact that the [REMS] will be come in sufficient and compliance with the RFS mandate is just going to be infeasible.","So [REMS] are an issue it\u2019s topic but the more broader issue going forward is going to be the RFS mandate heading into 2014.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay. So just a comparable I am looking at your results for the quarter I shouldn\u2019t see any sort of material impact from Faisal [REMS] in the quarter?","David Rosenthal","No not at all.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay great. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude our quarter and answer session for today I would like to turn it back to David Rosenthal for any additional or closing remarks.","David Rosenthal","Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for time and questions today. We appreciate you being with us on the call and look forward to visiting with you next quarter. So thank you very much.","Operator","And thank you for your remarks. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation for today. And you may disconnect."]}}
