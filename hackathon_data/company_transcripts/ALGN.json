[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Shirley Stacy of Align Technology. Thank you, Ms. Stacy. You may begin.","Shirley Stacy","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining to me today is Tom Prescott, President and CEO; Roger George, Vice President, Corporate and Legal Affairs, General Counsel and Interim CFO; and Karen Silva, Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller.","We issued first quarter fiscal year 2013 financial results press release today via Marketwire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com.

We encourage listeners to review these items.","We've also posted a set of GAAP and non-GAAP historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, and our first quarter conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligners and scanner and CAD\/CAM services. In our release, I'm sure you noticed a charge we took against our scanner business. Roger will cover our Q1 financial results, including the discussion of that charge, as well as our outlook for Q2, and then I'll come back for a few closing comments and some questions.","Q1 was a solid quarter across the board. We started the year out with better-than-expected revenue and earnings, driven primarily by record Invisalign case volume. Strong Invisalign case shipments in North America, especially among orthodontists, reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices as well as continued sales and marketing activity to encourage doctor engagement.","During the quarter, we launched SmartTrack, our next-generation aligner material, which is now the standard for Invisalign clear aligners worldwide. We have received consistently positive feedback from our customers and their patients as they move beyond initial usage. We're excited about the potential for SmartTrack to help build even greater clinical confidence so our doctors who will utilize Invisalign more often and on more complex cases due to the improved control of tooth movements and the added benefit of increased patient comfort.","Let's get started with an overview of key highlights for Invisalign. For Q1, total Invisalign case shipments grew across all customer channels to a total of 98,200 cases, an increase of 15.1% year-over-year and an 8.5% increase sequentially.","Year-over-year growth was driven by increased Invisalign utilization, especially among North American orthodontists, as well as customer base expansion for North American GPs.","The sequential increase in Q1 primarily reflects strong growth among North American orthodontists as well as good growth from both North American GPs and international doctors. The uptick in North American Invisalign case volume we saw as we ended the year continued throughout Q1, reflecting steady patient traffic in our customers' offices as well as traction from customer engagement and practice development activities.","Switching briefly to our performance among the teenage patient segment. We continue to make progress here as more teams are being treated with Invisalign. This quarter, teenagers treated with Invisalign increased to 23,100, a year-over-year increase of 29% and a sequential increase of 13%, a positive direction as we head into this year's summer season.","From a product perspective, the Invisalign Teen product increased 27% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, primarily driven by North American orthodontists.","From an Invisalign product mix standpoint, growth was primarily driven by utilization of Invisalign Full and Invisalign Express products. This quarter, we saw positive uptake of Invisalign Express in North America and, to a lesser extent, Invisalign i7 in our direct European countries. These products to treat minor malocclusion grew a combined 47% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Adoption of our newest offering, Invisalign Express 5, was driven by both our ortho and GP dentists in North America as many took advantage of a $200 off promotion we ran during the past quarter to spur increased trial and repeat usage.","For North American orthodontists, Q1 case volume -- Q1 Invisalign case volume of 38,000 cases increased nearly 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign as well as cases from some newly trained doctors.","Sequential growth of 13% was driven by increased usage of Invisalign, especially among higher-volume orthos. We believe the interest in SmartTrack may also have played a role in this improving level of engagement among orthodontists.","For North American GP dentists, Q1 case volume of 36,700 cases increased 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting continued expansion of our GP customer base and slightly lower utilization due to this larger customer base on a sequential basis.","Q1 Invisalign case shipments outside of North America increased 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth across direct and distributor geographies. On a sequential basis, Q1 Invisalign case shipments increased 5%, a bit better than expected, with good growth from our direct countries in Europe and Asia, offset somewhat by our distributors.","In Europe, we continue to make good progress in our core direct countries. Year-over-year growth was led by the Central European countries of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as well as solid progress in both France and Spain.","On a sequential basis, Spain and Italy were up nicely despite the widespread economic challenges there. Across Europe, we continue to focus on clinical education programs as a key lever to help expand our customer base and increase utilization of Invisalign. In Q1, we trained a large number of new customers and have been working to reengage doctors who had previously been trained but did not submit any cases.","We've also seen good uptake from the launch of Invisalign i7, our minor tooth movement solution, which is now available in all direct markets in Europe.","Early results from our pilot in the U.K. suggest that many of our existing customers adopted i7 for minor correction cases instead of using competitive products. New customers have also reported they are adopting Invisalign into practice based partly on the potential offered by i7 in their practices to treat those minor malocclusions.","Turning to Asia Pacific, I'll spend a little more time in this geography than I typically do, given some significant recent developments, one being the addition of our new Vice President for the region; two, the transition of our Asia Pacific distributor into a direct sales region starting May 1; and three, with all that in hand, the formation of a Pan Asia Pacific organization.","Starting with results for the region, during Q1, our direct Asian country markets of Japan and China continued to make great progress, albeit off a small base. In China, our strategy of leveraging key opinion leaders and focusing on top providers is contributing to continued strong growth in the targeted major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.","We continue to see growth from our most experienced providers, driven by evolution in product and technology with Invisalign G3, G4 and now SmartTrack, as well as by word-of-mouth and increasing interest in Invisalign among GPs and orthodontists.","In Japan, Q1 was a strong quarter for Invisalign case shipments, and I'm very pleased to see real progress in this market. The strength in case growth is driven primarily by mid- to high-volume orthodontists as well as from the cumulative impact of training more doctors over the past few quarters and then getting these practices started with Invisalign.","It's good to see this growing interest and a positive response to our continued cycle of innovation, which is essential to treat these more complex cases.","Shifting now to geographies covered by our Invisalign distributors in the APAC, EMEA and Latin America regions. Q1 was up nicely year-over-year and yet down slightly from Q4. On May 1, our Asia Pacific distributor will transition back into a direct region for Align, and we are excited about becoming more directly involved and engaged in this tremendous growth opportunity.","We recently announced the hiring of Julie Tay, an experienced global medical device executive from both J&J and Bayer, to run our Asia Pacific operation. Julia has already spent time pulling our teams together in the field and is focused on ensuring great execution for all aligned products and services in this Pan Asia Pacific region. This widespread set of countries represents one of the best global growth opportunities for Align Technology over the next 3 to 5 years.","Now let's turn to utilization and training. We continue to focus on expanding our customer base, primarily among North American GPs and international doctors, as well as increasing utilization among new and existing practices. For Q1, total Invisalign utilization was 4.3 cases per doctor, an increase from 4.1 in both Q1 of 2012 and Q4 of 2012, driven primarily by North American orthodontists, followed by international doctors and North American GPs.","During Q1 of 2013, we trained a total of 1,660 new Invisalign doctors, adding 65 North American orthos, 690 North American GPs and 905 international doctors.","Pivoting to the topic of product innovation. On January 21, we announced that our next-generation aligner material, SmartTrack, is now the standard of aligner material for Invisalign in North America and most international markets. The commercialization for SmartTrack was initiated in North America, as it was announced during our Ortho Summit in Las Vegas last November, followed by -- shortly thereafter by the official launch in January.","Now, with SmartTrack in use for almost a full quarter in North America, we continue to receive positive customer feedback from doctors and their patients. In a recent customer survey, 80% of respondents cited SmartTrack product improvements as the reason why satisfaction was up for Invisalign.","When asked, \"What new orthodontic product or trend excites you?\" SmartTrack was top for both orthos and GPs. Based upon detailed data and clinical evidence demonstrating superior performance, doctors report SmartTrack gives them more confidence to use Invisalign more often and on more difficult cases.","During Q1, SmartTrack was also launched outside of North America, and we're now starting to get some initial feedback from the international customers.","In Europe, our doctors welcomed the SmartTrack launch, with over 870 doctors attending high-impact clinical education events across 11 major cities in February alone. Feedback from our customers confirms the benefits of delivering consistent moderate force and ensuring precise aligner fit. They also love hearing from their patients about better comfort.  As a result, many customers are considering expanding the range of applicability and trying Invisalign on even more complex cases.","In March, we held an Invisalign SmartTrack clinical seminar in Tokyo, with more than 150 Invisalign providers attending the event. This is the largest number of Invisalign doctors to ever participate in an Invisalign event in Japan.","Our integrated consumer marketing platform has historically been focused on the North American market and combines paid media like print, broadcast and digital along with a mix of traditional PR and event marketing, all surrounded by social media outreach. The goals of this platform are to generate awareness of and preference for Invisalign and Invisalign Teen as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among women, especially moms, and teens. Increasingly, as our business evolves in key markets like Europe, we are utilizing consumer strategies also help drive growth.","Q1 was a strong start to the year in terms of traditional media outreach. We secured national broadcast coverage on The TODAY Show and The Doctors, reaching combined audiences of more than 9 million consumers. We also kicked off an exciting new program targeting the important adult female market with the Invisalign wedding campaign. This new campaign will focus on brides-to-be at a time when they're already planning how to look and feel their best on their big day.","In Q2, we'll dial up our efforts in traditional media, both TV and radio, along with high-impact satellite media tours, expert spokesperson interviews and other activities designed to leverage Mother's Day media opportunities.","In addition, we're continuing to reach moms and teens as we look ahead to prom, graduation and the busy summer teen season.","Our social media program, including Twitter, Facebook and our network of influential mom bloggers, continues to be a great way for current and potential patients to learn about the brand and engage with one another. We'll also reach, educate and influence moms specifically this year to our Straight Talk event series, a program that combines the reach of social media with the impact of a live event. We've kicked off a multi-tiered live event program for the Straight Talk series in the top 10 Invisalign Teen markets that will be taking place in April and May.","One of the ways we know these and other programs are effective and that we're reaching potential patients is by tracking visitors and activity at Invisalign.com. In Q1, site visits were up almost 30% from Q4, and we doubled our mobile device traffic from the previous quarter.","Looking ahead, we are excited about the consumer campaign we're launching in Q2, with new created-for-TV, digital and mobile platforms, all focused on the journey of Invisalign treatment.","We're planning to be on TV for most of Q2 to fully leverage our new campaign as we head into the important summer season. Look to see our new ads on air just after Memorial Day weekend.","And turning to Europe, our smaller but strategically important consumer marketing investments continue to help facilitate market expansion and adoption growth in our direct country markets. We've seen a significant rise in awareness with increases in web traffic and social media activity across our markets, and we'll continue our investment in consumer awareness campaigns in Q2.","Let's now shift to our scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment. As Shirley said at the beginning of our call, in Q1, we recorded an impairment charge for a portion of our long-lived assets and all remaining goodwill related to the scanner and CAD\/CAM services reporting unit. These are in addition to the charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of 2012.","Although we determined it was appropriate to record the impairment charges related to the scanner and CAD\/CAM services unit, our long-term view of this business remains positive, and we will continue to execute plans to be a leader in this business. In addition, we continue to see leverage in the Invisalign business for scanner technology and maintain our belief in the long-term benefits of the scanner and CAD\/CAM services business.","Invisalign utilization among scanner customers, particularly orthos, continues to grow, and we expect this positive trend to continue. The drivers for this growth come from better customer and patient experience driven by recent scanner innovations, including the new iTero scanner. In addition, the recently launched Invisalign Outcome Simulator brings a valuable patient education tool right to chair-side to help doctors show the benefits of Invisalign treatment to prospective patients.","Moving towards operating results of this business. North America continues to perform solidly in the top line. Among our core Invisalign customers, we are leveraging our direct sales force and also taking full advantage of our scheduled customer events like summits, forums or study clubs to help drive sales of iTero scanners. This purchase is especially attractive for our ortho customers, who are looking to differentiate or streamline their practices by integrating intra-oral scanners to completely replace the cost, mess and unpleasant patient experience associated with taking PVS  impressions.","We continue to see an increase in Invisalign case submissions from a digital impression instead of a PVS impression. The percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scan rather than a traditional physical impression rose to 19% in Q1 compared to 17% in Q4 and 9% in Q1 of a year ago.","This trend is positive for both Align and our customers, as most of them reported faster ClinCheck turnaround case shipments -- reported faster ClinCheck turnarounds to case shipment with less hassle to patients, and all reports to date indicate better aligner fit.","Looking ahead, we continue to believe there are potentially a few other high-quality intra-oral scanners that over time can be made to support interoperability with Invisalign. Before we would move ahead with this, Align will need to ensure the quality of the scan as well as the customer experience is up to our high standards. And just like we do with other R&D initiatives, we do not discuss futures. When there's any meaningful news report, we will do so. Until then, iTero is the only scanner with Invisalign interoperability.","And I'll now turn the call over to Roger for a review of our Q1 financial results. Roger?","Roger E. George","Thanks, Tom. Before I go through our Q1 operating results, I would like to note that there are several items we exclude from our GAAP results. These include impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill for our scanner and CAD\/CAM services business, which are detailed in our Q1 press release. Recent changes in the competitive environment, including announcements in March of new lower-priced scanners, have caused us to reevaluate our outlook for scanner revenue and profitability. Our iTero scanner offering is at a premium price due to its technology, utility and end-to-end connectivity. However, we believe that our customers may respond to lower-priced scanners with less utility offering.","As a result, we reduced our volume projections, and this triggered an impairment analysis of long-lived assets and goodwill. From these analyses, we recorded impairment charges for goodwill of $40.7 million and $26.3 million for long-lived assets. Even though we determined that goodwill and the long-lived assets were impaired, this does not deter our belief in the overall long-term benefit of intra-oral scanners or in our plan to offer the best technology and utility at a competitive price.","In my comments today, I will not review the total dollars excluded for non-GAAP gross margins, operating expense and operating margin, and instead refer you to our press release tables entitled Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics and Business Outlook Summary for a complete reconciliation.","Let's review our first quarter financial results. Q1 net revenue was a total of $153.6 million, which consisted of Invisalign revenue of $141.6 million and scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue of $12 million. Q1 net revenue increased 7.5% from $142.8 million in Q4 2012 and 13.7% from $135.1 million in Q1 last year.","The sequential increase in revenue primarily reflects higher Invisalign case shipments and, as expected, an increase in the Vivera Retainer revenue from consolidating shipments down to 1 shipment per year. This shipment change for Vivera Retainers was based on feedback from our customers, indicating that it would make their practices more efficient. Given our commitment to improving the Invisalign customer experience and helping doctors achieve the best results for their patients and their practices, this was an easy decision to make.","We seek to continually evaluate and improve our products, our customer support processes and policies to support this goal. As a result, we are making an additional change based on customer feedback that also impacted Q1 Invisalign revenue. Beginning on June 15 of this year, we will no longer charge a fee associated with our midcourse correction offer -- orders. Midcourse correction provides our customers with the option of requesting a treatment correction during the active treatment if the case is not tracking to the original plan or goals.","As of June 15, we will include up to 3 midcourse correction orders per case, free of charge, in our list prices for Invisalign Full and Invisalign Teen. As a result, Invisalign clear aligner revenues for Q1 of this year were decreased by $2.7 million, representing the revenue deferred to provide free midcourse correction for open cases that we expect to be eligible when this new policy takes effect on June 15.","Q1 Invisalign revenue of $141.6 million increased 6.6% compared to Q4 revenue of $132.8 million and increased 14.8% compared to Q1 of last year of $123.3 million. The sequential increase in Q1 revenue reflects increased North American ortho case volumes followed by North American GPs, with international being relatively flat from Q4.","Revenues were impacted by lower ASPs due to higher promotions and rebates, as well as product mix shift to lower-priced products. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign revenue growth was driven primarily by higher volumes across all customer channels.","Q1 2013 scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue was $12 million. This is a sequential increase of 20.3% from $10 million in Q4 of last year and a year-over-year increase of 2.2% from Q1 of last year. Q1 '13 scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue include $1.4 million that was reserved in Q3 and Q4 2012 for the new iTero scanner upgrade program, which was launched in Q1.","This upgrade program was successfully implemented, and the full reserve was not utilized. As expected, Q1 scanner shipments were down from Q4, which is typically the strongest quarter for dentists, oral surgeons or orthodontists to purchase capital equipment. Q1 CAD\/CAM services revenues were up slightly from Q4 but down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to discontinuing the OrthoCAD IQ bracket template placement product last quarter.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Q1 GAAP gross margin was $112.8 million or 73.5%. This compares to $106.5 million or 74.5% in Q4 and $100.8 million or 74.6% in the same quarter last year. Q1 GAAP gross margin for Invisalign was 77.2%, and scanner and CAD\/CAM services gross margin was 29.3%. This compares to 78.8% and 18.5%, respectively, in Q4.","There is no difference between Q1 '13 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin this quarter, but compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $106.5 million or 74.5% in Q4 and $101.2 million or 74.9% in the same quarter last year. For Invisalign, there is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 or Q4 2012 and Q1 2013.","The sequential decrease in gross margin primarily reflects a $1.1 million reserve of the older aligner material as we transition to SmartTrack material, which we described on last quarter's conference call. For scanner and CAD\/CAM services, there is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q1, but compares to non-GAAP gross margin of 18.5% last quarter and 32.4% in Q1 of 2012.","The sequential decrease reflects lower volume and higher warranty costs. Q1 GAAP operating expense was $150.9 million compared to Q4 of '12 operating expense of $89.4 million and Q1 of '12 operating expense of $72.8 million.","Q1 '13 GAAP operating expense includes long-lived assets and goodwill impairment charges of $67 million. Q4 '12 GAAP operating expense includes goodwill impairment charges of $11.9 million.","Q1 non-GAAP operating expense was $83.9 million. This compares to $77.5 million in Q4 and $72 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in Q1 non-GAAP operating expense is primarily due to the inclusion of the medical device excise taxes, which went into effect in January; higher consumer demand spending, including development of the new consumer campaign that will launch on TV in May; as well as upcoming major customer events in North America such as the AAO meeting in Philadelphia and our European summit in Rome.","Q1 GAAP operating loss was $38.1 million or 24.8%. This compares to $17.1 million or 12% in Q4 and $28 million or 20.7% in the same quarter last year. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $28.9 million or 18.8%. This compares to $29 million or 20.3% in Q4 and $29.2 million or 21.6% in the same quarter last year.","Q1 GAAP diluted earnings loss per share was $0.52 compared to EPS of $0.12 in Q4 and $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.26 compared to $0.26 in Q4 and $0.26 in Q1 last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term investments, were $377.4 million. This is compared to $356.1 million at the end of 2012.","In Q1, we generated roughly $10.4 million in cash from operations compared to $50.8 million in Q4 and $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. During Q1, we purchased approximately 75,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $32.47 per share for a total of approximately $2.4 million. There remains approximately $92.7 million available under the company's existing stock repurchase authorization.","Q1 days sales outstanding were 64 days compared to 62 days in Q4 and 63 days in the same quarter last year.","Now let's turn to our business outlook for Q2 and the factors that inform our view. 2013 is off to good start. Our North American customers report stable patient traffic in their offices. We expect our North American orthos to benefit from increased teenage orthodontic case starts as the summer season kicks off and anticipate Q2 Invisalign case volume to be up nicely from Q1. We expect Q2 Invisalign case volume for North American GPs to be flat to slightly up from Q1.","For international doctors, we would expect Q2 case volume to be up from a seasonally slower Q1. As doctors increase their utilization, we are anticipating higher advantage rebate participation. We also anticipate continued product mix shift in Europe to lower ASP products like Invisalign i7 in Q2.","As a result of our new midcourse correction policy, which takes effect June 15, we will have an additional deferral in Q2 for the cases shipped between April 1 through June 15 that are expected to be eligible for the new policy.","The usage rate for midcourse correction orders is expected to approximate the revenue deferrals and will therefore offset each other. In addition, as a result of no longer charging and billing customers for midcourse correction orders, we anticipate a reduction of approximately $700,000 per quarter, a small price for improving the Invisalign customer experience and helping doctors achieve great treatment outcomes for their patients.","For scanner and CAD\/CAM services, as discussed earlier, due to recent changes in the competitive environment for intra-oral scanners, including announcements in March of new lower-priced intra-oral scanners targeted at North American orthodontists and GP dentists, we have lowered our outlook and expect Q2 scanner and CAD\/CAM services to decrease sequentially from Q1.","With that as a backdrop, Q2 Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 102,200 to 104,700 cases, reflecting 7.2% to 9.8% year-over-year growth.","We expect Q2 total revenues to be in the range of $153.6 million to $157.4 million. We expect Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 74.5% to 75%.","In Q2, we expect operating expense to be in a range of $85.7 million to $87.1 million. The expected sequential increase in operating expense relates primarily to higher TV media and advertising spending and includes expenses for our Asia Pacific operations as of May 1.","We expect Q2 operating margin to be in a range of 18.7% to 19.7% and EPS to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.28.","In Q2, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 83.9 million and cash on hand to be in a range of $405 million to $415 million, excluding any stock repurchases.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom for closing comments.","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Roger. Overall, I'm pleased to see our Q1 results, especially with respect to Invisalign volume. And as indicated by our guidance for Q2, we believe we can build on this good start. These results begin with stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and are driven by good execution of practice-building activities.","Heading into Q2, we expect to keep our focus on driving increased activity in offices and better customer engagement, even as GPs, orthos and their patients all kind of heading in different directions with summer approaching. Fewer patients schedule routine dental care around the summer vacation period. As a result, many GP dental offices close for at least a few weeks. Our job and our challenge is to keep those GP offices engaged and their patients interested even through the early part of summer.","On the other hand, Q2 also marks the beginning of the busy summer season for our ortho customers and teenager orthodontic case starts, and we would expect to continue to gain what we call share of chair among the North American orthos this year.","At the same time, full appointment books for teens during the summer can crowd out adult consultations at the ortho office, so we'll stay actively engaged with our customers and with their potential adult and teen patients as we launch an exciting new consumer campaign in late May. On the international side of the business, we are looking forward to bringing the Asia Pacific team back in-house on May 1. We've now got a strong team in place there and are excited about the growth potential this region offers. And even though the summer is typically a slower season for case starts in Europe, we'll continue building our brand awareness in core European markets.","Q2 will be a busy quarter, with numerous important initiatives underway or just launching, but we know that one of the best ways we can engage with our customers around the world and earn their confidence and increased utilization is by delivering product improvements and innovations that help them deliver great treatment results. We believe our new SmartTrack material is the most impactful of these recent innovations, with the right level of constant force, improved tooth control and greater comfort for patients. This will increase the number and complexity of cases doctors treat with Invisalign.","I look forward to updating you on our progress as this year continues to unfold. And with that, let's get right to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Dolan from Roth Capital Partners.","Matthew Dolan - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","So you indicated you're off to good start to the year. I just wanted to touch on the volume guidance for the second quarter. If I'm calculating it right, it's 8% or 9% growth year-over-year versus a 15% rate in the first quarter and a high-teens type of number in the last couple of years. So just walk us through maybe what is difficult in terms of the comp relative to those historical numbers that you're expecting in the second quarter.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. Well, there's a couple of different things working. I'd say the biggest part of the challenge is that, as other dental companies go out there and report, I don't think anybody is going to be describing the dental market as easy right now. We believe we're going to do better than most, and the good news is, our customers report what we'll call -- we keep calling stable traffic. Not booming. GPs are still somewhat unwilling to try and upsell a more valuable procedure, and unless traffic improves a bit, we're going to have to keep working hard to make that happen. So that's maybe the back story. We do believe, within all that, there are opportunities to go after the ortho volume and certainly set ourselves up for summer. But I think the -- and then we have plenty of economic issues around the world that keep us from being more bullish. We think we can make good continued progress, and that's kind of how we're calling it.","Matthew Dolan - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But just to clarify, sorry, has the macro environment therefore deteriorated a little bit? Or why the decrease, I guess, is what we're looking for?","Thomas M. Prescott","I wouldn't say the macro environment -- macro, I don't think it's getting any better. We tend not to overreact in the nearer term to the big macro elements like consumer sentiment, which is back down now, and others. We think the primary secular trend for us is patient traffic. If patient traffic, in general, trends up, we think we can over-perform, especially in the GP side. But I think what you're seeing is the total of all that already in market. No new trend, just the challenges of pushing that uphill a little bit. But again, I think we continue to feel solid about the overall growth story for the year.","Matthew Dolan - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then second -- my second question has to do with the margin. I know you have some major customer events in the second quarter. But you're still in the high teens in terms of operating margin through the first half of the year. What -- where are you on the goal that you stated on the last call, targeting the low end of your long-term range in the mid-20s in terms of an operating margin by around the end of this year?","Thomas M. Prescott","Matt, setting onetime charges aside, on a non-GAAP basis, and we describe our model that way, I will continue to say we expect we can approach the low end of our -- we believe we'll be comfortably within our volume and revenue guidance. And I won't mess with every other element other than to say, on an operating margin line, we believe we can approach the lower end of that, around 25%, by year end. And we believe that's important to do so, so we're going to keep working that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I actually had just a follow-up to the first question. Clearly, the first quarter results, from both a case and revenue perspective, came in above guidance, so it does look like this year got off to a strong start. But if we do think about some of the macro and, more specifically, consumer data points that we've seen most recently in March, certainly things -- it looks like things maybe have fallen off a bit. I was just kind of curious if you'd be willing to share how the quarter itself trended as we try to think about 2Q. I mean, were you out of the gate strong in 1Q, and we saw things kind of level off in March? Or are you coming into 2Q on an upswing?","Thomas M. Prescott","Let me be thoughtful about how I respond, because we generally don't provide a detailed view of our pipeline. I think, as we described in the call, we -- if we go back to Q4, Bob, the evolution of our business was a pretty strong move towards the end of Q4. And that solid progress continued into Q1. Certainly, by the time we did our call, we were commenting on, in a qualitative way, about volume bouncing back. I would say the quarter generally evolved in a consistent way. Again, not tearing the cover off the ball here, but solid progress. I think SmartTrack and these other elements really helped engage the ortho community, and we're seeing that around the road as well, which is largely an ortho community outside North America for our customer base. Very responsive to anything that helps treat more complex cases, which is their norm. And then on the GP side, as long as we can have steady kind of patient traffic, our GP customers will at least stay involved. It would be helpful if it was more robust, but we can certainly work with what we've got. So again, our -- the business continues to evolve. We're not exactly linear, but I think it looks a little more predictable right now than it was during parts of 2012, notwithstanding what else could happen here. I don't think that answers your question.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, that does. That's helpful. And then I guess just one within the categories, the Express\/Lite category continues to grow impressively, certainly ahead of our expectations. I was just curious if you could comment on more specifically where you see that growth coming from, and I guess what I'm getting at is there's certainly always a fear or concern that, that growth could come at the expense of the Full line. Are you seeing these starts coming from historical cases that might have come from the Full line, or is this really purely you penetrating into a category that wasn't necessarily being fully utilized before?","Thomas M. Prescott","It's really the latter, Bob. We've actually done a fair amount of work talking to our customers, and in most cases -- and I'll set North America, where we've been dealing with Express 5 a bit longer, aside from the new i7 launch in the U.K. and Europe -- we have seen virtually no cannibalization. In fact, it's actually attracting some people that at least get started with just closing a very small space or reducing a very little bit of crowding. And what doctors are reporting for people that aren't ready to do a full treatment, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 worth of treatment, they are in many cases getting engaged, finishing this 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks of treatment and then saying, \"Boy, when I can, I want to come back and do the rest of it, now that I'm really aware.\" So we think if there's any cannibalization right now, it's too small for us to measure. What it is doing is taking some share away from all the hundreds and thousands of little labs that have been apparently providing some of these very simple cases to both GPs and orthos. Or in some cases, an ortho may be doing a suck-down in their own labs. So for us, we saw this as something we could do better than most everybody else from a precision perspective. And done properly, we ought to be able to move more in 5 stages than anybody else in the world, and more predictably. So we think it's actually positive, and perhaps, it leads to a patient that only does a little bit of correction now but is now becoming much more aware of what they want, thinking about their broader treatment, they come back and do full-on. So I think it's maybe just the reverse over time. U.K. is a little differently with the  austerity, and we started with -- in the U.K. for 2 reasons with the i7 pilot. One is we have a broader base of GP dentists there than elsewhere in Europe. And two, we've had, had some more localized competition there. And so we did a pilot, and we got great response for it. There's clearly a price point out there at the patient level, the consumer level, and there's an interest at the doctor level, both orthos and GPs. And so we've rolled that out across our direct geographies in Europe now, and we expect that, that'll take its place as maybe an entry offering for minor malocclusions. So we think it's upside in general. And again, I'll repeat, to the extent there's cannibalization, it's very, very small.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I actually had just a couple of housekeeping items. And I don't know if this is for Tom, perhaps, or for Karen or for Roger. But on the Vivera item that we had here in this quarter, $4.4 million as expected. Is it right that we'll have no impact from that phenomena in 2Q, or do we maybe get another potentially small impact?","Thomas M. Prescott","We'll have Karen Silva, our VP of Finance, take this one. She's the expert.","Karen Silva","Steve. This is Karen. So the Vivera release of $4.4 million was folded in Q1. And going forward, we don't expect additional pops in revenue related to the Vivera consolidation.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that's an -- we won't see anything about that in the next quarter's release? Okay. And then...I'm sorry?","Karen Silva","I said no, that's correct.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then same question on the fourth quarter item, the return reserve release. No more impact from that as well?","Karen Silva","Yes, you're talking about the 2.9 release, is that what you're talking about?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In the fourth quarter, right.","Karen Silva","Yes. So in the Q1, we had a small release related to -- it was $1.4 million related to the 2.9 iTero program that we launched in the beginning of this quarter, and we do not foresee to run that program again, and we'll not have any additional onetime hits with that as well.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one for you, Tom. And I'm sorry, I saved the hard one for you. It's -- we're in a bit of an air pocket here between now and the time that we hear from the ITC. I appreciate it's a tough topic, but I wonder if there's anything you could say to help us and the investment community broadly just dimension what the commentary from the ITC means, how we should think about the process over the next couple of months and then over the longer term.","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, certainly, we can't predict the future, but our team is extremely prepared for any scenario. We are -- we certainly expect that we will prevail based on all of our insight and everything we've done. We believe the law is on our side and the facts are on our side. So with that said, we're prepared for the best case scenario, something in between and the worst case scenario. And this, we have a lot more -- if the worst case scenario were to happen, it's not our expectation, we have a lot of things we can go do, including putting our activity back in Texas back on. I guess maybe to pile on a little bit, I've Roger sitting right here, he actually is still a lawyer besides acting as our CFO. And maybe Roger, do you want to put some dimension to that?","Roger E. George","Steve, one simple thing to remind everybody of is that the remedy that is available at the ITC as a forum is exclusion from the domestic market. So the judge's determination that we will get on May 6 will tell us whether he thinks, based on the case, that ClearCorrect infringes our patent and because of that, should be excluded from the domestic market. That's what we're waiting to hear. Now that's what the judge thinks. There is a period of time after the judge's decision is published where the side that loses has the opportunity to appeal to the entire commission, the ITC itself. And the time for all of those appeals processes to run doesn't end until September. So as Tom said, we're prepared for any situation that might start with the judge's ruling. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ruling will be in our favor and that ClearCorrect will be excluded from the domestic market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe the first, and maybe I can squeeze in 3. But if we can just talk on the revenue recognition or what you talked about on the course correction. So you reported $0.26 non-GAAP. You took a $2.7 million deduction, if you would. Is it fair to say -- I mean, relative to where we were and where you guided, that is $0.28 to $0.29, if you go ahead and add that back? That's part one of the question. So can we start there, and you can answer that?","Roger E. George","The answer is yes.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then can you talk about 2Q, where I just want to be clear, because there was a lot of comments, but I don't think it was clear -- going forward, 2Q will be a $700,000 hit. And if that's the case, why is it $700,000 and not the $2.7 million that you experienced in 1Q?","Roger E. George","So the $700,000 is the amount of revenue that we will not book because we're not going to be charging for midcourse correction. For the $700k is just that, lost revenue. The revenue guidance that we've given you, of course, has the deferral for future pre-midcourse corrections built into it.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, maybe we can take this offline. But my last one, just to clarify, is why was the hit $2.7 million in 1Q and yet I believe you're saying your hit in Q2 will be $700k?","Roger E. George","All right. Go ahead, Karen.","Karen Silva","Jonathan, so the $2.7 million is related to open cases. We're grandfathering in all those cases that are open to allow for midcourse correction.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","There you go, that's the answer. The changes, the goodwill impairments for 3 quarters in a row unfortunately just make people not focus on the fundamentals of the story, which has actually been very solid. But that's the frustration. And then the second one, Tom, is on the interoperability or possibility of one with other scanners, that was the first time I've actually heard you float that it's possible. So can you maybe elaborate a bit? You've written down all the goodwill. What are you seeing with the guys that have a scanner, and are they doing more Invisalign? And does that make you much more receptive to possibly entering into an agreement with another scanner company?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, given your less than wonderful setup about the goodwill, we have to separate, and we're responsible for good accounting. I'm going to pull apart, as we think about the business going forward, our ability to create economic value, which very much still exists as we think about the benefits over time aside from the reality of dealing with a softening outlook in the near to midterm, which we've got do to deal with in terms of our accounting processes. So I understand it's not what we'd like to be able to report, but we're going to deal with that reality. Moving forward, we know that scanning at the front end of the process is going to be a very valuable part of Invisalign going forward. You can see from roughly a 200 basis point per quarter increase on our iTero scanners alone what's going on with our own base. And all of the effects are positive there. So as we see the ability to move high-value applications like the outcome stimulator out to those kinds of platforms, we've known for a long time that if other potential scanner platforms could be made to work what we believe is the most demanding application in dentistry today, it's not a quadrant or individual tooth, even for surgical cases, this is full-arch, interproximal space, gingival margins, everything in detail, all having to be very accurate put together. That's been a very hard job for anybody else's scanner, which is one of the things that led us to Cadent in the first place. At the time, they were only scanner that even had a shot. So with that said, I would say from a strategic perspective, we're open-minded about considering some other scanners. But I'm not going to talk in more detail about what that path might look like or what the implications might be because it is an R&D project to consider, evaluate and ]qualify such a thing, and again, when there's news to report, we will do so.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And last question, if I could just slip it in. Is there any reason why you guys were light on the share repo this quarter? Is it something where you're aggressive in the high 20s but you sort of take your foot off the gas in the low 30s?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, I guess we have a policy of, as a company, of open-window periods. And during this open-window period, the company was evaluating impairment, and we felt it constrained us from acting on any share repurchases. The same is exactly for board buybacks or sales. So I'll just say it that way. We've been consistent in the way we look at that policy.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just to dig in a little bit to the ASP trend. This quarter, you were down a bit year-over-year. In the fourth quarter. You were up a bit from a longer term perspective, what is your current about how the ASP will trend? I assume it's down, but could you maybe size that for us?","Thomas M. Prescott","We've actually been doing some internal modeling, John, to answer that same question. I guess we're not ready to put it out there yet. But if I could, I would expect that it's probably going to go down a bit over time. And I don't want to put tighter dimensions than that because separating everything else aside, we expect mix to play a bigger role over time with the large base of GP customers in North America and price sensitivity around the world for simple cases. So that'll -- but in our view, that's a positive reason for average ASP to go down. We certainly have FX that gives and takes on a quarterly basis, but we usually speak to FX at a high level, so you can kind of back into what that might be. We're playing around the idea of putting out like a net adjusted ASP because there's puts and takes. We've added some new complexities, certainly, with midcourse correction pricing and those kinds of policy changes, change -- have some movement on ASP over time. But in general, because of mix and because of advantage, widening advantage programs, which we look at as a positive, and to a lesser extent promotions, we think pricing will be stable but will probably drift down a bit over time. Separate aside from onetime events where we might change policies like warranty or something like that.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up. The advantage rebate in particular, have you adjusted any of the terms of that, or do you expect to as you go through the year?","Thomas M. Prescott","We consider looking at that all the time. We would certainly always reserve the right to do that. But we -- if anything, we're beefing up the value in that program, what it means to be Elite, Super Elite and Premier and making sure that value proposition is even better. We've not adjusted, to date, any of the pricing terms, numbers or anything else.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then finally, very impressive growth in the Express product line. If that continues, what -- does that have a negative impact, margin impact on your operating margin?","Thomas M. Prescott","No, if we had to stack up kind of in an activity-based cost model for our go-to-market, it's considered kind of gravy. Not a lot of effort go to those cases. These are -- in general, these are customers that have more experience with the product. So for them to go 5-stage case, it's really a scenario for them where a patient is probably declining full treatment and it may be right now for price. And they're saying, well, how about considering just a minor correction for $1,200 or $1,500. And the patient says, great. They were going to walk out and do nothing; instead, they're going to do something. Oftentimes, the conversations we're hearing may very well lead them to full treatment down the road with that doc. So our cost of that setup are roughly the same as any other case would be, and so our margins shouldn't be any worse.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Tom, where do we stand in terms of incremental sales force expansion plans that you had for the year? I believe it was a 10% increase or so off the 200 base.","Thomas M. Prescott","We're right on track with that. Our goal was to make sure they were in and running well before the end of the first half, and I think -- I'm looking at Shirley for a second. I'm not sure if that'll be updated in our Q filing here for our sales force, but it probably will be. So won't give the numbers now, but if you look in the Q in a few weeks, you'll probably see the latest kind of roster numbers.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And  then just an update on where we stand in terms of the CFO search?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes, good question. Well, I will say in the interim, Roger and Karen and other members of our outstanding finance team are doing a great job, and not a surprise to me, but they're doing a great job for us. We are see some real good talent. We're -- and I'm comfortable that process is progressing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, I just wanted to follow up with you on some of the comments around ClearCorrect from earlier in the call. I'm just kind of curious, assuming that the court decision ultimately goes in your favor, it seems like a pretty greenfield, pretty sizable greenfield opportunity. Is it your sense that those dentists that are using that competing product, that's all they use? And so presumably, that would be some really easy market opportunity for you to gain relatively quickly? And if you kind of agree with that, I'm also kind of curious on the negative side, I know you're not assuming it, but let's just say, for example, the binary event is somewhat negative. I mean, how do you ultimately react from something like that from a competitive perspective? And does anything really change?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes, I want to be careful, a, not to speculate about what happens with customers and market and stuff like that, and b, I'd rather not speculate about either a good or bad outcome. The simple fact is we think roughly a year ago, they were taking a little bit of share. With think a lot of it was driven by Groupon, and they've kind of changed their model a bit where they've gone back more to a lab-based model, and I don't think they have a sales force really in place of much sorts right now. But they're working very hard and doing the best they can to make it, and we think we've retaken the share we believe we had lost. And if you look at Express 5, Express 10, it's hitting a price point where we're -- forget ClearCorrect for a moment. There's a lot of little labs producing 5-, 6-, 7-stage cases for doctors. I think that's the greenfield opportunity, more so than ClearCorrect. Again, I want to be very thoughtful about not thinking too far ahead with that or not thinking about scenarios. But we think the bigger opportunity is to engage the wider slice of dentistry over time for simple cases that are easy to do and are very clear and straightforward about what that patient -- what treatment that patient will end up with. So there's an awful lot out there, and over time, we hope to get at it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe if I could just ask you a follow-up question, then. You obviously talked about taking the Asia Pac team back in-house here in the next couple of weeks. It sounds like you are on target for that. Have you -- could you give us a little bit more details in terms of, do you think that will enhance your ability to accelerate the revenue growth in that market? And what does that -- can you give us some -- a little bit more clarity in terms of what that's going to do to your cost structure?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, it certainly, we wind up -- as we said, we've kind of been front-running some OpEx as a way to transition this product. It's technically an acquisition, but very, very small. And the reality is we've been bridging -- without having control of the business, we've been bridging some OpEx support so that instead of kind of stepping back away, knowing there was an endpoint, the ownership could continue to build the business. And we've been bridging some of those customer events and those kind of things that were all agreed upon in advance. So we've already had some OpEx pressure and headwind as early as Q4 last year and into Q1, which we spoke about but didn't give dimensions to. We'll pick up that entire cost structure May 1, and over some months, I think, will be very comfortable that the volume will start to cover that. If you go back to our last annual report where we had a diagram, I think, Shirley, the number was 3% for our...","Shirley Stacy","In 2011.","Thomas M. Prescott","In 2011 for our distributor geographies, just mapping this, that number would now -- doubling the revenue would be, taking out Asia Pacific, would be about 6% of the international. So I think it's going to double that overnight, and we're pretty comfortable that the contribution margins will work themselves out within a couple of months. But I think the bigger thing is we have an opportunity to leverage skills and experience across Asia where, in general, they're treating far more complex cases. And we're pretty excited about the quality of the Pan Asia team with a very small team based in Singapore, right perfectly the middle. So I think that's the opportunity, and I think we can leverage what's going on so well with these distributors with what we've done well and China and Japan direct. And over time, as I think I indicated, this can become a much more significant contributor to our long-term growth.","Operator","We do have time for one last question. Our last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Matthews from RAM Partners.","Jeffrey Matthews - RAM Partners, L.P.","I wanted to follow up quickly on that last question and then switch to Spain and Italy. But have you learned anything about Asia Pacific and the opportunities there that you weren't fully aware of now that you're getting into it, or is it hands-off until May 1?","Thomas M. Prescott","In terms of -- well, first of all, we've been Asia for 5 years very quietly. Longer than that, 8.5 in Japan and 5 years in China, although we didn't have a -- because we actually set up our -- started setting up our entity in China that long ago, filing IP, et cetera. In terms of our distributor geographies, we've been very, very thoughtful and careful about everything you can imagine. And there's nothing new we've learned, and we've been -- this is as friendly a process as you can imagine, with a lot of contact with the entire -- it's a small team in total, but a lot of contact with the entire team, including all of our regulatory and compliance people, our sales leadership now with a very experienced medical device executive right there ensuring that we go do all the right things in all the right ways. But our -- when I say that a clear learning for us has less to do with the distributor team and more to do with the excitement from the customer base that they're going to be working directly with the company again, that'll just make it easier to get things done. And they are -- again, in Asia, they treat the most complex cases in the world. We have a -- I think we have 1 doctor in Japan treating a 93-stage case, which is headed towards 4 years of treatment. So they are very excited about the evolution of technology, and I think being able to more directly engage with them is going to help us accelerate their adoption. So I think we've got some work to do there. There'll be plenty more to report. But that is going to be -- that's going to be a good journey for all of us.","Jeffrey Matthews - RAM Partners, L.P.","And then if I could just ask, I'm just intrigued by -- you're doing well in calling out Spain and Italy. What is it? Is it a good sales team? Is it -- what is it about the product or its evolution or the lifetime right now that's making you do well in an area that's so economically depressed?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, it sounds like you're actually there trying to keep the economy going, Jeff. If I heard correctly, you're in Italy. So the reality is we have very, very small penetration, and there's still a fairly significant population that cares about aesthetics and about function. We see this in Germany, we see this in the U.K, we see this in Spain and Italy. And even in areas where there's real severe austerity and challenges that you can see, there are people with wealth that want a healthier and more beautiful smile, and we're tapping into that. The more we can, in a cost-effective way, engage directly with a consumer, and there are different rules in every country around medical devices and consumer marketing, the more effective we'll be at creating demand. And we're just starting to scale that now. So I think over time, and goodness, with any improvement at all in the economy in Europe, we should we be able to continue to do well.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Jeff. Well thanks, everyone.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and Q3 results that exceed our expectations across our key financial metrics including revenue, volumes, margins and EPS. Our Q3 revenues increased 38.3% year-over-year driven by increase Invisalign volumes across all of our geographies as well as strong growth from our scanners. Our strong Q2 results also reflect accelerate growth from teenagers in both North America and Asia Pacific with total Invisalign shipments to team up 46.3% year-over-year and up 26.5% in Q2. ","On sequential basis revenues increased 8.1% driven by continued strength across Asia Pacific which offset expected seasonality in Europe as well as higher than expected revenues from shipments [as record]. For North America, Q3 Invisalign case volume was down 1.1% sequentially reflecting a decrease in GP dentist channel due to less patient traffic and fewer days in the office from the summer holidays. ","In addition, as result of the devastation caused by hurricane Harvey and Irma, we estimate that our North American volumes are lower by approximately 1,500 cases in Q3 and mostly adults. These declines were partially offset by strong growth from the ortho channel, specially teens. ","On the year-over-year basis North America was up 25% reflecting strong growth from the ortho channel, driven by an increase in team patients and in Invisalign express life products. ","Q3 in Invisalign volume for international doctors is up 6.8% sequentially, driven primarily by Asia Pacific region, which offset expected summer seasonality declines in EMEA. On year-over-year basis Invisalign volume was up 47.4% reflecting strong growth from both APAC and EMEA. ","In EMEA, Q3 volumes were up 37.6% year-over-year lead by our core European markets particularly Spain, UK and France. We also saw strong growth across all of our smaller expansion markets, which includes central and eastern Europe, Benelux, Middle East and Africa, the Nordics and Russia. ","In APAC Q3 volumes were up 57.4% year-over-year with record Invisalign across all country markets led primarily by China, Q3 marked the first quarter in which China was our second largest market in the world behind United States. Our asset customer base in APAC is almost triple year-over-year with over 1500 [doctors to entered] in Q3 mostly within China. ","Turning to the teen market, over 698,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners in Q3, up 26.5% sequentially and 46.3% year-over-year, reflecting a very strong summer teen season and accelerating growth rates. North American ortho teen cases increased 22.9% sequentially and 43.6% year-over-year reflecting our continued efforts to drive adoption of teenage patients through sales initiatives and our direct-to-consumer campaign emphasizing teens and mom. ","For international Q3 teen cases increased 36.7% sequentially and 65.7% year-over-year driven by accelerated growth across the APAC regions primarily led by China. The introduction of Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement is helping to raise visibility for Invisalign treatment of teenagers and contributed to some of the growth in the APAC region.","We call the Invisalign treatment of mandibular advancement is the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction that advances the mandibular while moving teeth at the same time. Mandibular advancement is intercooled to increasing teen adoption. Approximately 30% to 45% of teen cases globally need Class II correction. Based on early indications we are seeing a positive correlation between those customers who use our mandibular advancement feature and the increased teen utilization. ","One example is [Dr. Lethic] in Canada, who has seen the benefits of switching from an analog to digital method of orthodontist not just with mandibular advancement but with Invisalign treatment in general. With the launch of mandibular advancement and because of the renewed commitment to being fully digital in phasing out the use of metal braces [Dr. Lethic] has started 162 patients in Invisalign treatment since Q2 '17. Of those 120 were teenagers and 24 were treated with mandibular advancement features. This is compared to only 3 Invisalign patients in 2016 and only 1 Invisalign case in the first quarter of this year. That's an amazing transformation of [Dr. Lethic's] business and speaks towards the impact of digital growth for patients. Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement is not available in the United States yet, as it's currently pending FDA approval. ","Our consumer marketing programs continue increased demand for Invisalign's treatment and our key to adoption in both the teen and adult segments. Each year we invest millions in consumer advertising and social and media campaigns to raise awareness, create preference and help consumers to find an Invisalign practice near them. ","In 2017, we increased our investment in consumer marketing by 60%, which we believe is contributing to our strong growth. But despite our efforts most of the consumers interested in Invisalign's treatment still end up in metal braces or don\u2019t start any type of orthodontic treatment at all. This is phenomena isn\u2019t new and we've been working through years to identify gaps like these and develop solutions that turn more consumers into Invisalign patients for our customers. ","In January, we launched a new consumer capture program with a Smile Concierge team enrolling with Carolina whose goal is to reach more consumers one-on-one and ensures that anyone that contacts us directly has the best experience with Invisalign brand beginning to end. Our Smile Concierge service educates consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment, answers their questions and help them to schedule an appointment and Invisalign providers from our next level partnerships listed as DIT on Invisalign.com.locator. The team also follows up with consumers through digital apps and email to find out whether they keep their appointment and start Invisalign treatment. It's really existing to see how something as simple as direct personal touch has resulted in such positive response from our consumers and adopters. ","The team received incredible feedback from consumers every day, who appreciate the white glove service we provide which is translating into shorter research cycles for the average consumer interested in the Invisalign treatment and a win-win for Align, our customers and consumers. Over the past 10 months our Smile Concierge team have contacted 50,000 consumers, who took a smile assessment on Invisalign.com and scheduled 20,000 consultations with nearly 800 Invisalign practices across the U.S. ","Today 5000 have already started treatment within an Invisalign provider which equates to millions of dollars in revenue through Invisalign practices and we're just getting started. Our new Smile Concierge service is not only helping turn more consumers into Invisalign patients, we're also learning a lot about consumer conversion. For example, convenience and speed of contact are critical to conversion. If we can't schedule an appointment for consumers see a doctor within 72 hours mean they can't get on to the doctor's schedule within three days, the likelihood of that consumer converting to Invisalign patient drops by 40%. ","On top of that for the consumers that get scheduled for a consultation, 65% of them cites financial concerns as the reason don\u2019t start treatment with 25% of them stating that a high down payment in the practice is the main barriers of acceptance. With that in mind as part of our smile concierge service, we just launched a patient financing pilot, that address consumer financing concerns as well as insurance coverage for orthodontic treatment. In developing this project, it's important for us to find the solutions that offers consumers the ability to customize their own down payment, monthly payment and interest rate in a way that can fit into any budget. ","Equally important is providing an end to end digital workflow for both the consumer and the doctor and with our new third-party financer partner, we\u2019ve done just that. When consumers finance their treatment through us and Invisalign providers no longer pay Align, instead they just receive payment for the treatment fee minus Align's lab fee. By changing the financial relationship between the patient, Align and the provider, Invisalign treatment become a revenue source for the provider and eliminates the needs for them to pass on the high down payments to patients. ","Finally, we've also learned what\u2019s important for consumers when it comes to choosing Invisalign practice and digital technology really matters. As part of the smile concierge referral process consumers are offered the top three Invisalign practices in their areas and it turns out that the iTero scanner is one of the key influencers. While this isn\u2019t surprising to us, it is important to be able to validate another example of digital technology like our iTero inner oral scanner replacing an old analog process like PVS impressions. ","With that let\u2019s review the results for the iTero business. Q3 was a strong quarter for iTero and better than expected with revenues up 25% year-over-year on record iTero scanner shipments. The iTero scanner is central to restore the workflows and key to our GP strategy. In Q3, we saw a nice uptake by GP dentist with record contracts out of GP summit September. Q2 results also reflect the initial uptake of iTero scanner from its first commercial availability in Japan as well as from our new distribution agreement with Paterson Dental in United States and Canada. ","Use of the iTero scanners from Invisalign case submission in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remained a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North American increased to a record 61.9% up from 48.8% in Q3 of last year. Overall, we continue to be excited about the long-term potential for at home doctor directed market and are pleased with our equity investment and supply agreement with SmileDirectClub. ","For Q3 in aligner shipments to SmileDirectClub or SDC were higher than expected and more than doubled sequentially reflecting continued strong volume growth as well as a shift to Align manufacturing more of SDCs aligners than what SDC internally produces. As SDC's is exclusive third partly supplier this quarter we produced about two thirds of the Clear aligner volume as compared to only one third in the prior two quarters. While this shift was not anticipated our world class manufacturing operations can accommodate changes in SDCs order flow easily. We are pleased that we are able to support their continued rapid growth.","With that, I'll now turn it over to John.","John Morici","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total company revenue for the third quarter was a record $385.3 million, up 8.1% from the prior quarter and up 38.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago.","Clear aligner revenue up $341.6 million was up 6.4% sequentially, and higher than expected volume and variable foreign exchange rates as well as increased revenue from shipments to SEC. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth, of 40.2%, reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, increased Invisalign prices and revenue from shipments to SDC. ","Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $25 from Q2 to $1,310 reflecting favorable foreign exchange, a favorable shift in our product mix and price increases partially offset by increased promotional discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were also up $25, reflecting price increases, an increase in additional aligner revenue, favorable foreign exchange partially offset by increased promotional discounts.","For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of [236.1000] cases were up 1.8% sequentially, driven primarily by our Asia Pacific doctors and North American orthodontists. Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was up 32.8%, driven by growth across all regions, as well as expansion of our customer base, priced predominantly from Asia Pacific.","For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 1.8% sequentially and up 31.9% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 5.2% sequentially and up 15.9% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.8% sequentially and up 47.4% year-over-year.","Our Scanner & Services revenue for the third quarter was $43.7 million, up 23.2% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued investment in go-to-market activities in APAC and EMEA, as well as the initial uptick of the iTero Scanner from its first commercial availability in Japan.","Moving onto gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, down 0.1 point sequentially and up 0.8 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 77.9%, down 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to an increase in aligners per case driven by additional aligners, partially offset by higher Clear aligner ASPs. Clear aligner gross margins was up 0.2 year-over-year primarily due to leveraging our manufacturing costs over higher volumes. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 60%, up 3.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs. Scanner segment gross margin was up 2.9 points year-over-year, primarily a result of lower service costs. ","Q3 operating expenses were $193.7 million, up sequentially by $6.4 million or 3.4%, primarily related to increased global head count. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up 31.7%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in our go-to-market activities critical to the growth of our business.","Our third quarter operating margin was 25.6%, up 2.2 points sequentially and up 3.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to increased clear aligner volume. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenue and lower cost per case partially offset by increased head count and higher marketing expenses. ","With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 17.9%, which includes $1.7 million in excess tax benefit and is down by approximately 0.5 points compared to 18.4% in the same quarter last year. Primarily due to 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-9 which requires access tax benefits related to stock based compensation we recognized as a reduction to tax expense and certain one-time tax charges encored in the prior year from implementing our new international corporate tax structure. The revenue and cost to supply aligner small direct club are included in our operating profit and reported results. ","Additionally, we report our share of SmileDirectClub's losses below operating margin and our tax provision, and is entitled Equity and Losses of Investee, net of tax. Our share of SSE loss net of tax in Q3 was approximately $1.6 million decreasing our diluted earnings per share by $0.02. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.01 up 18.8% sequentially and up 60.3% compared to prior year. ","Moving onto the balance sheet, as of the third quarter cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $739.9 million. This compared to $676.6 million at the end of Q2, an increase of approximately $61.3 million, primarily related to earnings growth. Of our $737.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $236.3 million was held by the U.S. and $501.6 million was held by our international entities.","Q3 accounts receivable balance was $321.3 million, up approximately 10.2% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 75 days, up 1 day sequentially and down 3 days from 78 days in Q3 last year. We anticipate that our DSOs will continue to decline over the next few quarters.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $118.1 million, up $58.3 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $70 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $48.1 million, primarily relating to building improvements purchases and improvement, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity as well as our global expansion efforts. ","During the third quarter, we concluded our previously announced $50 million accelerated stock repurchase. We received a total of 0.4 million shares under the ASR, at a weighted average share price of $146.48. We have 250 million for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization.","With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For our international, we expect Invisalign volume to be up from Q3 as EMEA customers return from seasonally slower summer holidays, partially offset by a slight decreased in the APAC as the greater China market observes the golden week holiday. For North America, we expect Invisalign volume to be up sequentially reflecting the seasonally stronger quarter, partially offset by some lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.","For our scanner business, we expect slight sequential increases but in a typical strong end of the year demand for capital equipment. Q4 sequential growth reflects the benefits from orders taken at our North America GP Summit in Q3 and global expansion. As Joe commented earlier, this quarter we produced two thirds of SEC aligners. However, we expect our aligner shipments to SEC to be down sequentially in anticipation of a production ship back to their own internal manufacturing. ","With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 245,000 to 250,000 cases, up approximately 29% to 32% over the same period a year ago.","We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $391 million to $398 million, an increase of approximately 33% to 36% year-over-year. We expect Q4 gross margins to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%, reflecting higher ASPs, partially offset by higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning operations. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $198 million to $202 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investments in go-to-market activities.","Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. Our effective tax rate, including an excess tax benefit of about $1 million, should be approximately 22%. We expect a $1.5 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.9 million, inclusive of any share repurchases.","Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q4 to be approximately $55 million to $60 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10.5 million to $11 million. ","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph Hogan ","Thanks, John. We're pleased with the performance the business and feel good about the overall momentum and strength of aligner. ","With that we will open up the call for any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Jones ","A very big step up in ASP, John you touched on some of the factors that affect mixing and pricing increase but it does look like that you're calling for this is to be sustainable through the end of the year. So, I was may be hoping if you could just talk about the drivers and I guess may be specifically, mix and the pricing increases where I will be most interested in what's driving that why you think that looks like it will hold at least through the end of this year. ","Joseph Hogan","Good question, you're right we did see some mix benefits with some volume that came through Asia, so that helps up from overall stand point we saw some FX favorability that came in this quarter. As you noted we have price increases that is in our numbers as well, partially offset by some discounting, so netted altogether we feel that for fourth quarter, flat to slightly down in Q3. ","Robert Jones ","Okay I got it and then I guess just on the patient financing interesting new wrinkle, Joe was hoping maybe you could talk about the opportunity there. Any data or survey work you guys have done that might help us get ahead around how many people actually may be go to doc locator or go to see a doctor about perusing Invisalign but ultimately don\u2019t elect to do the treatment because of cost. Might help us frame, how this might help the opportunity there.","Joseph Hogan","About two questions, we don\u2019t have any real statistics to tell you, how many people going doc locator and but we could tell you, from our consumer capture efforts and we talked about this concierge service, this is one of the big items that consumers have to deal with, often orthodontists also ask for a large down payment upfront too that even if a customer can avoid credit, it's still a pretty hit from a cash standpoint upfront. ","We think this will be a good factor for us and helping to bring more consumers into Invisalign but we don\u2019t have any statistics right now to tell you exactly what that might be, I would say just stay with us and as we go through this we will able to give you more and more specific on it. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Two from me on the same basic concept and it's about the trajectory of investment in the business. I have to imaging you feel happy on the marketing expense trajectory and on the efforts in Asia that these have paid off, as well as they have, and you give you couple of interesting statistics on, I think it was growth and marketing spend and something like a tripling of the customer base and I believe that was a broader Asia. ","Could you talk about one, how you think about the growth of marketing spend and the commercial team from here and then two, a similar question, more specific to Asia, how you think about the remaining runway for customer acquisition, considering how much success you have a much you probably learned about how things are working there. ","Joseph Hogan","Steve, so on the marketing spend, I would just way we just continue to do what we can in a sense of driving volume. There is no formulating methodology we have here, we mean obviously we focused on teens in a big way. In North America to get a look that we had. That spend also has been I think really refined in the sense of how much of social media, how much goes to some other segment how much go to the team that have done, so I feel there is the lot of accuracy and sophistication in a sense of how we go about it. ","But we do know that we had a pretty big signal in the sense of being able to spend more of in that channel and see an increase in orders and we will keep spending where we can. I think a broader question in that and I believe then your second one is how we do this oversees too. North America a lot of our marketing dollars, our teams were focused in the third quarter in the second quarter also. But we look at translating what we are learning here in the United States oversees and we've had a pretty good response from a teen standpoint in China also and now we have some restrictions in the sense of how you can advertise in certain geographies and we have to be compliant in that sense but we will be smart in the sense of how we use as advertising dollars. ","From an Asia runway standpoint, I mean we talk about going wide in the business you saw we train another 1,000 docs overall in China for the quarter. There is a direct correlation in the sense of being able to train those docs and we see the increase in orders going forward. ","Remember our penetration rates in places like in China are still relatively thin when you think about the available population. Also, India, we are really just getting started in Korea and Taiwan. In Australia we saw terrific growth there too and that's a market that we've have had fairly good penetration rates and over the years and so there is different formulas we have to use for different geographies in the sense of adding sales people, adding docs, like in Australia it's a different deal in the sense of it is more like North America where it's advertising a specificity where you spend from a sales standpoint that helps in that way. But I know I'm not helping you a lot Steven in the sense of being able to model that, but tell you that we obviously watch as closely, we want to invest in the sense of where we get the biggest return and we do watch that part also.","Unidentified Analyst ","If I could just sneak one housekeeping item. I wonder if you have any updates on timelines in the U.S. for mandibular advancement and for iGo?","Joseph Hogan","On mandibular advancement we expect to hear back from the FDA in December sometime and that's all we know. It's like that when you do that, you submit your data and then basically the FDA kind of goes behind closed doors and kind of works through it but we feel we have submitted good data and we will just wait and see what happens in December.","And now from an iGo standpoint remember we keep better rating on iGo and in different parts and different geographies in the sense of the product itself and how that interacts with the doc and the patient and we've had -- we continue to do well with that product line but you'll see more data on that on iGo and as iGo success as we get into -- as we report the fourth quarter next year we have more specificity on that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John Kreger ","Joe, obviously the years split are very, very well in terms of volumes. Can you just talk about how the infrastructure is holding up? Are you starting to see any bottlenecks or choke points that could be challenges if the demand continues to be this strong?","Joseph Hogan","Obviously when you start to grow at this rate above what we've predicted, we've been able to stay ahead from the manufacturing standpoint we always go to certain amount of buffer capacity so we cover things like this. Initially we had a little bit of trouble in the sense of clean check and our people did actually do the clean check pieces but we experienced that back actually in January or so we adjusted to give us extra capacity for the year or so. ","Right now, we're in good shape, it's a good thing about this business in the sense we can adjust capacity pretty quickly within a certain number of weeks and months when we have this kind of things, but we're trying to anticipate and lay resources ahead of these things, so we don\u2019t get into a situation where we can't handle demand. ","John Kreger ","Great thank you and then, may be any early thought on 2018 and sort of key puts and takes, for example should we think about the storms here in North America as may be causing you to start more slowly or may be giving you a little bit of pent up demand as you move into next year. ","Joseph Hogan","I wouldn\u2019t call the storms material at all, I probably wouldn\u2019t even consider that in your accusation. And right now, we kind of talk about this, we anticipate there will 2018 questions but we have good momentum now you can see us going into fourth quarter. And I think John has given you some really strong indications of where the fourth quarter is going to be and so we try to be as specific as we could to help in that sense but we are really not ready to get into conjecture on 2018 at this point. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. ","Jonathan Block ","May just a first one, the international case volume there was tremendous, notably APAC. You mentioned the train docs and that was certainly big, but is some of that drill also due to the local treatment planning facility that just opened up or is arguably that even too soon to be yielding benefits and that so might be on the come in subsequent quarters. ","Joseph Hogan","I would say right now that I won't call any extra volume right now John associated with those, in fact we discussed that from -- we were in Germany, just last week to take a look at our [indiscernible] facility we opened up in Cologne there and honestly, it's just starting to ramp up, the initial indications, like just like in China these are really good, they interface well with customers, the teams there are very excited in sense of what they can do. Just getting closer to those customers and being in that geography from a cultural and timeframe standpoint is really critical, so that really hasn\u2019t impacted volume yet, but we will give a report as we get into next year and this becomes a little more mature. I mean we obviously put that in there because we think, mid -term longer term, this is going to a volume driver for us. ","Jonathan Block ","Got it, actually you just answered the question with the very last statement. That\u2019s perfect. And then just to shift gears, patient financing pilot, I want to make sure I got my arms on this correctly, so the doc gets the treatment fees, less Align's lab fee. So are you guys the one taking on the financing risk and if so, should we think about it as a potential long-term tailwind to sort of your realized ASP offset by what could be sort of the theoretical bad debt expense on the consumer, may be if you can just talk through that. Thanks guys. ","John Morici ","No, it\u2019s a third party that would take on any of the financing sort of bad debt, or anything out that comes with this would be third party, it would not be associated with us at all. ","Jonathan Block ","Okay so zero impact to your ASP. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon team, this is Kevin on for Matt today, thanks for taking the time. I wanted to take a moment on iTero which seems to be the focus for this year and beyond and with record shipments, I'm just curious, how you're looking at the trends for case submissions and the broader strategy on the ground for iTero, seems like a bigger piece than we previously anticipated.","I know you mentioned -- and the second part of the question, as I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the lower patient traffic in summer holidays. Just wanted to reconcile the sales effort on the scanners and the GP offices and kind how does that relate to the lower volume in the quarter. It seems a bit of a mismatch.","Joseph Hogan","You remember last year Tim we were shipping a lot from backlog on the volume piece. What you are seeing this year is a pure demand signal there is nothing really coming out of backlog. So, I think if you are talking about that discrepancy that's the one I'd other point out. ","On your broader question on the volume of the business I think it's important for you to understand that when we talk about sales last year of iTero, its broadly an North American business. What we're seeing now we're seeing an increase uptick in Europe, we just approved in Japan, we had significant semantic shipments in Japan in the third quarter also and we'll move into Asia broadly into more next year. I say the business is just getting broader internationally and that adds to the volume also. ","But in the United States I hear in your comments that I think you understand that we've have a really good amount of orthodontic penetration with iTero, and more and more of our sales are moving into GPs and so that's one of the reasons we put together the Patterson dental distribution agreement because of their strong position with GPs and help us through so we have some work to do on restore the workflow in areas like that to be more viable in that channel but we've got a really good pickup and we are enthusiastic about the future in North American channel for GPs too.","Unidentified Analyst ","I mean the second question kind of comes from China. I think a few folks touched on this to just wanted to discuss just the utilization trends in that market and the strategy that's kind of done differently there that you would highlight versus the rest of the international markets. Is there anything on the grounds that I am missing driving this or is it just continued adoption training and utilization as you would expect?","Joseph Hogan","Continual adoption, training and utilization just as you described it Kevin. I wish I could make it sound harder and more sophisticated but it's about getting resources in place and moving it through. Now you know we just put up a treatment planning facility in China and that's really, they are ramping up well we are getting good customers feedback and so you know we will continue to do more and more resources to enhance that position in China in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Wright","Just as a follow-up on sort of the Scanners. I guess what sort of traction are you seeing for kind of standalone I guess versus sort of the closed architecture systems just given sort of the distribution shift that we've been seeing kind of in the U.S. and is there stocking dynamics that we should be considering here in near term? Thanks.","John Morici ","I missed that question, can you rephrase the question?","Erin Wright","iTero.","John Morici ","Yes, I know that\u2019s iTero, but it was underneath that. ","Unidentified Company Representative ","What do you mean by closed systems?","Erin Wright","Like closed architecture systems involving like [Indiscernible].","Joseph Hogan","You mean like a Scarano system. [indiscernible] But Scarano they are capable of doing a scan and sending it into us and you can bypass them and an impress them with a Scarano Scanner. You can't necessarily get stimulation and lot of visualization and things that we offer on the iTero side. Does that answer -- and then you talk about did you, you talk about capacity on iTero or\u2026","Erin Wright","Yes, or any sort of stocking with just your relationships there that we should be\u2026.","John Morici ","I understand what you mean. No nothing like the Patterson, Scarano thing, don\u2019t worry about any kind of stocking things affecting our numbers in a material way.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then can you give us an update on this SmileDirectClub and how's that sort of resonating with customers and how you weigh sort of that direct to consumer relationship with all those practitioners as well. Thanks. ","Joseph Hogan","I mean, our relationship with SmileDirectClub is good, we value, I think we\u2019re very synergistic in the sense of how we work with one another, remember those are SmileDirect customers, we don\u2019t see them, we don\u2019t really experience them we just do what SmileDirectClub asks us to do it. ","Obviously, part of your question is a lot of consternation in the orthodontic channel, about doctor directed and kind of systems that will be more of a digital dentistry, remote kinds of things where it's not involved in the doctor's office. Again, that\u2019s not us, we\u2019re not part of that, SmileDirectClub really controls that and holds it, so. ","I mean there is market for this, SmileDirectClub continues to do a great job in market and grow pretty substantially but it would be stupid to ignore that there is certain amount of consternation in the market place and a pushback but, I think SGC continues to do a great job out there. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. ","Richard Newitter ","I just wanted to start, your growth trajectory, it continues to accelerate, you're at a level, there is some pretty enormous year-over-year numbers here and I was just wondering if you could reflect a little bit upon, the age old question we always ask you balancing, driving future growth through the investment and dropping to the bottom line and as we kind think about, some of these marketing initiatives that are clearly being paying off, it sounds like you guys are probably at a point where it team's inflecting and you might want to dial over some of these initiatives and is that the way to think about it, you could be at a tipping point here, inflection point in adoption and you guys are going to put the gap total expense or how should we think about your growth for all the investment. ","Joseph Hogan","I'll just turn your attention to how underpenetrated we're in this market place, I mean its incredible right. globally we can do 60% to 70% of the orthodontic cases out there today, we have 8%. And so, a lot of the investment and things that we make, whether it's recruiting new doctors in China or its targeting moms and teens here in Untied States, it's about really driving the penetration that there is an entitlement in this business we should have based on what patients want and based on what our technology can deliver. ","I know there is always questions on leverage out there, our operating profits are over 25%, obviously was held by SGC this quarter, and its significant but we shown good leverages this quarter despite exchange and despite what I call unusual from an SGC standpoint. So, I would say we're getting some leverage in this business, but I don\u2019t expect kind of the material change in this sense of the input, output ratio of this business. We have to continue and invest aggressively in forward sales forces and marketing, especially in technology to stay ahead and to penetrate more to market place. We\u2019ve always said that our goal is 25% to 30% operating profit in this business. We could do that tomorrow if we wanted to, you wouldn't like the growth numbers. Now we're getting close to that lower end and we keep working that piece and we feel good about the tradeoffs that we are actually administrating right now between volume and margin. Does that make sense Richard?","Richard Newitter ","It makes a lot of sense and I think a number of investors would agree to it, that are striking the right balance and the trade of there. My second question is just on teens, can you break out a little bit the, continued acceleration that we're seeing in that category, I get a lot of it was held outside the U.S. but in North America what kind of attraction you're getting with the GP channel in teen obviously your orthodontic channels are a little more dominant there but are you starting to see some inflection on the GP side with that segment?","Joseph Hogan","With the GP segment in general I would say no, honestly, I would say I go helping us understand that more and I can tell you the GP segment in the U.S. is certainly different in the segment in Germany than it is in Japan, than it is in China and so each one of these countries kind of has a different solution that we have to work through whether its workflow or what preferences re whatever so. I will not say we are in an inflection point in all the GPs I would say we have a lot of growth. Teen growth for GPs not where they are focus, and so a lot of GPs only touch a teen, they are worried about working teen so that's not a -- and when we talk about teens we are really talking about all ortho channel utilization in the end.","Operator","Yes, and that question is coming from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson ","I'll try to be quick here as the last question so Joe I guess first question just why did we see the increase in SDC volumes in the third quarter? Was there a driver of that was there a reason behind that and why does it revert in the fourth quarter? Do we just kind of live with the little bit of volatility here going forward?","Joseph Hogan","I'll answer your last question first, you live with the volatility going forward Jeff okay. We don\u2019t control SmileDirectClub's decision making process. I'm not quite sure exactly why we receive that much more of SDCs volume but I don\u2019t count on that going forward and that's basically John's comments where in his opening remark. So, I wish I could more specific about it Jeff but I can't and it's just\u2026","Jeff Johnson","Should we at all bring that as a demand spike in the third quarter like all of the sudden volume came in stronger than they expected in the third quarter or do you think it was just them putting out some volume on you?","Joseph Hogan","Well, they continue to grow but I say it's a combination of both but it's not driven discreetly by volume I would say. ","Jeff Johnson","Yes, okay and my last question just on the fusion, the iTero fusion program you know you are locking GPs and it's some higher implied volumes there with that program just what's been the response to that program? Has that program taken off or is it taking off and how should we think about the implications for the GP numbers from that program going forward?","Joseph Hogan","I think again I have to move outside of North America in general, the biggest uptick in segments for fusion has been outside of North America, and it's been really received extremely well. In North America right now, we're really just getting cracked up on the fusion piece and we'll have more for you in the fourth quarter results, Jeff.","Shirley Stacy ","Well, thank you, everyone.

Tom?","Tom Prescott","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I\u2019ll provide some highlights from our first quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligner, and iTero scanner and services. I\u2019ll also provide some color on our orthodontist and GP dentist customers as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will then share more detail on our first quarter financials and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and then open the call to your questions.","We\u2019re pleased with our overall first quarter results with better than expected revenue and earnings. Record first quarter revenue increased nearly 18% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign volume. This solid growth reflects continued expansion of our customer base as well as increased adoption and utilization as doctors treat more patients with Invisalign. Despite numerous global economic challenges, our business remains strong with growth driven by continued progress in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions.","Our performance in Q1 reflects continued focused execution of our strategic plan including three key growth drivers which are; market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I will provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results.","First, market expansion, this strategic growth driver encompasses the many ways we are working to grow the adult treatment category, increase our share of teen treatment and in parallel open up new geographies.","In Q1, we continued targeted investments into our existing markets including North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region through a combination of sales coverage and support along with professional marketing in the clinical education programs. As mentioned during our January call, we are further expanding our directly covered markets in Europe by converting some of these countries previously managed by our EMEA distributor back to direct sales geographies.","In Q1, we began this process by brining Scandinavia, Portugal and Greece back in-house. While we don\u2019t expect to see immediate material impact from these markets, we are excited about their longer term potential and the opportunity to connect more directly with our customer base in those countries.","Our second growth driver is product innovation, which aims to create greater doctor preference through an intense focus on innovation and deliver increased adoption in utilization for our products. In Q1, we launched Invisalign G5 innovations for deep bite treatment worldwide. Deep bite is a very pervasive, functional orthodontic problem that presents in almost half of existing ortho case starts in North America and approximately a third of the case starts in Asia.","And while experienced doctors have been using Invisalign to treat deep bite for years. Invisalign G5 is designed to make treatment with Invisalign easier for our doctors and help them achieve even better clinical outcomes. Early indicators show a high level of enthusiasm around Invisalign G5.","We saw a record attendance at our Invisalign G5 launch event, with more than 4,000 doctors attending Invisalign G5 webinars in North America. And more than 1,800 doctors in the series of launch events in Europe and Asia.","And in the first couple of months post launch, we have seen both an initial increase in a number of doctors submitting deep bite cases, as well as in a number of deep bite cases started worldwide, with the greatest incremental growth coming from international orthos, which is not too surprising, as the doctors outside North America typically treat more complex cases.","We also began the phase launch of ClinCheck Pro with 3D controls in Q1. ClinCheck Pro is our latest software innovation that provides doctors with more precise control over final tooth position during treatment planning","Just 8 weeks into the launch, 83% of targeted doctors are using ClinCheck Pro. These early metrics for both Invisalign G5 and ClinCheck Pro thrown adoption give us confidence that we are delivering meaningful innovations to our customers.","And finally brand strength is our third key growth driver. Invisalign is the most recognizable brand in our industry and we continue to build equity in this valuable brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social networking and event marketing.","After what is typically a lighter Q4 in terms of media investment, Q1 saw an increase in North America media activity and delivered more than 1.2 million unique visitors to invisalign.com and year-over-year increases in all related activities on our consumer website. Extensive usage of social media and traditional PR continued to help enable meaningful discussions around Invisalign treatment leading to 53 million impressions from social media platforms just in Q1 alone.","While on a smaller scale in Europe, we continue to invest steadily in integrated consumer marketing campaigns in all major direct markets and are taking initial steps towards more significant PR and consumer programs in our Asia Pacific region. We have included more details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides.","In combination, these three proven strategic growth drivers are helping to extend growth in our strongest geographies while starting to tap into other meaningful growth opportunities around the world.","So now let\u2019s talk about how we did in Q1 by showing some customer and geographic highlights starting with North America.","For Q1, North America Invisalign was up sequentially from Q4 and up 9% year-over-year despite reduced patient traffic and fewer effective days in office as reported by a significant number of our customers who are affected by severe winter storms across the U.S. and Canada.","The sequential increase in Q1 primarily reflects growth from our North American orthodontists, while North American GP dentists were relatively unchanged from Q4. The year-over-year increase reflects expansion of our customer base as well as increased adoption and utilization among North American orthodontists.","In the teen market, which makes up the majority of the orthodontic treatments globally, we had a solid quarter and over 26,000 teenagers worldwide began treatment with Invisalign, up slightly from Q4 and consistent with fewer teen case starts that occurred during the winter months. The teen market remains one of the largest growth opportunities for Invisalign over the mid to long term and we continue to invest in enhancing product applicability to increase doctor confidence in teen treatment along with go to market initiatives and sales coverage and consumer programs to drive adoption.","For Q1 as anticipated, Invisalign case volume from international doctors in our EMEA Asia Pacific Regions decreased slightly on a sequential basis due to fewer days in the office from winter holidays in Europe, as well as the Lunar New Year period in Asia Pacific.","On a year-over-year basis, international volume increased 31%, reflecting strong growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific driven by go-to-market and sales coverage investments, ever improving clinical education and support, and excitement around new products like Invisalign G5. Taken together, these important steps increase doctor confidence in Invisalign treatment and lead the increased adoption.","In the EMEA region, Q1 Invisalign case volume was unchanged from Q4 and increased 24% year-over-year. Growth was driven by strong demand from orthodontists in our core country markets where we saw significant increases in France, Spain and Germany and in the UK where we are seeing continuing signs of recovery.","In Q1, Asia Pacific Invisalign case volume decreased slightly sequentially but increased 51% year-over-year with significant growth across all markets. Q1 was another good quarter for our scanner and services segment which was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum we had exiting last year continued into Q1 which resulted in better than expected scanner revenue.","Our scanner and services segment continues to benefit from leveraging our combined sales and marketing resources and taking full advantage of Invisalign and industry events such as the Chicago Midwinter Meeting in February.","We also further enhanced the functionality and flexibility of our iTero scanner for restorative procedures by announcing connectivity with ENTSPLY Implants Atlantis Custom Abutments which will help deliver a more optimal dental implant patient experience and outcome.","In a separate release today, we announced our new iTero 5.2 software upgrade. The iTero 5.2 upgrade is designed to increase practice efficiency and significantly expand the extensive array of iTero features currently available.","These enhancements will reduce total Invisalign scan time and a new Vivera pre-bonding feature will allow simulated digital removal of traditional wire and brackets for retention fitting prior to completion of orthodontic treatment. Commercial availability of the iTero 5.2 upgrade will begin in May of 2014.","We have included some more details in the iTero software upgrade in our webcast slides alongside this. A continued trend of digital dentistry leads to better back office integration, improved clinical workflows and greater use of intraoral scanning, setting up significant growth opportunities for our scanner business. The iTero scanners proven to be the best intraoral scanner with the greatest utility for customers and Align is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.","As of Q1 the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted in North America rose to 30.2% compared to 26.6% in Q4 and 19.4% in Q1 a year ago. We continue to support an open systems approach to digital impressions remain committed to working with other intraoral scanning companies, specifically by a way of enabling interoperability for use with Invisalign treatment. Our ultimate goal is to further build and strengthen the Invisalign franchise and while we\u2019re pleased to have one of the best scanners in the market with the most utility for our customers, that we\u2019re also continuing to do everything we can to create additional leverage for our Invisalign business.","It\u2019s in our strategic best interest to validate and qualify other third-party scanners and while have more news to report to you we\u2019ll be happy to update you.","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David for review of our Q1 financial results. David?","David White","Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. Also beginning this fiscal year we\u2019re consolidating some of the additional product and geographic breakdowns that we provide. We will continue to explain the performance of our products and geographies and include commentaries appropriate, however we believe the consolidated view of our quarterly financials is more consistent with disclosures from our respective peer group.","With that, let's review our first quarter financial results. Revenue for the first quarter was a record $180.6 million, up 1.3% from the prior quarter and up 17.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. First quarter clear aligner revenue was a $168.2 million, was up 1.2% sequentially and up 18.8% year-over-year. Our year-over-year growth reflected higher Invisalign volumes led by our international doctors as well as higher international ASPs.","For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 112,200 cases were up approximately 1,000 cases largely due to the factors Tom described earlier. Year-over-year growth of 14.3% was driven by volume growth of our international doctors\u2019 case shipments as well as continued expansion of our customer base.","For North American orthodontists Q1 Invisalign case volume increased 3.9% sequentially and 10.5% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentists Q1 Invisalign case volume decreased 1% sequentially and increased 7.4% year-over-year.","For international doctors Invisalign case volume decreased 1% sequentially for seasonal factors however increased 31.2% year-over-year. We continue to focus on training new Invisalign providers worldwide and in Q1, we added 630 new North American doctors and 1,255 new international doctors for a total of 1,885 new Invisalign doctors. While the number of Invisalign doctors trained in Q1 was down sequentially because of fewer training courses offered in Q1 it was up 9% year-over-year. Total Invisalign utilization for Q1 was 4.3 cases per doctor flat with the same period last year and slightly down from 4.4 cases per doctor in Q4.","First quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was $12.4 million, a 2.8% sequential increase over the fourth quarter reflecting continued penetration in market share gains. On a year-over-year basis, our scanner and services segment increased 3.3%, reflecting a 46.5% increase in scanner volume which was offset somewhat by price and the affect of an iTero scanner upgrade program which benefited last year's first quarter results by $1.4 million.","Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall, gross margin was 76%, down sequentially half a point and up 2.5% points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 79.1%, down slightly sequentially and up 1.9 points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher ASPs and lower inventory reserves as we transitioned to our new SmartTrack material in Q1 a year ago.","Q1 gross margin for our scanner segment was 33.6%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.3 points year-over-year.","Q1, operating expenses were $95.4 million. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $11.9 million due primarily to increased employee compensation expense related to our annual employee performance review process which includes salary increases and promotions as well as annual stock [ramps].","Q1 also includes the benefit of approximately $600,000 from discontinuing the accrual for our medical device excise tax, which I'll explain shortly when I discuss our outlook for Q2.","On a year-over-year basis, Q1, operating expenses were up $11.5 million year-over-year, when compared to our non-GAAP operating expenses a year ago, primarily [into dental] growth of the business as well as headcount additions.","Our first quarter operating margin was 23.1% down 6.6 points sequentially and up 4.3 points when compared to non-GAAP operating margins reported last year and direct related to our higher volumes and gross margins as I just described. With regards to our first quarter tax provision our tax rate was 23.5%. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.39 compared to $0.51 reported in Q4 and compared to a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.26 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving onto the balance sheet. The first quarter accounts receivable balance is $126.2 million up approximately 11.4% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 63 days, a six day increase sequentially mainly due to a slower start for the quarter, and was down one day over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $5 million. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $18 million and free cash flow for the first quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $13 million.","Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities including both short and long term investments were $505 million this compared $472 million at the end of 2013 an increase of $33 million. We also announce today our commitment to return $300 million to shareholders over the next three years through a share repurchase program. As part of this plan we intend to purchase approximately $100 million of shares over the next 12 months.","Our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow position affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers, while simultaneously returning cash to our shareholders through a share repurchase program, this program will also help offset dilution from our employee equity plans. Our management team and Board of Directors believe that our business represents an attractive investment opportunity for both current and potential investors and the repurchase programs demonstrates the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.","Before I comment on the outlook for the second quarter, let me come back to the earlier comment I made with regards to medical device excise taxes. Well in advance of the implementation of the medical device tax in January of last year and on an ongoing basis since then we have consulted with advisers and held extensive discussions with the IRS on the subject of the medical device tax and its application at Align.","In March of this year the IRS informed us that it was now their position that our clear aligner business qualifies for a full tax exemption. As a result we stop paying and accruing medical device taxes in our clear aligner business in March. As I indicated previously this benefited the quarter by approximately $600,000. On an ongoing basis it will amount to a savings of approximately $1.8 million per quarter based on our current clear aligner revenue levels. Our second quarter guidance which I will get to momentarily reflects this.","While we didn\u2019t have the benefit of this news in January when we gave directional comments for 2014 we had anticipated some incremental benefit from the medical device tax. Accordingly we continue to believe our operating margin for 2014 should be consistent with 2013 actual results and not view this new information as an update to those aspirations.","Let\u2019s now turn to our business outlook for the second quarter and the factors that inform our view. Q2 is seasonally a busier quarter for our international doctors and we anticipate Invisalign case shipments to increase sequentially from Q1. Our North American doctors report improving patient traffic flow in their office and an increase in new patients consults. Therefore we expect Invisalign case shipments in North America to be up from Q1 as well. For our scanner business, we had a good start for the year and we anticipate building on this momentum in Q2.","With this is a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 116.500 to 119.500 cases. We expect net revenue to be in the range of $181.7 million to $186.5 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.6% to 75.2%. The sequential decrease from Q1 primarily reflects higher training cost revenues and costs which carry lower gross margins.","We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $96.8 to $98.7 million. This sequential increase reflects greater TV media spend as we get in front of the teenage summer rush, continued international investment and our participation in a number of customer events including the upcoming AAO meeting in May and our first ever Asia Pacific Summit in June, offset by lower medical device taxes as previously discussed.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 21.3% to 22.4%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23.0%. And diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $83.6 million excluding any stock repurchases during the quarter. Taking together, we expect EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.39.","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments.","Tom Prescott","Thanks David. We\u2019re pleased to have 2014 started off with these solid results. The Align team continues to execute well against both strategic and financial objectives as we work to extend the growth of our Invisalign franchise and begin to create greater leverage from our scanner business.","Based on continued solid operating results and progress towards our long-term strategic objectives, our Board of Directors has authorized a $300 million share repurchase program, which David described earlier.","We believe returning excess cash to shareholders, beyond what we need to invest in the business is the right thing to do. Over the next month or two, much of the Align management team will be with customers at the AAO meeting in New Orleans later this week to see thousands of orthodontists from North America and across the world. And we're also going to be in Singapore in June for our first ever APAC Summit, which will be a sold out event with over 400 key customers from Asia Pacific.","In addition, we are very much looking forward to spending time with our investors during upcoming conferences including our Analysts meeting on May 29th in New York. I will provide a more comprehensive view of our strategy and why we believe Align\u2019s best days are still ahead.","With that I\u2019ll say thank you for your time today and turn the call back to the operator for some questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Fadah - William Blair","","Hi, good afternoon guys. It\u2019s actually Ravi Fadah in for John.","Tom Prescott","","Hey Ravi.","Ravi Fadah - William Blair","Congrats on the great quarter. And just wanted to start with the question on the second quarter guidance, it looks like that first quarter came in a little bit better than expected weather didn\u2019t seem to be an issue and the slow start that you had talked about last quarter, you seem to be able to push through those pretty well. Yet the second quarter guidance seems like it\u2019s a little bit more conservative relative to our expectations than, at least relative to our expectations. What is driving your thought process that would prevent it from being a significant step up from Q1?","Tom Prescott","Ravi, I'll start maybe from a qualitative perspective and let David come back and comment more quantitatively. In this case, we think is the net activity level, the patient traffic that did have some impact in North America. And while I think most of those appointments probably got reschedule, they took a little time to do that. That showed up a little bit more on the GP side and the ortho side.","And some of that softness will play into Q2 shipments, especially with the earlier part of March that those would normally that volume growth would have seen is differed a bit. As we certainly ended the quarter, we had very strong robust pipeline and doctors are reporting, patients are in and offices are full and all those dynamics are good. But clearly, there is a month or two hit them is through the quarter that was tough.","So, qualitatively that's the biggest part of the shift into the first part of Q2. I'll let David add to it, if he wants to add some color.","David White","Yes. The only thing I guess I would add is, when we put our guidance together we look at seasonality trends over the last three or four years the company has experienced. We look at information that we get from the field in terms of demand we're seeing from individual doctors and so forth. And we use all that to try and form our guidance.","If you look at our historical seasonality and you look at how much we're projecting -- if you look at our guidance today and how much has the percentage increase our growth year-over-year. It is slightly down from where our three, four year average has been, but it\u2019s not significantly. And so those factors that Tom just inferred, planning to cause to be tempered a little bit for the second quarter than what might historically been otherwise.","Ravi Fadah - William Blair","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And what you see the patient traffic trends right now looking like and do you see them improving, did you see them in March and April structure get a little bit better?","Tom Prescott","Well, in certainly March, we\u2019ll stop with March. Definitely a significant rebound and I think the cascade of what weather caused surprise our customers a little bit and they went to an offline reschedule churn. Our customers pretty much across the board are reporting full offices and busy practices and if anything that\u2019s sharpen their appetite to get back to growing their practice I think chunk of the industry had a softer start, which for our customers means lower cash received months and they don\u2019t like that.","So, in general we think things are healthy, but I will come back with comment earlier. With all that happening, we are seeing a pretty big sequential increase Q1 and Q2 and that\u2019s implied in our guidance. So, we are pretty comfortable direction of business is going, but it\u2019s still pretty big step up for Q2.","Ravi Fadah - William Blair","Great, thanks very much, guys.","Tom Prescott","Sure Ravi.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Block - Stifel","Great and good afternoon guys. The first question is actually just on the Express cases. If I look at full versus express I think you are giving us, David as you mentioned a little less granularity than in the past, but Express cases were up roughly 5% year-over-year. In 2013 express was up 35%, so clearly you had a more difficult comp. Can you sort of talk to what might be going on specific to the Express cases? is it just a tough comp thing and now Express 5 is two years removed or are some of these wires and brackets guys we have heard the environment there is \u201cstreet fight.\u201d Are they starting to throw some clear aligners into try to get some of the wire and bracket share? Thanks.","Tom Prescott","","Let me take this in a couple of ways. One, probably the biggest factor that makes the comp issue tougher is we were really driving for initial trial with Express 5 you go back a year even two years and we were trying to go as wide as we could to get initial trial, we aren\u2019t doing those promos anymore. We got trial, it actually has been pretty sticky in the practices. We targeted for Express 5 with a more experienced customer that knew what they could move in five stages.","I think there is noise and I think at the low-end more on the GP side there is a lot of labs providing these we spoke about this in the context of thinking about the realigned product and working out through a new channel with Henry Schein. And so I think there is some noise out there. The competitive environment is I think roughly the same and we don\u2019t see what I would call really incredible technology base products at the low-end or at the high-end other than what you are aware of.","So, the bigger factor is with Express are two; one, that comp issue from prior promotions driven kind of volumes which worked we got a good test and trial and adoption although it came to stay just lower? And then secondly and in some ways better than our original expectations for growth unfold cases as our applicability gets wider both in North America and especially outside North America with the greater complexity cases they are treating. And with 51% growth in volume in Asia year-over-year those are just about all full cases. So I think in some ways it\u2019s a wonderful problem. On a percentage basis, Express is certainly growing lower but high quality problem.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay. That was very helpful, Tom. And maybe just two more quick ones. David, it\u2019s hard to do the implied math on the ASP that you\u2019re laying out for 2Q because you\u2019re giving us a little less on non-case and scanner. But just looking at your case volumes at the low end and your revenues at the low end and thinking like $22 million comes from other and scanner. It seems like you\u2019re walking down the implied ASP from 1,400 to 1,405 this quarter to maybe like 1,360, 1,370, can you talk to that? Because again as Tom just mentioned, a lot of the growth is coming from these four cases. So, why would we see a step down in ASP that dramatically sequentially?","David White","Well, good question. I think a lot of that, John, has to do with our estimations as to the effects of mix in the next quarter. And when we think about mix, Tom is talking about geographically Asia Pac being strong and so forth. So, when we think about Q2, we\u2019re anticipating a bigger rebound on North America, given the softness it started out with. And that\u2019s why we do some of the simpler cases. And actually when you think about it, that\u2019s where we do a large percentage of the Express types of cases. So as North America rebounds, it tends to lower that ASP quarter-over-quarter as a result.","Tom Prescott","And I\u2019ll jump in on top of that. The second part that North America trend, we see the pipeline activity goes directly to Advantage program for top doctors. Because of the softer market environment and dynamics in Q1, number of doctors, even big orthos fell short of what their expectations were, and maybe I think it\u2019s a pricing. We had a lot of GPs that didn\u2019t deliver volume and didn\u2019t get the kind of pricing. It\u2019s not the way we want to higher ASP when our customers don\u2019t do the volume they or we expected but it\u2019s a fact. So as we project greater activity, greater volumes from these committed customers, that\u2019s a direct relationship to ASP. Those two factors together kind of make up the difference.","Jon Block - Stifel","","Okay. And last one if I could just quickly ask. You clearly brought on a lot of sales reps in North America last year and I think it was maybe about this time last year, yet we\u2019re seeing a decel in North American cases. It\u2019s a messy quarter from a weather perspective et cetera, but can you just talk at a high level, are these guys taking longer to get ramped up, are we seeing a little bit of the law of diminishing returns in the last 40 reps you brought on, how are those sales reps performing in the field over the past 9 months? Thanks guys.","Tom Prescott","","Sure, it\u2019s an easy one. We think actually the team is performing very, very well. And we\u2019re certainly one of the first to go out in our space of dentistry but I think the market is going to, at least the direct sell-through, not through distribution where there is a buffering effect for timing, I think the direct sale companies in general are all going to be looking at little bit softer period in North America, offset to some extent by Europe or Asia growing.","Our team is doing great, we still believe we\u2019re very -- we know we\u2019re very underpenetrated. We believe there is still opportunities to feather in more sales coverage and we will do that over time. If it\u2019s significant enough to talk about in numbers, we\u2019ll do as we\u2019ve done before and describe that.","But I think the deceleration you are describing, once we normalized for all the factors in our business including the APAC distributor, I think our core growth rates continue to be about 16%. And that\u2019s even off of a very big base. That\u2019s not across the world equivalently, but our biggest market coverage is still North America. The team is doing very, very well there. So this is not a perfectly linear business and certainly isn\u2019t perfect. But I think we\u2019re on the right track here and we got a lot of confidence in the team.","Jon Block - Stifel","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks and good evening. Tom, I just wanted to kind of follow up, and David I just want to follow up on the guidance for 2Q. It kind of sounds like you are assuming that patient traffic is picking and you are sort of model the case shipment and you model the revenues that way. But David if I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, you are suggesting that gross margins would be down sequentially as well as operating profit margins would be down sequentially. And I guess maybe I understand the gross margins a little bit, if it\u2019s a mix or ASP issue but could you elaborate a little bit more on why the margins step down so much in 2Q?","David White","Well, couple of things. When we think about Q2 and I thought initially, you were going to talk about Q1. But if you look at the quarter, Q1 was 76%, it was gross margin for the total company. And our guidance, the middle of our guidance is somewhere around 75% or so. So, it\u2019s down about a point. Some of that is due to the fact that Q2, we typically see a pickup in revenues and costs associated with training activities and those training activities typically we price and so forth at very, very de minimis margin.","And so the effect of that increase of -- in the non-case revenue associated with training that picking up quarter over quarter, it tends to bring the overall gross margins down. And that\u2019s the principal reason between Q1 and Q2.","On the operating margin side, our operating expenses, we did guide up a little bit quarter over quarter. Some of that is due to the fact that our Q2 is typically a heavy promotional period for us, particularly as we get ready for the summer season for teens and so forth. We have a number of promotions that we typically begin in the second quarter and a number of media campaigns that get kicked off in the second quarter in advance of that summer season. And so you see a little bit of pick up in our expenses associated with that. And as we have also talked about throughout this year, we are investing in what we call the number of global strategic imperatives which Tom talked about in his prepared remarks and so forth.","The largest component of that has to do with market expansion. And some of that\u2019s geographic coverage expansions, some of that is territory coverage increases and so forth, so that also tends to be a little bit of the reason for the pick-up in operating expenses.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. And Tom, maybe if I could just sort of follow up, obviously we got the news from the ITC into quarter here and obviously that was good news for you guys. Could you maybe elaborate, maybe a little bit more on kind of where the company goes from here, where that situation stands? And as you kind of give the situation in ClearCorrect, I mean do you think it\u2019s an opportunity for your sales force to go after and start to try to sign those doctors up and start to take that market share, and how do you think about the competitive landscape at this point, is there anything else beyond ClearCorrect that\u2019s kind of on your periphery that you\u2019re paying attention to?","Tom Prescott","Well, if there is a place where we can be both confident in our strategy and (inaudible) get out, that\u2019s kind of where we live. We assume everybody wants into this market and are working very hard to do so. There is no other competitive dynamics other than what I commented on a moment ago. And our best strategy forward to deal with that is to innovate like crazy, keep bringing better value to our customers and make the product work better and better. Our goal long term is standard of care.","So, I would really not comment specifically, I think the process is still kind of in final stages of working out. I do have Roger George here with us and whatever he wants to comment on from a practical perspective next steps ClearCorrect ITC specific, Roger please maybe do so.","Roger George","","Sure. Well why don\u2019t I do it this way, with Tom\u2019s comments to your question, would you like to refine the question at all that I might respond to?","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","I am not sure how I\u2019d refine. I mean basically, I mean is there any sort of injunctions placed against ClearCorrect I mean will they be out of the market soon, and I am guessing really just trying to understand if you all believe that it\u2019s an opportunity to ultimately take that market share at some point in the foreseeable future.","Roger George","","So, let me start with that point, our sales force has been pretty aware for quite some time that we don\u2019t really share any customers ClearCorrect, we don\u2019t really have any customers who are Invisalign providers who are also doing cases with ClearCorrect. And in a lot of cases or in a lot of the instances, doctors who are doing cases with ClearCorrect are those who are not invited to do cases with us any more for various reasons. The order that was issued by the International Trade Commission is a cease-and-desist order saying that ClearCorrect has to stop importing goods meaning their software digital treatment plans that infringe our patents and that they have got to stop producing aligners with that stuff.","Now you know that they have responded that the cease-and-desist order doesn\u2019t their change their life and that it\u2019s still business for usual as them. I don\u2019t how know how you can read a very long detailed order saying cease-and-desist from the federal government that they have got to stop. But that\u2019s the position they are taking. So, they intend to appeal various parts of that order and we intend to move forward based on what the order says and we will be going back to patent litigation in Texas to take up the damages part of our case.","Tom Prescott","Hey Glen if I could just maybe finish the thought off here. We have said before we didn\u2019t feel that much of the headwind from them and we don\u2019t think there is a much of a tailwind. We obviously love to grow our customer base with doctors that believe in clear aligner treatment and over time we\u2019ll work on doing that. But in terms of a shared customer base or big opportunity, that\u2019s not the way we\u2019re thinking about this one.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks so much.","Tom Prescott","Sure. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the questions. Just looking at the ASPs and specifically the international ASPs, again expanded significantly year-over-year but I imagine that obviously is related to the switch in 2013 to direct distribution. If I look at that international ASP sequentially it seems like a little bit more of a steady state forming there. And Tom I know you mentioned bringing a few other countries or if I should say going direct in a few other countries. How should we think about the ASP on international? Is what we\u2019ve seen in the last two quarters a starting to solidify into a more normalized run rate?","Tom Prescott","Short answer is yes, notwithstanding FX, notwithstanding some other things we might do. I think there is a clearer mix shift in Europe, in Asia towards full cases because of the greater complexity in (inaudible). And then secondly there is a bit of a price premium in each of those markets over North American pricing that is persisted. With that said, once we get passed May 1, the comp will be cleaner, the read-through will be cleaner relative to ASP versus volume, but I mean even with Asia volume up 51% what that\u2019s done for our net ASPs there.","So I think it is stabilizing, but I would say given that growth outside North America has been significantly faster than in, I think to the extent ASP holds to the extent that we're able to get more complex cases with widening applicability things like deep bite and more then I think it does buffer us against some mix shift, the low end here in North America, it does buffer us a little against the negative effects of FX if and when that comes, but the trend in general is just as you described.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Now I guess just on, iTero, if I could sneak some in on the scanner side, [news was] they have been pretty positive, but if I look at unit growth for 46.5% year-over-year versus sales growth, just I guess any inside you can give us on discounts and promotions, trade ups and then is there a different way we should be thinking about unit versus revenue growth going forward?","Tom Prescott","May be David and I can tag team a little bit. I\u2019ll just say in general, the market\u2019s gotten more competitive. We have met that competitive we have a very premium scanner and we are not the lowest priced unit, but just about a year ago, we basically made a decision to simplify pricing and reduce pricing and that\u2019s been rewarded.","So in general volume has grown faster than revenue if you look at a year-over-year basis, but we're confident overtime, we could make this a profitable and increasingly valuable part of franchise. David if you want to add color there please.","David White","Yes. Once again when you kind of drill down a little bit, certainly volumes are up I think in my prepared comments of something north of 40% year-over-year in volumes, there are two things from a revenue standpoint, when you look at it year-over-year, one of which is the fact that a year ago we had a special promotion going on for iTero, for upgrades, as we released the new version. And when you normalize for that, you see well that was a -- that had the effect of increasing revenues last year.","Tom Prescott","In the volume of scanners.","David White","And the volume of scanners is I said up about 46% or so. So, ASPs are at this point a pretty stable. We took some pricing actions when we announced the new iTero scanner about a year ago, pricing has been pretty stable over the past year. And I think going forward, I think we'll see a pretty normalized rate of business as it continues to grow and we continue to see adoption of the product.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That makes a lot of sense. And then just the other one on the scanner, obviously looking at impressive chart hereof digitally submitted Invisalign cases and I think you probably get this question every quarter Tom. But any progress other than the current scanners out there in the market that can submit Invisalign cases digitally, any progress on some of the other larger installed bases and any ability to work with them?","Tom Prescott","Well, I was as clear [in a word] as I could be in my comment and they stand for themselves. But the reality is it's not to reveal and every scanner is different. And in effect we're releasing a new factory floor technology as a front end of a process. And any other party would have to be very certain there to work well. And that's what we're after. So when there is news there, we'll be happy to report it. And we expect it would make our customers even happier and overtime build greater strategic advance for the Invisalign franchise.","So, it is a priority, I think it's in our interest to do so and I'll stop there.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks for the questions.","Tom Prescott","Sure. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Bob. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions.","Tom Prescott","Hi Steve.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hey everybody. One is for David and one for Tom. David, I wonder if you could even qualitatively walk us through the margin profile over the balance of the year. There has been a lot of focus on the first quarter and the guide for the second quarter, but you\u2019ve given us a perspective on 2014 in totality. Can you remind us what the key levers we should be thinking about over the balance of the year; any perspective if you have it on how operating expense growth might trend will be very helpful?","And then Tom for you, I wonder if you could without stealing all the thunder comment on the Analyst Day that\u2019s coming up. It\u2019s not something you do every year, this is the first, I want to say in about four years. So, why now and what should be we focusing on? Thanks everyone?","Tom Prescott","I\u2019ll let David go first (inaudible) happy to comment.","David White","Okay. So Steve, on our gross margin profile, I am going to focus my comments primarily on Invisalign side of our business since that pretty much dominates our overall margin profile as a company. When you look at Invisalign and you look at our margin profile and so forth, it\u2019s perhaps most heavily influenced by really a couple of factors. One is, is product mix, which drives ASP. And when I talk about product mix, I probably should drill down a little bit more, really more from the standpoint of geographic mix.","And so as we seen our international business continue to grow at faster rates in North America that is have the effective lifting ASPs overall for the company and as we lift those ASPs that has the effect of lifting our gross margins overall at the same time.","On the cost side, our cost model is largely today benefits from high utilization in the factory, high volumes. And as we continue to grow the business, we continue to benefit from better absorption of fixed overhead in the factories which drive down cost on a per case basis.","So, as we think about going out over the next year or so with those trends continue, our business continues to grow as we would expect and as our international business continues to increase as a percentage of the total mix with the company than our expectation would be that our margin should see some uplift, our gross margin see some uplift to them.","Now I temper that a little bit from the standpoint that when you look at our business model that we\u2019ve guided overall from a long-term standpoint, we\u2019ve set our overall gross margin business model somewhere in the 73% to 78% range and we are consistently operating well within that if not at the high side of that. So, I wouldn\u2019t want you to get too far over we\u2019ve already guided from that perspective, but those are the drivers that have perhaps the most influence on gross margin.","From an OpEx standpoint, in January we talked a lot about some of the investments that we are making as a company and how those investments were a part of a consorted effort on our part to balance our growth profile for the year and for the long-term relative to and the investments it would take to drive that relative to what our operating margins as a company might be. And the direction we have given really for this year is our aspirations would be to achieve the same type of operating margin performance in 2014 as what we did in 2013.","Tom Prescott","","If I can pile on just to finish that one off a little bit with a hammer, this year is a little bit like last year in some ways where our investment framework is more front-end loaded for the year, headcount expansions, key initiatives, some step up in consumer spend versus a year ago we were still developing new adds, we launched in May, we\u2019re out in market within Q1, Q2 with a little more consumer, fully loaded headcount in place versus maybe partial year last year. So, and in parallel with that in Q1 we had a little bit of volume challenge. We had some headwinds in terms of certainly North America market.","All those things add up and a little less momentum going into Q2 for volume all those things add up to say little more pressure on operating margin what David described is getting back towards an operating margin profile roughly compared to last year, which means a pretty big lift in the second half, but we believe the pieces are in place to go do that. And as much as we\u2019ve showed last year, we believe when those come together we can demonstrate that progress. And then quarter-to-quarter hope to over perform the kind of numbers David was pointing to. So, hopefully that takes care of the model and you want to shift briefly to the Analyst Day?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Absolutely.","Tom Prescott","Perfect. All right, so yes it has been a while, I think 3, 3.5 years. And there is a reason for that; we\u2019ve kind of had our heads down for a couple of years executing like crazy. We believe we\u2019ve really changed the state of the enterprise in many, many ways. One of those is visible in product and market impact in growth in the financial progress we\u2019re making. And there is other ways that most of our owners having a chance to meet the number of the senior management team.","We\u2019ve got incredibly talented group of folks here and I think this provides and affords our owners an opportunity to get them know them to hear from them about our markets, our geographies, our technology evolving and how we\u2019re going to scale the business.","And so, I\u2019d say I believe Thursday the 29th of May we\u2019re looking forward to spend the better part of the half a day together. And hopefully you\u2019ll take away what we believe which is great excitement about where we are today, but even more about what the future looks like and that\u2019s we\u2019ll focus lot on strategy evolution there.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Thanks so much everyone.","Tom Prescott","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Tom Prescott","","Hey Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","","Tom or David, I think if you could quantify the mix of Asian Invisalign cases as a percent of total or is the percent of the international business? And then could you give us an update around uptake in China and that\u2019s performing relative to your internal plan?","Tom Prescott","So without giving numbers because we haven\u2019t broken out that detailed level, the very substantial majority of all of our volume outside North America is full of cases. There are fewer teen cases treated as many of the countries in Europe where we have a little more maturity have state plants basically free for brackets and wires. We are getting teen cases, that\u2019s going nicely but it\u2019s on a pretty small base. The bulk of what gets treated are full and mostly adult cases today.","And so I\u2019ll leave that there. China is going game busters as is Japan, as our some other geographies. And the team has big ideas about how we can make that a very big business. And you\u2019ll start to see that showing up just year-over-year in volume, which then you can tell there is leverage on the revenue side. So, we're right on track with our very aggressive game plans and the team is working like the [dickens] to continue that.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Thanks. And one more Tom, with respect to the new ClinCheck software, the enhanced functionality seems pretty significant in terms of what the practitioners are able to do themselves. Do you perceive that as a case volume driver? And if you could elaborate on what some of the early feedback has been that would be helpful?","Tom Prescott","","Well, and again our highest volume customers who treat the most cases and a lot of most complex cases, sometimes do the most ClinCheck cycle just to get it perfect before they press go. And this really reduces those cycles when they are getting close, but instead of sending it back to their, even a treat technician that knows their human approach very well and describing a little lateral movement or a little rotation of two or three teeth. They can actually move that and it's a virtual model that actually moves and shows collisions and then they can send it in and teeth that goes Ah, I got it.","It might as some of our doctors tell us, it might cut through one, two or three treatment cycles and communication while they are close. And so we think yes, the output is greater adoption and getting a bigger share of their practice. But it starts with having the customer get what they want more quickly and having that customer experience to be better. More precision, it gives them more confidence in the treatment and it reduces absolute factor of it.","So, all those things are in the side of good and we're getting a lot of positive feedback from our doctors, most of them are more experienced, many of them are orthodontists about, boy this is just what I wanted, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time. Thank you.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Perfect. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Brandon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Thanks guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me just through a couple of more out there. One Tom on the international ASP and kind of following up on Jon's question and I think another one we had as well. I think last quarter you talked about kind of the shift going away from i7, away from Express 5 and then up to Express 10 and i14 and that being one of the drivers along with just playing the international mix of kind of slow steady rise in ASPs going forward.","Yet to Jon's point on one of your earlier questions, it looks like your implied guidance is for ASP is to be down sequentially, at least in the second quarter. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those two. Should I think about kind of that slow steady ASP rise being more of a long-term guidance, but there is going to be some volatility from quarter-to-quarter just based on mix or how should I think about that?","David White","Yes. This is David. I think you just hit it right there. I mean from quarter-to-quarter, there is seasonality in our business, different seasonality in Asia versus Europe versus North America and that tends to influence geographic mix, which will affect ASPs. I think when we talk about our ASP trend overtime and a mixed shift towards international business where there is a much heavier concentration on complex cases and that is driving ASPs, that\u2019s more of a long-term type of trend as we see it today. And so you shouldn\u2019t take our guidance as necessarily being anything that would be indicative of a change in that trend and our expectations.","Tom Prescott","Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","No, please Tom, go ahead.","Tom Prescott","I was just going to say reiterating, our expectations are that our North American doctors will be busier, many of that, much of that volume comes through our advantaged customers and we want them to deliver that volume and get that discount that will directly relate to ASP in North America, which tends to skew that down a little bit.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Yes. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then David just two quick follow-ups; one, in the absence of share repurchases this year, what would you expect, the share count has been fairly stable here over the last couple of years, but stock price is up quite a bit. Would you expect absent share repurchases share count to trend up this year?","And then a second one just technically can you tell me why you are not subject to the MedTech tax any longer, I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is any derivative recruiting in my other companies?","David White","So, the way I would look at it as it relates to share count is I think that the guidance we gave for Q2 is 83.6 million shares. One of the things that obviously increases that is going to be stock options as they vest, which we pretty much don\u2019t grab into longer, but we still have a tail of those that are still cycling through the final vesting on those. And then we have employee RSUs. So, if I was modeling and I would just simply look at what our historical uptick has been quarter-over-quarter and assume that and apply that to basically the guidance we gave is that related to Q2 for shares outstanding.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Okay.","David White","As it relates to the medical device tax, it\u2019s a little bit more complex but let me see if I can make it really simple. Our business is a little bit unique relative to many other companies in our space. We sell directly to doctors, we don\u2019t sell through wholesale channels and so forth. And so, a year or plus ago when we were evaluating the applicability of the medical device tax to the company and so forth with the advice of outside consultants and so forth and given that this is a very new law that was still subject to some interpretation, our assessment at that time was that our company would most likely be fall under the ruling and we would have to pay medical device taxes.","Now, we -- during that course of that year that evaluation was on a number of subjective criteria that is outlined in the law. So over the course of the last year, we have had a number of dialogs with the IRS. And in the course of that and in the course re-reviewing our case and how those subjective guidelines apply to us, the IRS informed us in March that they believe that we should be exempt from the medical device tax and based on that subjective criteria and how they apply to our business. And so that effectively we have stopped accruing for the taxes effective in March.","Tom Prescott","","And I just want to say here, we don\u2019t think this is a cookie cutter. I would urge you not to make assumptions that another business or model might apply. I\u2019ll say our team has done good work, it\u2019s not quite finished yet in terms of an overall process. But as we finish this off and have more to disclose under this, there will be a little more information. But again, this is -- you\u2019re hearing it at real time, there are [timing] implications and accrual implications which is why we\u2019re dealing with it as a Q1 issue and a Q2 guidance matter.","David White","Yes. And just to pile on to Tom\u2019s comment, it is a case-by-case assessment and so our case facts are going to be different from almost any other company you would look at. And so, I don\u2019t think you can rinse and repeat necessarily what we\u2019ve applied here.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then just two quick follow-ups I guess on that there is no catch up provision or anything where you can go back and capture device tax you paid over the last 4.5 quarters, anything like that?","David White","So a good question. I think the answer to that is yes. We\u2019ve historically paid about $8.3 million between 2013 and the first two months of this calendar year. We\u2019ve applied for refund for that. The refund however though is processed through a separate division of the IRS, obviously they talk to one another but that separate division has to go through audit and approve it. That audit has not been completed. When it does, we would expect the answer to come back that we would get a full refund.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","And lastly, yes.","Tom Prescott","Just to be really clear, we can\u2019t project that, it is in process and there is nothing more than what you just heard, can we do anything with so.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","No, understood. And just so I am doing the math right that\u2019s about 100 basis points per quarter going forward here of margin benefit I guess relative to how we had set our model up?","David White","It\u2019s about $1.5 million to $2 million of expense a quarter.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","It comes out of cost\u2026","Tom Prescott","At our current revenue run rates.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Yes, right. Understood. Thanks guys.","Tom Prescott","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis at the Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Tom Prescott","","Hey Chris.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners","I just wanted to go back on the volume guidance for the second quarter at 11% year-over-year. That\u2019s still healthy double-digit growth but a slight pull back versus I guess the 14% this quarter and kind of that high teen to low 20% range in the second half of last year. So understand weather played a factor there with delaying some cases and possibly pushing out some of those shipments and time the revenue is recognized, but I guess Tom beyond the weather, are there any other factors or some of the market challenges that you would mention that\u2019s contributing to that volume outlook in the second quarter?","Tom Prescott","Chris, I think it\u2019s, the look at the business it\u2019s actually pretty clean. I think if I take a rough -- if I norm for a lot of factors that have impacted revenue and volume, our growth as a company is somewhere in the neighborhood of 16% through all the different factors that have been puts and takes over last year two volume, revenue, et cetera.","Q2 guidance is impacted by an improving March receipts, which means improving April shipments, but we weren\u2019t at the rate we wanted to be. If we had be running for all of March out of receipts level, we would be a little bit more bullish in our guidance and so figure that 30-day lapse.","The business has responded -- we\u2019re really comfortable with our pipeline but all that is factored into our Q2. So yes, we\u2019re -- it\u2019s a little underwhelming, but it\u2019s going the right direction. And we believe we\u2019re still getting get to a place for the year where we\u2019re going to have another really terrific year and putting us in broader context, the orthodontic market is probably growing in mid single-digits maybe in a good year 6%, in a bad year 3% to 5%. We\u2019re growing in almost every market 2 to 3 to 4x that rate. And so, our view is as long as we\u2019re doing that, whatever the absolute number quarter to quarter is, we\u2019re less worried about it.","The contrary would be true if we thought there are some new fundamental competitive dynamic or something going on in the market, we don\u2019t see any of those factors. The business is actually doing great. We\u2019re going to AAO this week to see thousands of our orthodontics customers. And I think we\u2019re very bullish about the business, both I\u2019d say near and mid-term as well as the long-term.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners","Great, thanks for the color there. On the deep bite G5, I know it\u2019s still relatively early, but it sounds like you saw lot of excitement with the G5 launch events you talked about. Maybe you can just provide some more feedback you have seen from those customers and the reception so far in the field?","Tom Prescott","Sure. I think, the first thing is we\u2019ve seen the use of the deep bit features go up significantly, it\u2019s very early where we have doctors that were already treating some deep bite, they are jumping right on it. Because bite ramps and some other features make it easier for them to actually do those treatments.","Where we have doctors that hadn\u2019t done deep bite before, it\u2019s a more, let me try 2 or 3 cases and see how it evolves. And we\u2019re 7 weeks since release, and you would have had to have deep bite case kind of in process.","So, we\u2019re very early in terms of those doctors that were not doing deep bite with clear aligners. But we\u2019re getting very good feedback from them. And we\u2019re approaching a point at quarter end 3, 6, 9 months in, we\u2019re really going to see the acceleration of those cases.","And then we believe that\u2019s what really impacts utilization growth in that area. a lot of the doctors in Europe that were treating deep bite are really excited about this. And we\u2019re seeing same thing happen there, a little bit of a lag in Asia, as they really are more -- they are treating extraction cases more in general. But again seven weeks in since release, since launch, we have a whole bunch of internal metric use, they are all green, and we got a lot to learn in the months and quarters ahead, but some of these hard deep bite cases are a year and a half to sometimes two years long.","And so we are going to be learning as we go through the next 6 to 12 months about how the product is evolving and we will make improvements as we go long, but all good so far.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners","If I could just kick take one more in. On R&D line, it looks like expense jumped out quite a bit there over the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year, so maybe just walk us through the reasons behind that increase?","Tom Prescott","We have some headcount expansions, we have programs spending in a couple of important areas. What I would say in general when we come back at analyst day and start talking about IP, we are inventing more things, we are writing more disclosures, we are filing for more patents, all those factors were being, were very active in terms of technology with large R&D specifically and clinical research and some other areas that are going on.","So I think you\u2019ll have a chance to meet our Head of R&D at the analyst day Zelko Relic and as well as our marketing leader and talk about how we see the pipeline evolving, what is possible in the future state, and this is the money we are investing to do those things.","David White","Yes. Chris, I would just add to that reinforce I guess the comments I made earlier a bit. As you look at broadly speaking, our expenses went up from Q4 to Q1 for a number of things. Q4 was artificially lower because of some core features we had of stock, which gave us a credit for stock compensation expense. And then Q1 as we start on security taxes and we have our annual [focal] process for employee compensation et cetera. And so generally speaking those are the largest drivers quarter-over-quarter and coupled with the comment Tom just made as it relates to some of our strategic growth drivers that we are also investing in.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners","Okay, congrats on the quarter.","Tom Prescott","","Thanks very much Chris.","Shirley Stacy","","Well thank you everyone.

We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our second quarter 2019 conference call slides on our website, under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the second quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and scanners.","John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open-up the call to questions.","Our second quarter revenues were at the high-end of our guidance reflecting Invisalign volume growth primarily from international doctors as well as very strong sales from iTero Scanner and Services.","Q2 Invisalign volumes were 24.6% year-over-year compared to 30.5% year-over-year in second quarter 2018 reflecting continued adoption from teenage and younger patients as well as increased utilization and expansion of our customer base with total over 60,000 active doctors worldwide.","From a product perspective, we had good growth across the Invisalign portfolio with non-comprehensive products outpacing comprehensive led by Invisalign Go globally. Total Invisalign case shipments for Q2 were lower than expected, primarily due to softness in China related to a tougher consumer environment and slower growth in young adult cases in North America.","Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results starting with the Americas Regions. The Americas region Q2 Invisalign case volumes was up 4.2% sequentially, 16.5% year-over-year compared to 22% year-over-year in Q2 2018 reflecting growth both in the Orthodontist and GP channels as well as continued strength from teenage patients in Invisalign Go.","In Q2 we trained approximately 3,000 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region of which more than half were the North American doctors. On a sequential basis, Q2 Invisalign volume growth reflects increased utilization for the Americas region overall driven by North American Orthos at 18.9 cases per doctor, with continued adoption of Invisalign with Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First used to treat patients as young as six years old.","We also had solid performance from GP Dentists with continued momentum from Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Go. Invisalign Go is uniquely designed for GPs and features a digital chairside experience using the iTero Intraoral Scanner and streamlined tooth movement capabilities. It's a really great product and we're very pleased with its performance including with our DSO partners who are using it to help their providers introduce Invisalign treatment into practice.","Invisalign Go integrates well with the DSO model, which remains a very important part of our overall business as we continue to see DSO growth rates outpacing the non-DSO doctors significantly.","Year-over-year Q2, Invisalign volume growth in the Americans region was driven \u2013 continued to strengthen the Ortho channel with 19.7% growth, compared to 25% year-over-year as well as increase of 11.6% from the GP channel. In Q2 we saw adult case growth from North American orthodontists reflecting a more crowded competitive environment, especially for young adults in the 20 to 29 year old demographic who really value convenience and costs.","We know there's about a 10% overlap with our adult demographic with SDC. If you have an increased awareness for the direct-to-consumer clear aligners and heavy advertising spend from DTC players case starts may be shifting away from traditional practices.","We also believe that doctors are sampling alternative products and are taking advantage of wires and bracket bundles that essentially gave clear aligners away for free or at very low prices. These competitive dynamics are not surprising and were validated during our recent customer visits.","Nonetheless, they appear to be working themselves out in the first few weeks of Q3. We've seen improving trends in North America. In July, our executive team and I spent a week meeting with over 200 orthodontists in four major U.S. cities Fort Lauderdale, Dallas, Denver, and LA, and did not hear anything that gave me pause about a competitive performance standpoint.","That's not to say that we didn't get feedback about how to make things better, especially around to help doctors to compete more effectively against DTC offerings. But doctors consistently told us that the Invisalign system is the best product, there is hands down technically and clinically.","Given the changing DTC landscape, we're focused on further differentiation and Invisalign treatment for both consumers and doctors. In Q3, we're increasing investment in consumer demand with a new advertising campaign for North America and expanding marketing programs such as our concierge service, which connects potential patients with Invisalign doctors increasing conversion and stickiness.","In addition, we're launching new sales tools and professional marketing materials. We'll also expect to see increased productivity from the 100 plus sales representatives we added in Q1.","We'll also look for opportunities to leverage the Invisalign product portfolio, the doctors to treat patients as needed and compete with DTC offerings. Expanding on products like Invisalign Go and Lite will help close the gaps many doctors see with DTC patients who are looking for price and convenience.","Finally, in Latin America, we continue to make great progress led by Brazil in developing the emerging clear aligner segment in the world's leading market for beauty and cosmetic procedures.","In Q2, Invisalign volume in Latin America was up significantly year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments as we continue to build our business in the region. Training approximately 1,300 Invisalign doctors during the quarter.","For our international business, Q2 was a good quarter with strong Invisalign volume growth of 36.7% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region.","On a sequential basis, international volume was up nicely reflecting growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In Q2, we trained approximately 3,500 new Invisalign doctors internationally, over half of which were in the Asia Pacific region.","In EMEA, Q2 was another strong quarter with volumes up 39.0% year-over-year driven by growth across the region with record Invisalign volumes in all but one country market led by Iberia. We saw strength across the Invisalign product portfolio with continued momentum from Invisalign Go.","We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by Central and Eastern Europe. APAC Q2 Invisalign volume increased 33.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from nearly all country markets led by China, Japan and ANZA. We also had strong growth from GP dentists, which were up 52.4% year-over-year.","On a sequential basis, Q2 Invisalign volume for APAC was up nicely led by Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We also had a uptick in adult patients in Q2, following a very strong quarter for teen cases in Q1 in conjunction with a teenage promotion to help drive trial and adoption in the very important teen segment.","During Q2, we trained over 1,900 new doctors in APAC, over 40% were in China. Notwithstanding current consumer sentiment, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China and will continue to invest in our manufacturing operations and training centers to ensure that we operate like a local company and have the capabilities to expand and scale our business as the environment improves.","We are also focusing on what we can influence directly to help mitigate consumer sentiment in China. We are expanding our reach and scope in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities across China, including investment in a GP dentist sales force and sales programs centered on Invisalign Go.","In the last year since the launch of Invisalign Go in APAC, we have learned that doctors benefit from a differentiated approach in training and support and will align our resources accordingly.","We\u2019re also increasing consumer marketing spend in APAC including new advertising like our Doctor Centered ad that is launching in North America next week. Finally, in the second half of this year, we expect to have dozens of Invisalign pop-up centers in China to ensure we educate consumers and connect more with Invisalign doctors.","Outside of China, we have strong growth across APAC including Japan, ANZA, Hong Kong, Taiwan. We will continue to drive adoption and utilization by investing through sales & marketing programs, and clinical education with new training centers like the one we just announced in Taiwan.","Through this center, we have also launched the first integrated postgraduate Invisalign training program in Asia with National Taiwan University Hospital. ","Clinical education and peer-to-peer learning is one of the most impactful ways we help drive adoption of Invisalign treatment. During Q2, we engaged directly with thousands of Invisalign trained doctors around the world providing them with the ability to learn from clinical experts and practice development leaders, and share their experience and insights with each other.","In April we held the 2019 Invisalign China Forum, in Xi\u2019an, attracting over 1,300 industry practitioners and gathering together over 40 experienced orthodontists from all over the country.","During the two-day forum, participants held in-depth discussions on frontier topics such as adolescent orthodontics, extraction in orthodontic treatment and digital dentistry. In May, 300 high volume orthodontists from 37 countries across the Americas, EMEA and APAC participated in the inaugural edition of the Invisalign Symposium on the Digital Practice in London.","The two-day doctor event featured specially designed sessions, combining plenary interaction and small group of working sessions, covering such topics such as: understanding consumers, practice optimization, challenges of building a digital practice, among others.","I was able to address specifically on the digital practice and driving the evolution of digital orthodontics with supporting talks on digital transformation and healthcare and the power of digital treatment planning along with practice optimization with ADAPT.","ADAPT is Align\u2019s consultative program to provide practices with personalized support to help doctors and staff navigate the journey from a braces model to an aligner model in a timely, efficient, and profitable manner. Emphasis is on digital workflow, finances, and consumer acquisition and early results from test sites in the Americas, EMEA and APAC show significant improvements in conversion, revenue growth, practice profits, and other key metrics as practices shift to a digital model and increase their Invisalign share of chair.","In June, we hosted the first Invisalign Scientific Symposium in EMEA, located in Valencia, Spain. The Scientific Symposium focused on evidence based success cases for Invisalign treatment in growing patients with dedicated focus on treatments with Invisalign First and Mandibular Advancement Feature, bringing together nearly 200 of EMEA\u2019s most experienced Invisalign doctors.","In July more than 175 general dentists from all across Europe attended the second annual Invisalign GP Growth Summit in Berlin focused on peer-to-peer learning and emerging industry trends. ","We also just hosted our first Invisalign Teen Summit with about 300 doctors and staff in Los Angeles. The Summit program was focused completely on teen treatment and teen culture, and included a tie-in to VidCon, the top teen culture and community event where Align has a multi-year relationship and strong brand presence.","Teen Summit is designed to turn low-teen submitters into high-teen submitters by combining Invisalign specific clinical and practice \u201chow tos\u201d with an immersive teen culture experience, social media support and training, and insights from teen influencers","Speaking of teens, in Q2 over 100,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 32.2% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions.","For Q2, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North Americas Orthodontists increased 25.0% and International doctors were up 44.4%. Invisalign First and Invisalign treatment with Mandibular Advancement continue to ramp globally and are helping to increase our share of teenagers and younger patients worldwide.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased to see that use of Invisalign treatment among teenagers continues to outpace adults and that Invisalign First is driving really strong growth in the kid\/tween segment.","In fact we reached our 7 millionth Invisalign patient during the quarter, a child in the U.S. being treated with Invisalign First. Since the launch of Invisalign First a year ago, kids under 10 years old have become our fastest growing demographic, up 140% year over year, which also bodes well for continued adoption of teens too.","Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. We invest over $120 million each year in consumer marketing programs including TV, digital and social media, PR, event marketing and our Patient Concierge service.","Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. In Q2, we continued to see strong digital engagement with consumers \u2013 reaching nearly 4.3 million unique visitors on Invisalign.com sites worldwide for a total of 57.5 million visitors to date.","Our other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q2 quarterly slides. During the quarter we developed a new consumer advertising campaign for our three largest markets, the U.S., Canada and China.","This new multi-channel campaign, which launches across North America this Monday, educates consumers on the significant benefits of Invisalign treatment, highlighting our patented SmartTrack technology based on years of research which moves teeth more predictably and comfortably combined with the personalized care of a doctor.","We are more than doubling our media investment behind this new multichannel campaign to extend our reach across adults and parents of teens, increasing our reach\/frequency from 50% to over 70%, in order to capture even more of our target audiences.","In the U.S. our new campaign will run across all media channels including broadcast and TV networks, connected TV such as Hulu and other streaming services, digital media and all social media channels. In Canada, our new ad will go live on digital channels first and then we will layer in TV in the coming weeks. And China will follow suit in the second half.","Q2 was another outstanding quarter for our iTero scanner and services business, with revenues up 82.4% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength across all regions and customer channels, including large account DSOs.","On a sequential basis, revenues were up 30.4% sequentially, reflecting higher scanner sales following a seasonally weaker Q1, especially in North America and Asia Pacific. Increased services revenues reflect higher subscriptions from installed base growth and multi-year deals.","During the quarter we saw continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D imaging system in EMEA, APAC and Canada, since its commercial launch at IDS in the first quarter of this year.","Cumulatively, over 13.7 million orthodontic scans and 3.6 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.","For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 77.3% from 69.6% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 60.8% up from 47.8% in the same quarter last year.","Within the Americas, 92.3% of cases submitted by North American Orthos were submitted digitally.","We continue to expand the iTero portfolio to address doctor\u2019s needs and enable them to more easily adopt Invisalign treatment in their practices. In June, we announced the iTero Element Foundation, extending the portfolio to offer dentists digital workflow capabilities to address their restorative and patient monitoring intraoral scanning needs. ","The streamlined workflows to dental laboratories includes an option for on-demand chairside milling and exclusive TimeLapse technology for patient communication and monitoring with the iTero Element Foundation, which provides dentists with capabilities beyond basic STL export scanners. Software upgrade pathways are also available for Invisalign clear aligners.","The iTero scanner and services business has become an integral part of our business and is key to our end-to-end digital workflow. We believe that every exam should begin with an iTero digital scan because it's a better experience, it improves treatment outcomes and it provides doctor with a chairside tool that enables patients to visualize their future smiles at chairside in less than a minute without any goop \u2013 which increases treatment acceptance and drives practice growth.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to mention the decision to terminate discussions regarding the possible development and distribution agreement that was disclosed as part of the patent settlement agreement with Straumann. As part of this settlement, Align and Straumann signed a non-binding letter of intent to assess the possibility of a five-year global development and distribution agreement whereby Straumann would distribute 5,000 iTero Element scanners.","Additionally, we considered exploring the possibility of offering existing iTero users access to Straumann\u2019s prosthetic and surgical planning workflows. In June, after months of deliberations, we announced the decision to terminate these discussions, and as a result, we received an additional $16 million from Straumann for a total of $51 million settlement.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Morici","Thanks Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results, total revenue for the second quarter was $600.7 million, up 9.4% from the prior quarter and up 22.5% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes approximately $19 million or 4 points of unfavorable foreign exchange.","For Clear aligners, Q2 revenue of $496.7 million was flat sequentially due to Invisalign volume growth in most geographies, partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs and lower SDC volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 14.6% reflects strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs.","On June 1, we had a minor issue with a standard software release that impacted some ClinCheck modifications. It was addressed and communicated to customers quickly. However, it required some Invisalign doctors to re-review their treatment plans. This disrupted the workflow for many doctors, which was compounded by an increase in call volumes into our Treat Operations and Customer Care center that degraded service levels and customer experience. While it\u2019s impossible to quantify, on the margin it probably didn\u2019t help the quarter.","Q2 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially by approximately $15, to $1,230 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign ASPs were down $85 primarily reflecting promotional discounts, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher deferrals related to additional aligners and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases.","Total Q2 Invisalign shipments of 377.1 thousand cases were up 8% sequentially and up 24.6% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 3.7% sequentially and up 19.7% year-over-year. For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 4.9% sequentially and up 11.6% year-over-year. For International doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 13.4% sequentially and up 36.7% year-over-year.","Our Scanner and Services revenue for the second quarter was $104 million, up 30.4% sequentially reflecting growth across all regions and channels including DSOs, partially offset by lower ASP. Year-over-year revenue was up 82.4%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions and related service revenues, partially offset by lower ASP.","Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 72%, down 1.2 points sequentially and down 2.6 points year-over-year. Gross margin was impacted by approximately 1 point year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange.","Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 73.7%, down 1.2 points sequentially primarily due to costs from seasonally higher doctor training and freight. Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case and lower ASPs, as just described.","Scanner gross margin for the second quarter was 63.6%, flat sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year primarily due to increased manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by lower ASP driven by mix.","Q2 operating expenses were $255.8 million, down sequentially 18.6% and up 5.3% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating expenses reflects a benefit of $51 million related to the Straumann litigation settlement, partially offset by our continued investment in sales and R&D activities.","Additionally, Q1 operating expenses included $29.8 million related to Invisalign store closure costs. On a year-over-year basis, operating expense increased due to sales and R&D activities and was partially offset by the Straumann settlement.","Second quarter operating expense included a $51 million benefit from the Straumann litigation settlement, which increased Q2 operating margin by approximately 8 points and diluted earnings per share by $0.57, respectively.","This settlement was higher than anticipated in our Q2 guidance because it included an additional $16 million benefit from the termination of development and distribution agreement, along with $5 million that we would have incurred for development.","Our second quarter operating income was $176.5 million, up 101.2% sequentially and up 43.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating margin was 29.4%, up 13.4 points sequentially and up 4.4 points year-over-year.","The sequential increases in both operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to the $51 million benefit related to the Straumann settlement recorded in the second quarter and the Invisalign store closure costs recorded in Q1 2019.","On a year-over-year basis, the increases in operating income and operating margin primarily reflect the benefit from the Straumann settlement partially offset by lower gross margin and continued investments in sales and R&D. Interest, other income and expense of $17.4 million includes the $15.8 million gain that is related to our sale of our equity investment in SmileDirectClub during the second quarter.","With regards to second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 22.2% which includes approximately $10 million of tax expense related to gains from the Straumann settlement and the sale of the SDC equity investment. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.83, up $0.94 sequentially and up $0.53 compared to the prior year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments were $765.9 million, an increase of $33.4 million from the prior quarter which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by $49.5 million used to repurchase approximately 161,000 shares of our stock. Of our $765.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $582.4 million was held in the U.S. and $183.5 million was held by our International entities.","Q2 accounts receivable balance was $520.1 million, up approximately 8.5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSO was 77 days, down one day sequentially and up nine days from Q2 last year.","Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $177.4 million, up $37.6 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $45.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $132 million.","During Q2 2019, we purchased on the open market approximately 161,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $307.48 per share, including commission for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million. We have $400.5 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program.","With that, let\u2019s turn to our Q3 outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. As we exited Q2 and now into the first weeks of Q3, we are seeing improving volume trends. For International, we expect Q3 volumes to be down sequentially reflecting a seasonally slower period for EMEA, partially offset by a seasonally stronger period for the APAC regions. ","However, given the uncertainty in China, we are reflecting a more cautious outlook for APAC growth. For the Americas, we expect Q3 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting growth across all key country markets, as well as a seasonally stronger period for North America. Orthodontists with the peak of the summer teen season, along with increased media spend and the launch of our new customer advertising campaign as Joe described earlier.","As we typically see, we expect overall Invisalign volume to be flat to slightly up from Q2. We expect our iTero business to be down sequentially coming off another very strong quarter and record growth in Q2. Year-over-year, the iTero business continues to grow across all regions.","And, regarding Smile Direct Club, we expect no clear aligner volume from SDC in Q3. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 370,000 to 380,000 cases, up approximately 16% to 19% year-over-year, on a tough comp from Q3 last year which had record shipments that benefitted from the teen and adult promotions by approximately 2% higher growth rate.","We expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $585 million to $600 million, up approximately 16% to 19% year-over-year. Our Q3 revenue outlook assumes no Smile Direct Club volume compared to the same quarter a year ago where aligners supplied to SDC contributed about $8 million to revenue.","In addition as just mentioned, in Q3 2018 we had higher Invisalign volumes due to the promos, but lower ASPs. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 71.9% to 72.5%. Q3 gross margin is up slightly compared to Q2 as we expect improvement due to price increases and manufacturing productivity.","We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $305 million to $312 million. Our Q3 operating expenses are expected to be significantly higher sequentially as a result of the benefit of $51 million Straumann settlement in Q2 which reduced operating expenses.","We are very pleased with the settlement and are putting the funds to work by stepping up our investment in consumer advertising with a brand new campaign and stepping up our reach and coverage. The new ads focus on the significant technical and clinical advantages of our Invisalign system and differentiates our doctor centered model for consumers. It will launch next week in North America and soon after in China. These ads will carry on throughout the second half of 2019.","Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 19.8% to 20.5%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately 80.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.16.","In addition, we expect to repurchase at least $100 million of our stock in the open market in Q3. As we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q3 to be approximately $50 million to $55 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $24 million to $26 million.","Given our Q3 outlook, I want to make a few comments on our full year. Based on the current growth rates in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2019 total revenue growth rate to be at the low end of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%.","We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at the low end of our long-term operating model target. We anticipate operating margin to be below the low end of our long-term model at approximately 22%, which reflect the impact from increased legal fees and the planned corporate structure reorganization, as well as increased investment in consumer marketing, Invisalign store closure costs, partially offset by the benefit from the Straumann settlement.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe for closing comments.","Joe Hogan","Thanks John and thanks for joining our call today. Before we close I want to comment on a few things that I think are important to remember given our lower than expected Invisalign volumes this quarter and a more cautious outlook for China in Q3.","First, our fundamentals are squarely in place and our outlook for the reminder of the year is clearly within our long term model \u2013 on top of a record 35% last year. We don\u2019t believe the second and third quarter, in anyway, reflects our full potential. Our product technology, operational scale and consumer brand awareness are all significant advantages \u2013 in a huge market that we are addressing with only 10% share today.","The opportunity to bring better smiles to millions is not a zero sum game and we are working hard to ensure that we continue to gain share. So while we acknowledge competition, we also embrace it because it drives our own innovation, which is ultimately great for the millions of global patients who have yet to reap the benefits of this.","Finally, before I open the call up for questions, I want to take a minute to congratulate Simon Beard, who has taken on a new role as Senior VP for the Americas. I also want welcome Markus Sebastian to our executive management team as the new Senior VP of EMEA. As many of you know, Simon was responsible for the market development and operational execution of all products and services in the EMEA region since 2014.","Under Simon\u2019s leadership, the EMEA region has consistently grown more than 30% compound annual growth rate with strong performance across the entire region and customer base. His knowledge of the market and ability to drive strategic programs and initiatives across the region have delivered exceptional results and make him the ideal leader for the Americas region.","Markus joined Align a year ago and has been responsible for Align\u2019s core Europe commercial organizations focused on the orthodontic channel. He has also served as interim GM of Germany and France country markets. Markus is an experienced leader and general manager with a proven track record in global commercial operations and sales, strategic marketing, product development, and change management processes. His deep understanding of the healthcare markets in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. are an asset to Align. We are very glad to have Markus assume responsibility for the EMEA region.","With that, I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming financial conferences and meetings, including the Invisalign GP Summit in November in Las Vegas, where we will also host an analyst meeting. Stay tuned for more information.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Wright","Thanks. Can you parse out some of the components of this sequentially, slower growth in America is where maybe there were pockets of stronger growth that you could at least call out that were obviously offset by some of those competitive dynamics that you were speaking to. And how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression there?","And also where are you seeing most of the competitions coming from? Is it mostly DTC or is it some of component of the GP offerings as well? And how do you expect that to progress? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Hi, Erin. First of all, when you look at the Americas, this is split up \u2013 as the America side includes Latin America and Brazil, which is growing over 100%. There's terrific growth down there. So our focus is mainly when we talk about a little bit of a slow down, it's been in the North American marketplace in the U.S. and Canada.","When you talk about segments that have done well is what I read in my script too is when you look at teens or we call them tweens between seven and 10, they're up 140% year-on-year in the Americas. It's our fastest growing group and that reflects the technology that we've put in place around Invisalign First, which is made for dental expansion in that age of patient and also our Mandibular Advancement product also that I think you know about too.","So that's been a terrific segment for us. Our adult segment too has been strong. It's that 20 to 29 year old that we saw some amount of slow down over time. But when you get into the older classifications, we're still seeing really good strong growth in those areas. So I feel well about our portfolio that I talked about in my script, which is iGo and also our Lite product, can address that segment of 20 to 29 that we think is looking for a price point and also some convenience. We're sure that we can offer through our ortho channels and also our GP channels too. ","On the competition in general is how I framed your second part of your question, when you think about DTC versus I would interpret that as just standard competition. It's really hard to say exactly how to break this up. But in general, we feel that when you look at that specific consumer segment, it's more of a DTC segment. It's not necessarily a traditional segment that they would be appealing to. So in general, I feel good about our positioning. I think our position with orthos and GPs continues to be strong.","I mean, you look at our most \u2013 it was great to be in this field. We were in Asia last week. We were also in North America that I mentioned, the previous week. And we've been involved with a lot of customers. And just what I said in my script, I mean there's \u2013 we know that things are being trot out there from consumer standpoint. We feel so good about the feedback we get about the clinical capabilities of Invisalign, the consistency of it. It's interaction with iTero, which is it's really a master in the marketplace.","And then all of them reaching out to say how they want to compete against that DTC segment, we're the only company that can really join hands with them and help them to compete in that area.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Erin. Next question please.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Block","Great guys. I'm going to try to ask too, an awesome one at a time. So the first long-term guidance is 20% to 30% rev guide, but the guide for next quarter is 17% at the midpoint, it looks like high teens, Joe for the back half of 2019. I know you had some commentary, but I guess the real question is one or two quarters don't make a trend, but how do we put sort of that high teens 2H year-over-year growth guide versus the long-term of 20% to 30% and what would drive the reacceleration and then I'll ask hopefully a tighter follow-up. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Yes, hey Jon. General from a teen standpoint, you know what our product portfolio is and how well it competes in that sense. When we talk about the slow down right now \u2013 the part of it is \u2013 a huge part of it is China and China obviously is a big teen season as we roll into China now. And we're confident we'll be able to perform in that marketplace too, Jon. And there's still demand there. There's just \u2013 after what we saw in the second quarter, we have some basic uncertainty there and that's reflected in what \u2013 and what our guidance is.","But it certainly doesn't decrease our confidence in the sense of our portfolio, our positioning and the movements that we're making in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities that I mentioned in my script. It's a really important part of us expanding in that geography and just giving us more mass in the sense of being exposed to broader patients across that area. So overall, I feel good about that.","Jon Block","Okay. And then just the follow-up there, can you just expand a little bit on the competitive dynamics? You said things seem to work itself out in early 3Q. So what was that Joe? Was that commentary specific more to the traditional ortho channel or there might have been some trialing and then they said, hey, we don't have a comparable product or maybe we could just split what those comments were specific to?","Joe Hogan","Well, they're specific \u2013 they're specific in North America in the ortho channel that you mentioned, Jon. And we see in the first basic 24 days in July, we're seeing a significant uptick in that part of the marketplace. So we say work that out. It just \u2013 it just seems that we've had doctors tell us they've tried these products, they haven't been satisfied with the software or the results that they've had to-date or whatever. And then we see an inflection point from a growth standpoint as we move into July being not significant.","Secondly is when we look at Asia in the July orders also including China, we've seen an uptick in China also. So just in general, I\u2019m talking about, and we're talking about as a team is from a volume standpoint, we've seen an increase in that sense. It gives us confidence that those things are working themselves out.","Jon Block","Okay. Thank you.","Joe Hogan","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Glen Santangelo","No worries. Joe, I just want to talk to you about \u2013 and clearly the competitive landscape seems like its getting worse, but yet you raised your prices on July 1. I mean, are you seeing any price sensitivity in the market? And then when you think about the competitive landscape, put the DTC channel aside for a second. But when you think about the traditional players that are also now selling into the GP in the ortho market, are you seeing any sort of price sensitivity from your customer base at all?","Joe Hogan","Hey, Glen, I start to say, our markets always been price sensitive. And when you look at our portfolio in the sense of how we put things together with our comprehensive product and then our Lite products, products like E5 and E7, the iGo that I talked about too, these have all been positioned to hit a certain price point, not just for doctors, but for doctors with their patients too.","When you talk about competition increasing or whatever, again, it's out there, the traditional players that we know about. I'll talk about the DTC channel in a second. But in general what we find is there's no scale yet. There's no scale on the software side. There's no scale on the supply side. There's a ways to go. There's no challenge in the teen segment results, , it's primarily simple cases on the adult side.","And so it's not that we don't take it seriously, it's just that we feel that we have really strong sales force. The iTero integration with our product line is so strong in that way. It makes it easier for doctors to work with us and to work with patients also. Our operations are unmatched in the sense of \u2013 now we produce half a million to 600,000 aligners a day. It's not easy to do those things. ","So overall as the landscape changing, sure it is. I mean, our key patents ran off at the end of 2017 as you know, we're in the 2019. And we're seeing competition slowly ramp up, but we're not saying that it's been material this quarter. We're just recognizing that it's been out there. On the DTC channel price again, I'll go back to our portfolio, the products like Lite, products like iGo, our simpler products like E7 specifically, those are designed for simple cases. Basically that's what DTC does. They do social six, lower crowding, things that are orthodontically simple. These products have been aligned for that too.","Our job to get those products in our doctor's hands and to get in front of the patients and show them what an opportunity is to work with a doctor and its product line to getting the kind of outcomes that they expect. And also they give them a chance to be able to work with the doctor, hand-in-hand if they don't like the treatment at some point in time, they can continue to progress with that doctor to make it better too.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. I appreciate those comments. Anything regarding ASP, slight downtick sequentially, was it mix, was it discounting or any anything you can add on that front? ","Joe Hogan","For primarily it was exchange, right. And that's what we're leaning into. John, you can\u2026","John Morici","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 like you said, Glen, its down about $15, $10 of that was exchanged and then the rest of it was mix so nothing material from the previous quarter.","Glen Santangelo","Thank you very much.","Joe Hogan","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, just starting in the Americas region, why do you think the DT channel \u2013 the DTC channel was having a negative impact now, you kind of talked about that perhaps having a positive halo effect. And then could you speak to the productivity of the 100 new reps that you've hired and whether or not those are ramping in line with your expectations or not?","Joe Hogan","Yes, hey, Brandon. First of all, on the DTC piece is, I think it's \u2013 there's light and dark in that, right. I do feel that Smile Direct Club and Candid, they've raised the category for awareness significantly. And we hear throughout our doctor base, whether the orthodontic side or GP side, the patients come in asking about clear aligners much more than they have before.","So it forces that conversation that gives them an opportunity to engage at a level that I feel is just our advertising alone, it would have never gotten to that level. So that's a positive side. The negative side is it's \u2013 there's some price competition, that segment offers $2,000 or less kind of a case for simple case and it's pushed some of the doctor office models and it's pushed our portfolio too.","What we're saying is we've always know there's a 10% overlap and educating our customers, having customers be able to, which is our doctors, having this customers be able to use an iTero scanner to help to communicate and visualize exactly what the treatment plan would be. Giving patients some off ramp in the sense that they have issues during the treatment time that they can be addressed by a doctor directly, all those things are things that we just have to make sure we take better advantage of with our doctors and the channels that we work with in order to take advantage of that increased interest that we see out there.","From a new rep standpoint. It was second part of your question, Brandon. We put roughly 100 in North America last year. We watched these statistics. I do, really closely and it's amazing to watch the productivity, what happens. It's like clockwork. It takes nine months. We're certain before they're really up to speed and you can see the productivity versus what our normal territory managers would have.","And as we move into the third quarter, right now, I'm looking at those statistics. We see they're almost, we call it, breadth and reach. And the number of accounts they're calling on and the depth of those accounts are almost equal today. So as we go into the second half of this year, we're really confident about higher productivity with these reps and combine that with our new consumer ad campaign and the breadth of that consumer ad campaign that John talked about. We think will help to drive that demand and with the concierge service increase also, which is significant, will allow us to be able to take advantage of that demand in a way we really couldn't in the past without \u2013 with those resources.","Brandon Couillard","Okay. Thanks for the follow-up. John, could you help us reconcile some of the components of the higher OpEx outlook or the reduced operating margin outlook for the second half. And is the legal and corporate reorganization spend still 150 to 200 basis points in terms of headwind for the year now? Is there any reason that extends perhaps into 2020?","John Morici","No, Brandon. Its the one and a half to two points of expenses that's for the full year for that legal and reorganization. And we don\u2019t expect that to continue into next year.","Brandon Couillard","Okay.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Brandon. Next question?","John Morici","Thanks Brandon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Misra","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones, number one, I think you had said on the last call the gross margin profile at the end of the year, you'd still be kind of towards the low end of that 73% to 78% range. Is that still the case? And then secondly, just a little bit more detail if I may ask for on the dynamics in your North American business. Just curious, are you seeing the detailing more on your lower volume GPs or orthos or who is really feeling the most competitive pressure in terms of your customer base? Thanks.","John Morici","On your first question, Ravi, on the gross margin improvement, we still expect to see sequential improvement. So we've guided up from Q2 for gross margin in the third quarter and we expect that improvement to continue into the fourth quarter.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Ravi, it's Joe. Your second question is dynamics of that, it's a really good question. When we look at that on the GP side, I mean, its hit-and-miss both on the orthos and the GP side. Our orthodontic data for the second quarter indicated there was really a reduction in number of adults that were going through orthodontist. And we know we recognize that.","On a GP side, it hits the GP side also but what we see with our DSO specifically is they're up significantly in growth. I mean, there've been focused on Invisalign to hit it harder. So within that segment of GP, I think the individual practices its hit a little bit harder, the DSOs have really grabbed products like iGo, they\u2019ve institute that in the organization and done much better with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson [Evercore ISI]. Please proceed with your question.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Shirley Stacy","Hey, Elizabeth, we can barely hear you.","Joe Hogan","Hi, Elizabeth.","Elizabeth Anderson","Sorry about that. Can you hear me better now?","Shirley Stacy","That's better.","John Morici","We got it now, yes.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect. Sorry about that. So just in terms of mix in between your comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, can you talk about if there were certain like areas in particular, the non-comprehensive products where you saw like a shift between the first and second quarters?","John Morici","Elizabeth, when you look at that our comprehensive held and they're really well, you remember \u2013 it's really important to remember the comprehensive, our larger size docs like diamond, diamond plus, platinum rely almost exclusively on those product lines because the discount that we give them really it makes it easier for them to be able to move up and down the portfolio. They liked that product line, the comprehensive side only because you get the five year additional aligners.","So when you move to the non-comp in that increase, our Lite product line stood out really well. Our E7 did extremely well and also iGo by far was a real winner in that piece. So you remember a product like iGo too has one individual additional aligner that's offered with it too. So for those kinds of simple cases that also gives the doctors confidence to be able to attack those things with more of a middle range kind of a product.","Elizabeth Anderson","And from an R&D perspective, I know you sort of over time have had like a steady drip of new products, Mandibular Advancement Invisalign First. Is there anything you could sort of talk about that you guys are working on in terms of further clinical advancements?","John Morici","We'd have to chill you, Elizabeth, if we told you that. It's top secret. Okay. It's no a mystery that we've been working on what's called a rapid palatal expander. So when we talk about Invisalign First, you think about that a dental arch expansion product. So you take your teeth that are in your arch and you basically expand those teeth. A palate expander actually takes \u2013 from a morphological standpoint it just widens your mouth completely. That is something we've been working on. I feel we have a good line of sight on how to get that done. There'll be several \u2013 it will be more quarters before we introduce anything like that.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John Kreger","Thanks very much. Joe, can you just expand a little bit more on what you're seeing in China? If you're willing, how much is it slowing? Are you seeing any signs of market maturation and are there any competitive pressures that you're seeing there? Are you seeing it just in terms of a little bit more reticence on the part of the consumer to spend?","Joe Hogan","John, I\u2019ll start with the end of your question. It's a little more reticence on consumers to spend. I mean, you've seen that in other consumer channels, when you look at what's going on, particularly with some U.S.-based companies and obviously the issues that we have between the United States and China right now. As far as the competition goes, John, I'd say Angel Align is a very confident competitor in China from a overall standpoint, but it's not that we feel that there's been any dramatic change in the sense of their competitive positioning or their ability to do certain cases or others.","But maybe we recognize them as a confident competitor, it's just when you look at the different cities too, Tier 3, Tier 4, there's a huge GP area in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 city. That's why we put, iGo and the GP sales force to go into it. The Tier 1 cities are more orthodontic. And so we do segment in that way. When you talk about maturation or some kind of saturation, we just don't feel that.","Again, we're moving into the teen season in China in the third quarters, normally the biggest quarter, obviously there's still a lot of spending that goes on in China around the teen side. And so, no, I honestly feel that this is consumer sentiment in general. It's reflected in other consumer-based businesses. It's not to your point, broadly driven by competition or by any kind of, I'd say saturation of clear aligners in that marketplace. I think we still have a long way to go before we'd ever reach that point.","John Kreger","Great, thanks. And maybe one quick follow-up for this young adult demographic that you\u2019ve been talking about. What other levers do you have to really kind of improve the convenience that they perceive with Invisalign versus other options beyond sort of that classic price trade off?","Joe Hogan","Well, I\u2019d say young adult is, how many doctor visits that they have to make John. And there are some technologies I don\u2019t want to get into right now, but there are more remote technologies that would allow doctor to the CDs patients, less frequently from an office standpoint to be able to monitor their progress remotely.","And I think those kind of things that they hit the convenience side, but it also hits the cost side because the less time they spend in an office there\u2019s less doctor time associated with it. So it\u2019s lower cost too. So there is a convenience and a price point, we think of technology, and doctor understanding of specific kind of products and where \u2013 when and where to use them will allow us to be able to get us that segment better.","John Kreger","Great, thank you.","Joe Hogan","All right, John, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon.","Joe Hogan","Hi, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","First, just one more clarification on China. It embedded in the outlook for the back half. Am I hearing you right that you assumed China actually gets worse? And then John Kreger asked this, but could you put any numbers around China and 2Q and what you\u2019re assuming for the balance of the year?","John Morici","Yes, Steve, this is John. We assume China kind of stays as we\u2019ve seen. So we saw some of that slowed down in the second half of the quarter, second quarter. And we assume that that continues not knowing how that consumer sentiment is going to change over the next few months.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then the email that I\u2019m getting most frequently here is how are they thinking now about the LRP the 20 to 30 growth range beyond the next couple quarters and what are the drivers there? Joe, I appreciated that you\u2019ve called out that the competitive trialing might be in China. We all would imagine gets better. Is that the whole story we feel good about the LRP because of those two things?","Joe Hogan","Yes, we\u2019re sticking to the 20%, 30% with competence, Steve, is nothing that really changed in that sense. And John, you\u2026","John Morici","That\u2019s how we\u2019re allocating resources and investing for that long-term growth model of revenue 20 to 30%. We\u2019re making investments where they\u2019re appropriate and looking for return on those investments to work with our long-term growth model.","Joe Hogan","Yes. Steve, I just reemphasize China\u2019s not going away, right. I mean that\u2019s a big market. It\u2019s a phenomena. The other part that I think we talked about it, but it\u2019s not we just got back we were in Asia last week. It\u2019s not necessarily apparent as the rest of them \u2013 the rest of when you look at APAC is so strong. You have Japan approaching 50% growth rates or more. You have just incredibly strong region overall. We think we\u2019ll get through this China\u2019s situation. It\u2019s going to continue to be our second biggest marketplace. And I feel really good about our investments over there too, because I think it addresses this consumer sentiment piece that we can be more like a Chinese company than be viewed as a just an American company.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks so munch.","Joe Hogan","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Joe Hogan","Yes. Hi Jeff.","John Morici","Hey Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Hey, all. John, I wanted to go back to Brandon\u2019s question just on margins, obviously you reiterated the 150 basis points to 200 basis point impact from the legal and the reorg, and what have you for the year? But the rest of the take down kind of in the second half guidance from a margin perspective ending up around 20% or so. Is that just the increased spend to try to reinvigorate top line or what other kind of levers that 20% operating margin instead of kind of the mid-20s we were thinking?","John Morici","Yes. That gets us low branded are Jeff from the investments that we\u2019re making in marketing. So we\u2019re making those media investments in the third quarter, we\u2019re expected to continue to the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s a reflection in the overall op margin rate that I gave.","Jeff Johnson","Fair enough. And Joe, maybe just a question on [indiscernible] in kind of your confidence that those software glitches issues, whatever the saving issues where all of that rolled into one competence that you\u2019re past that number one. And then maybe talk about your employee base in Costa Rica. Obviously you\u2019ve had a couple of competitors go down there and open treatment planning facilities in pretty close locations. Was that impacting in the second quarter at all? Does that impact over the short-term going forward? Just how to think about that?","Joe Hogan","Yes. Jeff on the software release we had, I mean it was unfortunate, but we \u2013 it\u2019s contained and we know exactly what happened and that\u2019s been cleaned up broadly across the world. On the \u2013 when you think about Costa Rica too, we\u2019ve had a lot of pressure on that organization. It\u2019s not necessarily, because competitors have moved down there and we have lost some employees to them.","It\u2019s just been our capacity. We\u2019ve had \u2013 our growth has been phenomenal. You still look at the stack rates, they\u2019re huge. It takes us \u2013 I think I\u2019ve mentioned before, Jeff, it takes us about six months to add capacity, basically people, technicians to Costa Rica to really get them up to speed where they can deal with customers. And we are a little bit behind the curve on that and customers felt it. This software that we released that you referenced put \u2013 did put pressure on them, because they \u2013 we had to go back and redo some cases in that, obviously put pressure on them, put pressure across our whole customer base when we did that.","But it has nothing to do with SDC obviously has treatment planning down there and some of our more traditional competitors have moved people down there, but we haven\u2019t had an attrition rate that\u2019s significantly different in that area than what we\u2019ve had before. So we\u2019ve added capacity there. We\u2019re going to add more capacity in the second half of this year. So that we can take care of some of the increases in volume we see at times. Because if you \u2013 when you do see these increases in volume, it\u2019s not like they go away in two weeks, they ripple through this organization for 30 days or 40 days and we need to be able to have some little extra capacity to allow us to be able to address that.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","All right, thanks, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, as I think about the quarter and the outlook for the business, I continually hear that Align has better products from clinicians. That\u2019s clear. It\u2019s just it seems like in the marketplace that message is being heard. So I\u2019m wondering what you can do to turn things around there. I know there are some of these investments, but can you be more specific on how you turn things around in North America somewhat quickly with these investments and the same goes for China where it\u2019s a consumer product, it\u2019s not a medically necessary product versus us encountering kind of a slow bleed as you have more competition in both geographies over the next several years.","Joe Hogan","Matthew, I\u2019m not sure how to talk about the competition part more than what I have so far, right. We \u2013 I think we\u2019ve categorized them well. We know what their capabilities are. It\u2019s somewhat limited. When you say how to get at that, when some of these cases are offered for free or they\u2019re offered for $800 or $750, some more of those are going to try it. If I was an ortho, I tried too, given where we\u2019ve been in the marketplace and where our prices are or whatever and so.","I think that\u2019s just part of the competitive environment or whatever, but we\u2019re being very clear about we don\u2019t see a systemic loss to our traditional competitors in any way. So I don\u2019t want to infer that at all either. From a China\u2019s standpoint, look China, again, I think we talk about that in a few other calls, a few seconds ago, China continued to be strong. Consumer sentiment, there is consumers sentiment. We\u2019re going to continue to invest there. We\u2019re going to put more salespeople in place. We\u2019ll follow through with continuing our training centers or manufacturing centers all we put in place. And we expect to China continue to grow and be \u2013 for the foreseeable future, the second largest area that we sell to. John, you can\u2026","John Morici","Sorry.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Okay. And then everybody is focusing on the negatives here and there\u2019s I get that, but there was some positives in the quarter. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about you started touching on it a bit, but the iTero number, I know there was some seasonality to it was just phenomenal again. Some of that\u2019s DSO related I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about outside the DSOs what was driving that. And when we expect to see a lot more of that volume from all the iTero placements, and same thing goes with doc training, I think those are some of the best numbers that we\u2019ve seen in a while, when some of that training may manifest into higher volumes for the entire organization.","Joe Hogan","I appreciate a positive comment like because there were a lot of good things in this quarter. One thing you missed is you look EMEA up 39% in the consistency of the growth across that EMEA region. It\u2019s really been amazing in that sense. I mentioned the other parts of APAC too strong growth that we saw. And again, we verified that last week when we were over to see the team. And in North America side, I mean when you look at these tweens, 7 to 10, up 140% and some of our other age groups, they\u2019ve been very extremely strong. DSO marketplace has been great for us. And GP is still growing double-digits and is not taken for granted in this business because we\u2019ve had some terrible, you\u2019d go back years ago of GP growth that we saw double-digits. We\u2019re continued to do well in that segment. But you pointed to iTero specifically in, I mean, it was a really an amazing quarter for iTero.","So you have world-leading technology in iTero and with our 5D launch, it wasn\u2019t available in the United States. It\u2019s not yet. We\u2019re still working through the FDA, but in other parts of the world it hasn\u2019t made available. We\u2019re seeing both orthos and dental \u2013 dentists or general practitioners are really interested in that product line too. We have good sales force, combined with our iTero sales force. It\u2019s direct, but also with our Invisalign sales force too.","And more and more, as it\u2019s no secret that dental is going digital. To starts the whole digital piece, the front end of it as a scanner, having to kind of technology we have with iTero. You can see in some of the statistics that I mentioned in my opening, 13.7 million scans done. I think 3.8 million that were done for restorative scans, meaning they had really nothing to do for the most part with Invisalign in that sense, kind of shows you the versatility of that product line too.","So those areas are very strong in the area. Talked about doc training, we did have some terrific numbers across all geographies for the quarter. That\u2019s always a strong leading indicator of doc\u2019s interest in future Invisalign cases. It breaks down differently by different regions to how fast they\u2019ll go. But as an overall, signal in the sense of what\u2019s in front of us and the interest from a doctor\u2019s standpoint, the doctor training thing is good and I\u2019m glad you picked up on it.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Thank you.","Joe Hogan","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Steve.","Steven Valiquette","Hey, guys. So nothing get too granular on what transpired over the past three, four months, but just coming back to the June quarter case volume for a moment. I guess, when you guys provided guidance for 2Q, obviously, that was in late April. Then you guys we had a lot of conferences through mid-June, with the message and everything seemed, okay. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if most of these negative pressure points hits you maybe late in the quarter and in the month of June in particular. And when we come back to your comment that in North America, you\u2019re seeing improving trends in the first few weeks of Q3 and you just comparing July to June in particular. Just curious to kind of get little more color of how things kind of transpired throughout the quarter as we think about some of these pros and cons in the results. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Steve. Like you said, not to be over granular though. I think China by far was one where \u2013 when you\u2019ve got the June and all, it was more difficult than what we had anticipated. Our China team is terrific too. So you do count on these guys to be able to deliver toward end of the quarter. And we see that, time and time again, it just didn\u2019t materialize and that consumer sound, that piece became more and more visible to us, as we got through the quarter in that way.","In North America, I\u2019d say in general, we were good with the team volume was up 24%, same as what we had in the previous quarter up 24% too. So there wasn\u2019t really a team issue from a North America standpoint. But we did see some slowdown, as we went into the quarter also. As you think about July in general and we talk about that increase, we\u2019re not just comparing it to June, we\u2019re talking about the entire quarter, the first and second quarters and what we at, when we talk about that increased us, we wouldn\u2019t mention it.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. I appreciate the after color. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ryskin","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick one on the follow-up quarter and then one just to follow-up again on something that, Steve just touched on with the last one. First, start with the 3Q, if you just sort of look at your commentary on international, sequentially down with the China pressures and you\u2019ll get U.S. North America. Even if you\u2019ll count for the 2% impact you had at Q2 last year. It seems like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive cut the North America outlook. So I\u2019m just wondering how much conservative is little to that, especially since your point on improving trends in the first part of July. I guess I\u2019m saying is \u2013 was it really kitchen sink guide or sort of what\u2019s your outlook there.","John Morici","Mike, this is John. Really, there\u2019s no change in how we guide, we look at a lot of factors and understanding of the market being a few weeks into the quarter. So we\u2019re \u2013 no change in terms of how we guide. We\u2019re just trying to put the pieces that we see. And as we mentioned with 2Q, we had some slow down, primarily China in June. And we want to be reflective of what we see. So no change in how we guide. We give our best estimate at a point in time. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Michael Ryskin","All right. I appreciate that. And quick follow-up again, just going into the sort of the bridge in 2Q, if you look at where international came in versus expectations may have been a little bit life, but it feels like the majority of the delta was actually in North America and especially on your comments on just June softness in China. We know roughly how big your China businesses for you. So it shouldn\u2019t have been that meaningful of an impact, especially if it was only a one month dynamic. So is there anything going on outside of China? I mean, is there anything that you can comment on in terms of your local presence there? You\u2019ve got the manufacturing as they built out. You\u2019ve got some of your other facilities that you\u2019re establishing there. Any other dynamics and play besides just the June consumer sentiment?","John Morici","Nothing that we saw out of the ordinary, Mike. It was \u2013 we looked at the demand that we saw \u2013 some of the pressure that we saw in June. But it was around the consumer sentiment, like, Joe said, that China team delivers quarter-after-quarter. So we felt very confident that we\u2019ve got a great business there in terms of the investments that we\u2019ve made in treatment planning and now manufacturing and training centers and so on. So we\u2019re continuing to invest in grow, just calling a number that we see.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for squeezing me in. John, actually just had a question on the ASP outlook, and how we should be thinking about that sequentially. And as you look going forward, do you have any change in kind of promotional activity or discount? It\u2019s kind of big into how you\u2019re thinking about, where ASP is trend from here.","John Morici","Yes, Nate. When we think about ASP is and really what we saw at the end of \u2013 we guided for at the end of last year was essentially flat ASPs. We have puts and takes as you know, with our business between international growth and comprehensive versus non-comprehensive. But what we\u2019ve seen through this year and our Q3 guide is consistent to the fact that notwithstanding FX, we expect it to be about flat as we go through. So we have puts and takes to it, but from an overall ASP that is flat. And the promotions that we have, like we have every quarter, no different, in terms of how we\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re trying to drive, increase utilization, trying to drive growth in our business and promotions continuous as usual.","Nathan Rich","Okay, I appreciate that. And then just with the case guidance for 3Q. Is it possible to just kind of give us a sense in terms of orders of magnitude in the step down in the growth rate? How much was from the slowdown that you saw in China versus maybe a more competitive environment in North America? Just as we think about the relative impact of those factors.","John Morici","Yes, Nate, most of what we saw, that slowdown or the guidance that we gave was related to China. Like you said, we saw this in June and that\u2019s a reflection of how we\u2019ve guided. So the majority of that was related to China.","Nathan Rich","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John Morici","All right, Nate. See you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Nate. And thank you everyone for joining us. This concludes our conference call today.

Tom?","Tom Prescott","Thanks Shirley. Good afternoon everyone. On the call today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of preliminary fourth quarter results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments Invisalign clear aligners and scanner and CAD\/CAM services. Ken will cover Q4 financial results and the outlook for Q1 in more detail and then I\u2019ll come back with a few closing comments and open the call to your questions.","I\u2019m very pleased to report solid fourth quarter, which culminated in a record fiscal year with over 70% growth for Invisalign volume reflecting continued adoption and increased utilization. Our continuing focus on Invisalign product evolution, market expansion and share gains are the core of this growth.","Q4 revenues were at the high-end of guidance. Even without the positive effects from the release of $4.9 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign case refinement which Ken is going to cover more in detail shortly. Better than expected Q4 revenues reflect increased Invisalign ASPs due to lower Advantage rebates driven by lower utilization in Q4 especially among our North American Orthodontists. In addition, we got some lift for international sales from favorable foreign exchange rates.","Let\u2019s start with an overview of key highlights for Invisalign. And for Q4, total Invisalign case volume was 90,500, an increase of 10% year-over-year and a decrease of 2% sequentially. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower volume from North American customers. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by North American Orthodontists and international doctors and compares to an especially strong Q4 a year ago, Q4 of 2011 which increased 30% year-over-year and 4% sequentially over Q3 of 2011.","As reported previously, in Q4 we saw continued softness in Invisalign case volume due to broader market conditions as well as disruption of our customers\u2019 practices from super storm Sandy. This major storm affected our customers in the Mid-Atlantic and North Eastern region with the greatest impact on the major metropolitan areas in New York and New Jersey.","We saw a change in Invisalign case volume and practice patterns after the storm hit those areas which continued throughout the quarter. While fairly few practices experienced serious damage, most reported delayed or cancelled patient appointments or consultations which impacted their case starts. When we compare the affected area relative to the rest of the U.S., we estimate that we lost approximately 1,000 to 1,500 cases in Q4. Many residents in the area are getting back to normal, but we can\u2019t predict when these perspectives patients will start to seek Invisalign treatment again.","Notwithstanding the impact from Sandy, overall Invisalign case submissions rebounded in December and this trend continued into the first quarter of 2013. Overall, we\u2019ve seen uptick in North American case receipts reflecting increased patient traffic in our customers\u2019 offices as well as traction from customer engagement and practice development activities.","We\u2019ve also seen increased customer interest in Invisalign related to the launch of SmartTrack, our next generation aligner material which is commercially available now.","North American Orthodontists Q4 case volume of 33,500 cases declined 7% sequentially, due primarily to the expected decrease in Invisalign Teen case starts. Year-over-year, over North American Ortho customers increased case volume by 12% driven primarily by Invisalign team reflecting our continued share gains in this very important Teenager Orthodontic segment.","To top it off, we\u2019ve seen strong adoption of Invisalign Express 5, our cost effective treatment for very minor fixes which was launched commercially a year ago and is targeted at our higher volume ortho customers.","During Q4, we ran a promotion, a new promotion which offered doctors $200 of less price for Invisalign Express 5 which was intended to drive higher trial and repeat usage and we\u2019ve seen good uptick on it as a result.","Our North American GP dentists Q4 case volume of 34,600 cases was essentially flat from last quarter and reflects an increase in Invisalign Express offset by a decrease in Invisalign Teen just fairly typical coming off the summer Teen season. On a year-over-year basis, North American GP has increased 5% driven primarily by Invisalign Express. Even admitting industry slow down, our performance in this channel has been solid.","For our customers outside of North America, Invisalign volume of 22,300 increased 2% sequentially reflecting a seasonal rebound in Europe. This growth in Europe was offset primarily by a decrease from our Asia-Pacific distributor which is historically down in Q4. On a year-over-year basis, international volume increased 14% reflecting growth from almost every country as well as increased utilization of all products, especially for Invisalign fall. Growth also reflects positive response to new predictability features of Invisalign like Invisalign G4 introduced over the past year or so.","In our direct European geographies, Q4 sequential growth was driven by a rebound in Italy as well as growth in France and CEU countries of Germany, Switzerland and Austria. We were also up a bit in Spain albeit of a small base despite a very challenging economic environment there. Q4 year-over-year growth was led by the UK, France and CEU countries.","We\u2019ve seen strong acceptance of Invisalign i7 in UK equally across GP and Ortho channels. We expect our i7 offering will also benefit from renewed interest for less complex treatments as we launch it across Europe.","In terms of teenage orthodontics market in Europe, we don\u2019t see the same seasonal pattern in North America experiences and so Invisalign Teen was up sequentially and year-over-year. Our recent product technology innovation is resulting in improved clinical confidence in greater acceptance for Invisalign to treat those teen cases. In addition, we continued to successfully build on our consumer campaign called the right byte in the CEU countries.","We\u2019re also now seeing increased utilization of Invisalign Teen in France which is especially the case among our highest volume customers where now using Invisalign on more of their teen patients.","As you may recall, we hold large scale customer events called Invisalign Summits every other year for our channel ortho, GP in North America and then international and in between those, we hold a serious of smaller venues called Invisalign forums.","In Q4, we held a series of forums in Spain, France and UK with high customer attendance and peer to peer learning focused on sharing of clinical techniques and case studies for more complex malocclusions.","Turning to our direct Asian country markets of Japan and China, we continue to make great progress, both of which had very strong year-over-year growth. Growth in China has been driven by our continued focus on executing our strategy of working with key opinion in Orthodontists in the primary cities which bodes well for the long-term health of our business.","In Q4, we cosponsored a clear aligner therapy meeting with Capital University, a major thought leader in China. More than 80 important orthodontists attend to hear experts present on Invisalign advancements and techniques. We have a strongly engaged customer base that is increasingly recommending Invisalign to their colleagues and their patients.","Overall, 2012 was a great year of progress in China and we are excited about opportunities for continuing to build our business in 2013. In fact, earlier this month, we held an Invisalign key user meeting bringing together the top 15 Invisalign trained orthodontists in China, many of them are now lecturing and teaching their peers about the Invisalign technique.","Shifting to our Invisalign distributors in the APCA, EMEA and Latin America regions, Q4 was down sequentially across all three distributors primarily due to seasonality. Year-over-year volume growth of 30% was driven by continued strength in the APAC region followed by EMEA and the Latin America regions. Our Asia-Pacific distributor region is comprised of wide geography covering 12 countries including larger more advanced markets in Australia and Hong Kong.","As we disclosed last quarter, we are bringing most of this geography back in-house starting May 1. At that time, we will begin to recognize direct sales at our full ASP rather than the significantly discounted ASP under the distribution agreement. In the near-term, operating expense from assuming the direct team there will offset the uplift ASPs, but as volumes ramp we would expect to have a much higher contribution margin on this business.","This means that roughly 3% of worldwide revenue that Asia-Pacific accounts for today become even more meaningful contributor to top line growth beginning in May of this year. While we often talk about the importance of product in clinical innovation to drive adoption utilization growth in North America, the fact remains that it even more important outside North America given the significantly greater complexity of cases treated.","As a result, the set of innovations we\u2019ve introduced over the few years really resonates with international doctors and has been a key to increasing their confidence in Invisalign. We expect this trend to continue with the recent launch of SmartTrack and Invisalign G4 feature enhancements particularly in Europe with its innovations will be the focus of numerous launch events throughout Q1 and Q2.","We continue to focus on expanding our customer base primarily with North American GPs and international doctors as well as increasing utilization among new and existing practices. Year-over-year utilization was essentially flat reflecting continued adoption growth by North America orthos offset a bit by North American GPs and international doctors.","Sequentially, utilization was down a bit consistent with lower volume for North American orthos. Q4 saw lower utilization among our highest volume doctors which also accounts to lower Advantage rebates paid off. In Q4 of 2012, we trained a total of 1,775 new Invisalign doctors by channel we added 75 North American orthodontists, 920 North American GPs, and 780 international doctors.","For the full year, Invisalign growth was driven primarily by the continued expansion of our customer base as we trained a total 6,845 new Invisalign doctors which reflects the addition of 388 North American orthos, 3,305 North American GPs, 3,150 international doctors. For international, around 50% new doctors were in our direct country markets and the other 50% were in our distributor geographies.","Moving on to product innovation, on January 21st, we announced that our next generation liner material SmartTrack is now the standard of liner material for Invisalign clear aligners in North America and it will be commercially available in all the international markets where regulatory approvals been obtained February 4th.","We previously highlighted SmartTrack in the Q3 call and since many of you have reviewed the press release, I\u2019ll touch in a few key points here. SmartTrack is a highly elastic proprietor new aligner material that delivers consistently low force to improve the control tooth movements within Invisalign clear aligner therapy. Orthodontic literature sites consistent lower moderate force as ideal for ensuring predictable tooth movement.","The elasticity in SmartTrack also appears to offer greater patient comfort and easier removal of aligners. In combination with our other innovation such as Invisalign G3 and G4, our customers have told us that SmartTrack is already delivering greater predictability and in turn inspiring greater confidence to use more Invisalign.","A record 5,900 of our customers registered for the SmartTrack Ask the Expert webinar we held on January 18th, the largest number ever registered for one of these webinars. Following the call, we received 3,000 survey responses regarding the impact of SmartTrack and this webinar on their future use of Invisalign.","The survey responded stated that based on the webinar and their knowledge of SmartTrack, 95% sense their confidence in Invisalign was positively improved and 90% said they were likely to recommend Invisalign to their patients more frequently, great feedback. So feedback in this webinar reinforces what we already learned about SmartTrack from our large scale pilot that began last May, announces of over 1,000 patients treated with SmartTrack shows statistically significant improvement in controlled tooth movements especially for the most difficult such as rotations and extrusions.","And to quote Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist and a member of our Clinical Advisory Board, he says, \u201cThe fit around the teeth from aligner to aligner is better than with any group of patients I\u2019ve previously treated with Invisalign. Without a doubt, SmartTrack is the most exciting change in Invisalign technology among the many that have been introduced in recent years.\u201d","The Align team is committed to extending this continuum of product and technology innovation to improve the performance of clear aligner therapy. We\u2019re pleased with the initial response to SmartTrack and are excited about the potential to help drive continued adoption and utilization growth for Invisalign worldwide.","Overall, 2012 was a year of significant investment to extend and sustain our growth in North America and internationally.","Our go-to-market approach in North America is based on a team of territory managers, and to a lesser extent territory specialist which we deploy to enhance coverage in larger territories especially with the mix of lower volume GPs.","Over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve piloted different coverage and deployment models and found that territory specialists are particularly successful and cost effective in building our base of GP customers. We see this is the right time to invest in incremental coverage in high growth or heavily concentrated areas with a large number of low volume GP customers.","In 2013, we will add sales headcount at North America and in Europe with the bulk of those in North America. In direct geographies, it typically takes several quarters to bring new sales reps up to speed and we are comfortable that we\u2019ll get good ROI on our investment in this coverage. In addition, we\u2019ll add approximately 15 reps by bringing the Asia-Pacific team back in the direct sales organization.","Turning to consumer, our integrated consumer marketing platform is traditionally focused on an North American market and combined paid media like print, broadcast and digital along with the mix of PR, event marketing and social media outreach. The goal of this platform is to raise awareness of Invisalign and Invisalign Teen as the best options for healthy beautiful smile among adults especially for moms as well as teens.","In addition, it is important for us to help these potential patients find a great practice that could meet their needs. Growth in activity and greater engagement on our consumer website are good measures of progress in this front as we help educate perspective patients and direct them to get more information to take an interactive smile assessment based on their own goals for treatment and search for Invisalign providers in their own area.","We ended 2012 with more than 5.4 million visitors to Invisalign.com for the year, up 23% from 2011. Website leads were up over 33% year-over-year and find a doctor search were also up nicely from 2011. We continued to see increase in traffic for mobile device users with visitors to the Invisalign.com mobile site making up around a quarter of our total traffic especially when our ads are on TV.","All these metrics tell us that perspective patients remain interested and learning more about Invisalign treatment and connected with providers in their local area.","As of mid-January in North America, we were back on TV with advertising and expect to be consistently on air throughout 2013 with no more than two consecutive weeks off air until December. We also have a new North American consumer campaign in development that we expect to launch around Memorial Day to leverage the summer teen season. And we look forward to sharing more about that strategic initiative when ready.","Within Europe, to build on the consumer marketing front, we are launching an integrated consumer campaign in all five direct European country markets this month. For the first time in Europe, we\u2019ll be sponsoring TV programs in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK\/Ireland under the campaign theme \u201cSmile and the whole world smiles with you!!\u201d","As part of our TV sponsorships we will also have extensive presence on each of the TV stations web sites. The TV sponsorships will be supported by campaigns across Align\u2019s social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as online through display and banners ads and an extensive search engine marketing program.","We\u2019ve partnered with one of the world\u2019s largest publishers of monthly magazines, Hearst, to further spread our message in consumer print and online titles and will continue to engage with local consumer media to ensure our markets are educated about Invisalign.","Moving to our scanner and CAD\/CAM Services segment, Q4 revenue was $10 million compared to $9.8 million in Q3 and $10 million in Q4 last year. And yet reflects strong growth of scanner sales in North America offset by lower services revenues.","Q4 North American scanner shipments grew 23% year-over-year and 59% sequentially, reflecting positive impact from sales at the Invisalign Ortho Summit in November as well as a $4,000 year-end promotion that was very successful.","Even with this strong growth in North America, it was not enough to offset the gap in Europe. It\u2019s clear we have the right model in North America where are successfully leveraging Invisalign resources in events and customer relationships. Over time, we will evaluate the best path forward to restage growth in Europe and the rest of the world.","In addition to increase scanner sales in North America, we continued to see increased synergy between our chair-side technology and Invisalign treatments. This increasing trend and a percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scan rather than a traditional physical impression rose to 17% in Q4 compared to 14% in Q3 and 6% in Q4 a year ago.","We also continued to see an increase in Invisalign utilization among scanner customers, particularly orthodontists and expect this positive trend to continue. The drivers for this growth come from better customer and patient experience along with recent scanner innovations including the new iTero scanner launching next month, which is garnering great early feedback.","In addition, the recently launched Invisalign Outcome Simulator brings a valuable patient education to all chair-side to help doctor show the benefits of Invisalign treatments to perspective patients.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken for review of our Q4 financial results. Ken.","Ken Arola","Thanks Tom. Before I begin, I want to provide a brief update on the status of our goodwill impairment for the Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services reporting unit.","In Q4 2012, we finalized the step two analyses and recorded an additional $11.9 million impairment to goodwill. We had previously recorded a preliminary estimate of $24.7 million of goodwill impairment in quarter three 2012, bringing the total goodwill impairment to $36.6 million.","Now let\u2019s review our fourth quarter financial results beginning with revenue. Q4 net revenue was a total of $142.8 million which consisted of Invisalign revenue of $132.8 million and Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services revenue of $10 million. This is a sequential increase of 4.6% from $136.5 million in quarter three 2012 and a year-over-year increase of 10.8% from $128.9 million in quarter four 2011.","The sequential increase in revenue primarily reflects higher Invisalign ASPs which benefitted from lower than expected Advantage rebates and favorable foreign exchange rates.","Q4 2012 Invisalign revenue of $132.8 million, increased 4.8% compared to Q3 revenue of $126.7 million, increased 11.7% compared to Q4 2011 revenue of $118.9 million.","Q4 Invisalign revenue includes the release of $4.9 million of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign case refinements. Case refinement gives a doctor the option to additional aligners typically during the final few stages of treatment if further chose movement is needed in order to meet the original treatment goals.","Aligned defers revenue for case refinement when an Invisalign case shifts. In Q4 2012, we determined that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and as a result, we released $4.9 million of revenue deferred for the case refinements.","Adjusting for this one-time favorable impact of $4.9 million, Invisalign revenue for Q4 was $127.9 million, up slightly from Q3 and an increase of 7.6% year-over-year. As mentioned, Q4 Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services was $10 million, this was a sequential increase of 2.1% from $9.8 million in Q3 2012 and was flat year-over-year.","Now moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Q4 GAAP gross margin was $106.5 million or 74.5%. This compares to $100.4 million or 73.5% in quarter three, and $95.6 million or 74.1% in the same quarter last year.","Q4 GAAP gross margin was Invisalign was 78.8% and Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services gross margin was 18.5%. This compares to 77.6% and 20.6% respectively in quarter three.","Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was $106.7 million or 74.7%. This compares to $100.7 million or 73.7% in quarter three, and $96.5 million or 74.9% in the same quarter last year.","For Invisalign, there was no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the periods Q4 or Q3 2012 and Q4 2011. The sequential increase in gross margin primarily reflects higher ASPs and lower manufacturing spend.","For Scanner and CAD\/CAM services, Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 20.5% compared to 23.8% last quarter and 30% in Q4 2011. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin is primarily ASP driven as it reflects the $4,000 promotion for iTero Scanners in quarter four.","Q4 GAAP operating expense was $89.4 million compared to Q3 operating expense of $95.8 million. Operating expense for the same quarter last year was $69.1 million. GAAP operating expense includes a goodwill impairment charges of $11.9 million in Q4 2012 and $24.7 million in Q3 2012.","Q4 non-GAAP operating expense was $76.6 million. This compares to $70 million in Q3 and $56.9 million in the same quarter last year.","The increase in Q4 non-GAAP operating expense is primarily due to severance cost, legal fees and a greater number of industry meetings including the ADA and Greater New York Dental Show. In addition, we hold a number of major customer events in Q4 including our North America Ortho Summit and a series of Invisalign forums in Europe.","Q4 operating income was $17.1 million or 12%, this compares to $5.4 million or 3.3% in quarter three and $26.4 million or 20.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $30 million or 21% and this compares to $30.6 million or 22.4% in Q3 and $29.7 million or 23% in the same quarter last year.","Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.12 compared to $0.00 in Q3 and $0.25 in the same quarter last year. And Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, was $0.27 compared to $0.28 in quarter three and $0.28 in Q4 of last year.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including long-term investments were $356.1 million. This is compared to $248.1 million at the end of 2011. In Q4, we generated roughly $50.8 million in cash from operations compared to $40.3 million in quarter three and $42 million in the same quarter last year.","During quarter four, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average of $26.41 a share for a total approximately $37 million. There remains approximately $95.5 million available under the company\u2019s existing stock repurchase authorization.","Q4 DSOs were 62 days compared to 70 days in quarter three and 64 days in the same quarter last year.","Before I move on to the Q1 outlook, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on the full year results.","Revenue was a record $560 million, up 16.7% compared to $479.7 million in 2011. Adjusting for the one-time impact of $4.9 million release of previously deferred revenue for Invisalign case refinement, revenue for the year was $555.1 million, up 15.7% year-over-year reflecting solid growth in all channels, especially North America Orthos and International doctors.","In 2012, we shifted 363,500 Invisalign cases, up 17.5% compared to 309,300 cases in 2011. From a geographic standpoint, North America volumes increased 16% and international volumes increased 22.7% year-over-year.","GAAP operating income for the year was $85.6 million or 15.3% compared to $90.4 million or 18.8% in 2011. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $128.6 million or 23% compared to $104.7 million or 21.8% in 2011.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.71 for 2012 compared to $0.83 in 2011 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.17 compared to $0.97 in 2011. For the full year, we generated $133.8 million in cash from operations compared to $130.5 million in 2011 and we bought back 1.7 million shares of Align stock for total of $47.2 million.","Now let\u2019s turn to our business outlook for Q1 2013 and the factors that inform our view.","2013 is off to a good start. Our customers report patient traffic flow in their office has picked up towards the end of the fourth quarter and has continued into 2013. We expect our North America business to benefit from the increased activity and volume trends we are seeing, as well as the price increase for clear aligners and iTero scanners.","At the same time, as doctors increase their utilization we are anticipating higher Advantage rebate participation and we\u2019re expecting some product mix shift to lower ASP products like Invisalign Express 5.","In North America, we anticipate Invisalign case volume for the GP channel to be flat to slightly up in quarter one and North America Ortho channel to be up nicely from a seasonally softer quarter four. In International, we would expect Q1 case volume to be flat to down as doctors have more days out of the office in Q1 for winter holidays.","In Q1, we will begin to consolidate Vivera Retainer product shipments down to one shipment per year, compared to the current process of four shipments per year. Consolidating the shipments is something our customers have asked for as it will make it more efficient for their practice. As a result, our Q1 outlook reflects a higher amount of Vivera revenue than in the past as we will be recognizing the full Vivera case revenue upon shipment instead of recognizing it ratably over four quarters.","The net impact will be a $4 million benefit to Q1 revenue. In addition, we will also begin to realize reduced freight costs as we make this change.","For Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services, Q4 is typically the strongest quarter for dentists and specialist to purchase capital equipment. As such, we would expect Q1 sales to be down sequentially from Q4.","So with that as a backdrop, Q1 Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in a range of 95,000 to 97,500 cases reflecting 11.4% to 14.3% year-over-year growth. We expect Q1 total revenues to be in a range of $146 million to $150.5 million. We expect gross margins to be in a range of 72.4% to 73.1%. The sequential decrease in gross margin primarily reflects a slightly higher material cost for the SmartTrack material as well as a planned inventory reserve for current safety stock of our previous clear aligner materials.","In Q4, we expect operating expenses to be in a range of $82.8 million to $84.4 million. The sequential increase in operating expense relates to higher annual compensation and employee benefits, consumer programs including the development of the new consumer advertising campaign Tom mentioned and incremental sales headcount. Also beginning in Q1, operating expense will include the new medical revised excised tax.","We expect Q1 operating margin to be in a range of 15.8% to 17.1% and earnings per share to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23. In Q1, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 83 million and cash on hand to be in a range of $365 million to $375 million excluding any stock repurchases.","Now I\u2019d like to provide some directional comments on full year 2013.","From a revenue perspective, we believe we are focused on the right strategic levers and with our expanded product platform, we believe we will continue to grow and gain share during the year. The ASP impact from the price increase for Invisalign in North America that was effective as of January 1st, will be offset somewhat by the expected increase in Advantage rebates as we\u2019re anticipating doctors will continue to increase utilization of Invisalign, as well as increased volume from lower price products including Express 5 and Invisalign i7.","We believe we can maintain our gross margins in the lower end of the long-term model of 73% to 78%. Factors that can impact our gross margin structure, either positive or negative, are significant shifts in case volume quarter-to-quarter, movements in foreign exchange rates, particularly the Euro, and levels of Advantage rebates and promotional discounts attained by our customers.","2013 will be a year of investment in areas around sales coverage in North America and Europe, bringing the Asia Pacific channel back in-house with approximately 50 employees; the development of a new consumer campaign and being on air more consistently in 2013, and our continued focus on product technology and innovation.","To believe, there will be some quarterly fluctuations from Q1 levels during the year due to timing and amounts of spend relative to consumer marketing, sales force expansion, and significant trade show and industry events.","Given the rebound in case receipts in December, which have continued into Q1 and assuming patient traffic continues to improve, we\u2019re confident about our top line growth resuming and expect operating margins to approach the low end of our operating margin targets as we exit the year.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I\u2019d like to make one other brief comment. Right now you probably seen the announcement that I will be stepping down as CFO of Align. Over the next month, I will continue in my current capacity to ensure that we complete all year-end activities and including the filing of our 10-K.","Beyond that, I will transition my responsibilities and an employee through June. I have truly enjoyed being a part of great team to bring the company to where it is today and wish continued success for Align. It was also been a pleasure to have the opportunity to meet and get to know many of you over the past several years and I wish you all the best as well.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Tom for some closing comments.","Tom Prescott","Before I move to some closing comments, I want to thank Ken for his service over the past seven years, he\u2019s earned some downtime and as he is really going to enjoy that. Thank you so much. We have a search underway for a new CFO and expect to complete that by the end of Q2. During the interim, Roger George will formally pickup responsibility to the finance team and service interim CFO.","Now to wrap up our comments. Q4 was a very solid end to a year of record Invisalign case volume and revenues. Despite slower growth in the back half of the year, our strong first half performance helped drive nearly 17% Invisalign case growth with 16% North America and 23% international.","We had many significant accomplishments this past year that contributed to that growth, including entry into new market segments with the launch of Invisalign Express 5 and Invisalign i7, expansion into new emerging country markets, and the unveiling of our next generation aligner material SmartTrack, which began commercial shipments two weeks ago.","We are starting off the New Year with several new products and feature enhancements including the new iTero scanner, Invisalign Outcome Simulator, and Invisalign G4 Enhancements which are all commercially available in Q1 of this year.","In addition, our customers are reporting improving trends in patient traffic in their offices and for Invisalign case starts. That near term trend, along with our low penetration into the overall orthodontic market, reinforces our long-term view of top line growth of 15% or higher.","Ken covered our framework for 2013 and assuming patient traffic continues to improve, we believe this will be another solid year in terms of Invisalign case starts.","So to summarize; 2012 was a year of delivering solid results in a tough environment, with very positive progress for our customers and while initiating a set of important organizational changes for the company. 2013 will be another important year for us as we commercialize SmartTrack, integrate the APAC team back into Align, launch new products, and accelerate our marketing programs. We are committed to becoming a market leader in dentistry and will continue to build the team to deliver on that goal.","All of these investments in product, programs, and our internal team are focused on one thing, getting us to the day when even our most conservative customers feel confident saying \u201cevery case is an Invisalign case.\u201d","I really look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. And with that, operator, let\u2019s get to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Shirley Stacy","John, are you there?","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","I am. Can you hear me?","Tom Prescott","Yes, now we can. Thanks.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","Great, thanks. Tom, can you give us an update on where you think the broader orthodontic market is trending in terms of case start volumes?","Tom Prescott","We certainly aren\u2019t the whole market. We\u2019re just a thin slice. Our sense is certainly in the second half of the year it was a tough place. Our orthodontists all reported softer volumes. It was a decent teen year summer, but I think adults kind of slipped away from everybody. So in general, we would target total segment growth in low single digits, us being able to take share has helped us fuel our growth.","So we don\u2019t think it\u2019s been healthy. We do, our customers do report increased patient traffic calendar is filling up with consult in a good way, nothing explosive in growth but solid progress. So we think that points us some improvement. In ortho total starts, and we think with that happening we can get more than our fair share.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","Great, thanks very much. I think the one topic maybe you didn\u2019t cover in your prepared remarks. Can you just give us an update on the IT front and then what we can expect out of the ITC trial that I think starts in a week or two?","Tom Prescott","Better than having me comment, we have Roger George here. Roger, if you can turn your microphone and just to give a brief commentary. Thank you.","Roger George","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon everybody. As we\u2019ve disclosed, the ITC trial begins next week in Washington DC. If you know much about that administrative law forum, it works differently than a typical federal court and so called Article III court under the U.S. Constitution. The administrative legal courts at the ITC have their own set of rules, live witness testimony is quite limited. Most testimony is submitted in writing for the court\u2019s consideration. So we\u2019ve all submitted our briefs. Ours was about 600 pages long that staffing submitted its brief and naturally ClearCorrect submitted theirs because it contains what\u2019s called confidential business information; I\u2019m not even allowed to know much of what is in ClearCorrect\u2019s brief, only our outside lawyers get to know.","So the trial will happen over the course of about a week and the judge doesn\u2019t rule from the bench. He takes everything under advisement. There will be a period of time afterwards where if particular issues come up at the trial, each side will have a chance to provide some further briefing, but really there is going to be a dark quite period where we\u2019re not going to know anything more from the ITC until about early May. And in early May, we may find out that they rule in our favor which will kick off another round of possibilities for appeal by ClearCorrect and acceleration of the chain to the ITC that\u2019s the commission itself. But that\u2019s what immediately is in front of us concerning that matter.","Tom Prescott","John that covers the waterfront for you there.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","It does. Thanks very much.","Tom Prescott","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon.","Tom Prescott","Hi, Steve.","Ken Arola","Hi, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks for taking the questions everyone. Well, Ken, since you started the ball rolling down the 2013 path, I thought we should pickup the ball, because while you made a comment about case start growth and your confidence there. I think we can interpret your comment about the growth outlook for couple of different ways. I wonder I don\u2019t know if this is for Ken or for Tom, but given the comment that you think you get back to your normal growth trend. Just given what you\u2019re guiding for excluding that $4 million acceleration in the first quarter around Vivera. Is it just incredibly obvious statement to say you\u2019re guiding for pretty material acceleration over the balance of the year and is this another pretty strong double-digit year in the top line as you\u2019re thinking about it?","Tom Prescott","I think, Steve, I guess we\u2019ve said what we\u2019ve said along with the framework that Ken provided broad strokes, the Q1 guidance and more specific strokes. We felt that necessary to comment on our long-term financial model which both Ken and I did comment on in different ways. I think that stands for itself. We think this business can grow at that kind of level if this is a softer year for us in 2012 and we grew at 16% or so. I think most people would love the other problem. Ken, I\u2019ll let you pickup the rest of that question.","Ken Arola","Yes, I think again its dependent partly on the fact that want to make sure that patient flow is still there entirely in the office. So one of the things we made a comment on is, when we predicated on that that we see softness in the industry that that growth may not be that which we saw in the fourth quarter until we started exiting in here. So we\u2019re very confident. We have the right strategic levers that we\u2019re working on and have in place. We\u2019re going to be adding the sales force to drive additional growth in the business and upgrading our advertising campaigns again being on air mode to drive more patient interest. So we\u2019re doing a lot of things to push consumers into the doctor\u2019s offices this year as well as get after getting increased sales in Invisalign with a broader sales force and as long as patient flow is there, we think we\u2019ll continue to grow the business.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I will follow up, so. And Tom asked you, as you think about the way that the business trends over the course of the year. And we understand that around the end of 2012, it probably the real big issue that was pressuring patient starts was the macro uncertainty around the U.S., some of that might have been, let\u2019s say the fiscal-cliff, some of that might have been the election. What do you think are the two or three important levers that you\u2019re going to follow over the course of 2013 as you try to get a sense for what the patient flow looks like? Thanks so much guys.","Tom Prescott","Sure Steve. We\u2019ll leave the high-end macroeconomic forecasting to folks like you. That\u2019s hard enough to do. We try to see what\u2019s going on at a trend level and then try to understand how our customers are feeling in the office. And we know if we can keep our orthodontists customers in North America and Europe kind of an offense, with the right new products and interested and engaged and ensure they can get great results. And if we can keep and if the patient traffic is sufficient that GP offices that are more moderate users can feel comfortable to lead with the product like Invisalign then we know we can get more than our fair share. Those are the more secular trends we track closely, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I appreciate that very much. Ken, all the best to you. It\u2019s been great working with you.","Ken Arola","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Dolan with Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Dolan \u2013 Roth Capital Partners","Hey guys, good afternoon and Ken congrats on the tenure there.","Ken Arola","Thank you.","Matt Dolan \u2013 Roth Capital Partners","So I wanted to continue on your longer term commentary about shift over to the operating margin. You\u2019re guiding to 16% or 14% op margin in the first quarter, which is lower than what we\u2019ve seen in many recent quarters, (inaudible) growth dynamic that you might have touched in the previous question. Or is there some spend in the first quarter that isn\u2019t sustainable throughout year. Maybe just walk us through how that progression might take place.","Ken Arola","Sure, I guess I first make a comment on, if you think back to 2011 or 2012 even this year, we came in typically with the first quarter we have to step up and spending every year. So we start out the year usually in that kind of high teen range in operating margins and we\u2019ve been able to grow at each quarter as we move to the year this year and be able to exit the year at 23% operating margins for the year, kind of approaching that low-end of the range on an annual basis.","We are entering this year a little over base year as far as operating margin is concerned with the step up in spending that I was referring to. And that spending is going to be there for the year that might go up and down a little bit based on timing of activities and those types of things. We\u2019re really looking at driving top line revenue here and in getting the gross back into the top line with Invisalign sales getting leverage off of expanded sales force as well as lot of the chair-side apps like the Outcome Stimulator with the iTero scanner in driving more Invisalign volume.","So we\u2019re really focused on driving top line volume and maintaining on gross margins in that low to mid range of our long-term guidance and growing into the OpEx here.","Tom Prescott","Matt, if I can pile up for just a second. Nothing has changed in terms of our ability to kind of toggle spending, absolute spending up and down although in a given quarter it acts more fixed in general. We believe over the span of year with things improve, we can dial up things come and done a little bit, we can dial back as we proven in the past.","Some of the investments we\u2019re making around coverage and all that, we don\u2019t do those all the time and they\u2019re always a little lumpy when we lay a man. We\u2019re in the mode right now of bringing more reps online in North America and that started actually in Q4. So for us we\u2019ve gone through the cycle of analysis and believe that\u2019s both strategically and tactically a good choice and especially with our Q1 step typically step up in spending, it shows up a bit more. But again, just as we\u2019re pretty comfortable and in general we can live with our long-term model and the top line or even through the investments we\u2019ve been making. We\u2019re pretty comfortable as we at least exit the year; we can get back towards at least the low end of our long-term operating margin model as well.","Matt Dolan \u2013 Roth Capital Partners","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the second question is more on the utilization side, it flattened out in the fourth quarter if anything and I know you\u2019d spoken about the summer being a little slow for adults on the ortho side. So can you give us some specifics on what\u2019s given you confidence that the volume growth you\u2019re expecting to see which is low double-digits in Q1 and then it sounds like improving through the year, which one of those utilization variables are specifically driving that trend? Thank you.","Tom Prescott","I guess maybe the clearest read is into the ortho practice. And ortho practices are a bit busier than they were. It was, they had very quite late summer, early fall, literally September October some orthodontists remarking that it was the softest they\u2019d seen since the melt down of 2008. And they got to work and we got to work whether its \u2013 one customer asked me if it was tied to the election, because shortly after the election, traffic picked up in their office. And I\u2019ve seen, too hard to understand as I\u2019ve told the earlier caller, we don\u2019t \u2013 we read the macroeconomic forecasting, but we don\u2019t make it.","We really watch patient traffic doctor behavior closely and on the ortho side, they\u2019re engaged. They\u2019re more encouraged with Invisalign as a product and more comfortable they\u2019re getting better results with it. It\u2019s easier to use and that bodes well for whatever that\u2019ll be.","On the GP side, it is obviously more difficult to forecast. We have thousands of GP customers that do one or none cases on a given quarter and calling that as a forecast is probably our continuing biggest challenge, but with that said, we do multiple top down, bottom up, practice by practice forecast during each quarter and we\u2019re getting better visibility in what they\u2019re doing. If we have the traffic in the offices and we have our customers on offense we\u2019re going to get case starts.","Matt Dolan \u2013 Roth Capital Partners","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the questions. Yeah, I was just hoping you can guys help me reconcile a few items from a high level. Obviously it looks like you\u2019re calling for some very healthy case growth in 1Q and clearly ASPs were much better than what were looking for across the portfolio that is in 4Q. So I guess, just, what\u2019s driving if you could summarize for us, what\u2019s driving the lack of EPS growth in 1Q? Just trying to get better understanding of what\u2019s going on in the spending side and how we should be thinking about that throughout 2013?","Ken Arola","Yeah, this is Ken, Rob. I kind of refer you back to some of the comments that we just made on the call. So we have typically a step up in spending in Q1 sequentially related to compensation and benefit programs at the company here. That happens every year. This year, we\u2019ve also had the, in the first quarter we\u2019ve started recognizing expenses related to the medical device excise tax. And then we have the investments going on which we\u2019ve been talking about on the sales force expansion on the consumer platform etc.","So we\u2019re going to see spending step up from about $76 million, $77 million in quarter four to about $83-ish million in quarter one. And those are the items that are driving the spending. When we get the headcount on board, and like Tom said, it takes about several quarters to get a sales person really at this speed in their new territories. So we\u2019ll start getting leverage out of those sales people as we move through the year. And as well as being on air more, with our consumer programs, we did a nice uptick in traffic to our website. When we\u2019re on air, we see that pretty consistently and hopefully those turn into cases as well ultimately.","That\u2019s what driving the OpEx increase and like I said we think that\u2019s going to be relatively at that level if we take a little for the year. Given timing as a big events like AAO or ADA that occur in different quarters or maybe some of our own summits we put on for our doctors ourselves.","As far as gross margin, we think that\u2019s going to be pretty consistent. Here we\u2019ve got some little bit of headwind with some of the material cost coming in, but we think we can overcome that with the volumes in the business here. And from a manufacturing point of view, we actually should get less breakage on the line and better yield out of the line of material until it\u2019s a little bit softer.","So really gets back to top line growth and making sure we manage these expenses appropriately here. But we\u2019re investing for some strategic purposes and adding in those types of resources as we mentioned.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then just if I could dig in on the team line and the pace of uptick there. Does seem like in the quarter the year-over-year growth seemed little bit light even after factoring in the 4Q seasonality and you talked positively about the express line and the expectations there. Can you maybe guys just could you share with us how the trended team has been relative to your internal expectations and how are you thinking about that penetration as we move forward?","Tom Prescott","I guess I\u2019ll jump in here, Bob. The general direction for us on teen has been very, very successful. We continue to see progress quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and I think that if there is some market growth in the ortho segment, we get even more growth. If there is less or say even negative growth in ortho segment, we get \u2013 that\u2019s a bit of a moderating effect.","But if you look, for example at our webcast slides, you see that spike in Q3 it\u2019s a very consistent profile year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter with that same kind of pattern except to the amplitude it\u2019s greater. So the second thing that\u2019s going on inside that that gives us confidence that we continue this direction is the types of cases we\u2019re getting that are teen cases.","In the earliest days, three years ago, four years ago, we\u2019ve got just the simplest cases because mom and dad weren\u2019t willing to kind of say, well, I\u2019ll do Invisalign if it\u2019s good enough. They\u2019re going to get braces or Invisalign or whatever getting their teen straightened and they want perfect. So the more our doctors believe they can deliver perfect to the team, to mom and dad, the more they\u2019re going to use our product. And so with G3, G4, SmartTrack with that we can actually score the complexity of an incoming case, we actually look at the complexity of incoming cases on teens, and that is the hardest share for us to take from traditional bracket through wires and yet we see that we\u2019re getting harder and harder cases in.","So that pertains well for our continued progress. Again doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but our goal is very gene sees and do better and better and get more and more than our fair share. So, again, good steady progress, even though the total amplitude I think was down, because I think that\u2019s kind of a dampening effect to the broader economy.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I appreciate all the comments.","Tom Prescott","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, just two quick ones. I want to follow-up on the comments regarding gross margin in Q1. It kind of sounds like there are some type of inventory reserves that\u2019s going to be taken. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And then secondly, I wanted to also talk about the mix issue. If I look at sort of the Invisalign for this quarter, the case volumes grew only 4% which I think is a slowest quarter on record and it seems like the mix is clearly shifting towards the express categories and obviously teen grows, but teen also slowed as well. So I\u2019m kind of curious if I look at your guidance for 1Q, it kind of seems like you\u2019re guiding ASPs continuing to go down and I\u2019m wondering if that explained by the mix and is that see anything about the long-term trend or how we should be modeling margins over the longer term?","Tom Prescott","I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll divide and conquer here, Glen. I\u2019ll take the broader kind of market mix directional question and I\u2019ll ask Ken to come in and talk about the reserve on as we transition materials.","You pointed to two or different things at once and I\u2019ll see if I can then back them. First, we are trying to accelerate in a value-based area for Express 5, for i7, i14 in the UK and the few other countries in Europe and that\u2019s purposeful because we found small labs etc doing very simple cases and it was an opportunity for us to bring value at the basically the same price they were selling it for in far better results for our customers. So you should expect that to continue. The reason why it appeared to accelerate on a mixed basis had two drivers.","One was that we are trying to push greater usage of say, Express 5 in North America with a promotion which did get some trial and repeat usage. At the same time, the denominator got smaller because it was a softer overall quarter on full on adult and everything else. So if we were maybe to adjust for the softness you can see a little bit of mix shift, but it wouldn\u2019t be as pronounced as maybe shows up here again, more of a softer market dynamic.","The second thing is, that as we talked about it, a lot of volume came in late in the quarter that didn\u2019t necessarily we\u2019re commenting on it because it\u2019s important and it sets up the Q1 discussion. We generally don\u2019t comment in detail or quantitatively about receipts only to the extended points to our business flow and what I\u2019d say is that the business generally came back and as we look at Q1 there is a more normal balance, we would expect a more normal balance of adult starts and all that versus a very, very soft first half of Q4 meaning that mixed shift for express and those kinds of things were more pronounced.","I\u2019ll stop there for a second on the mixed story and let Ken pickup on the inventory reserve for SmartTrack.","Ken Arola","Yeah, hi Glen. First of all, with a big transition like this going from one material to another are at the significant move for the company here. And as we anticipated that we\u2019ve been planned for it, we wanted to make sure we had enough safety stock around of the current material that we have been using all to date. We plan to have 100% cut over to the new material when we turned it on, which is exactly what we did and we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re recovering ourselves to make sure we had enough of the older material or current material around. In case we had a glitch for some reason, at the end of the day, the good thing is that everything has gone very, very smoothly, the transition of new material has gone really from a manufacturing perspective.","So we knew we would have some inventory around. We weren\u2019t sure exactly how much depending on what happens, but essentially we\u2019re not going to use that old material. It has a shelf life of just a very short of period time about a quarter\u2019s three to time. So we\u2019ll actually be writing that inventory off as we go through the quarter here.","Tom Prescott","You should consider that to be success because that was safety stock, using that inventory reserve that the transition to SmartTrack didn\u2019t go well. Not using it signaling the reserve is going to get charged in Q1 says the transition has gone very well.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Jeremy Feffer \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Most of my things have been answered, just wanted to come back quickly on guidance for 1Q. You mentioned that currency was positive in 4Q, so can we expect or at least as implied in your guidance you don\u2019t really see any future FX headwinds in 1Q?","Tom Prescott","Well Jeremy I guess it depends where it goes, I mean we have our views of it. As we know today, its running a little bit higher in euro to the dollar than it was a month or two ago. So we take views of that into account as we develop our guidance but we\u2019ll have to see obviously that for the quarter.","Jeremy Feffer \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then just following up on that. So then the conclusion into draw from the expected revenue growth to be slower than the expected volume growth that\u2019s purely case of mix and also an improvement in utilization driving higher Advantage rebate usage? Is that correct or?","Tom Prescott","So what I would suggest you do as you look at the volume growth from Q4 to Q1, roughly 5% to 7.5% in our guidance. And if you look at the revenue growth and if you exclude the case refinement adjustments that we made in quarter four here and based on the revenue that would get you $137 million, $138 million adjusted and take that against the guidance we gave for revenue that tracks back to about 6% to 9% growth in revenue roughly.","Jeremy Feffer \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay.","Tom Prescott","And that includes the Vivera as well.","Jeremy Feffer \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Tom Prescott","Sure. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, how does the deferred revenue benefit in the fourth quarter breakdown between North America orthos and GPs and then versus international and then any color you can give us by product line would be helpful.","Ken Arola","Well it goes across pretty much all of our products based on the volume of products that we\u2019ve been shipping over the past several years here. We actually don\u2019t really disclose that on our product line basis. I can tell you from a geographic perspective the majority of the adjustment for case refinement is related to North America shipments given the volumes we\u2019ve had in North America over the past several years here compared to international. So does that help a little bit?","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah, yeah. And then could you give us an update on the Cadent facility transition, I believe that should be complete by now. And then do you still expect is this rational, but to assume $4 million of annualized savings at crew in \u201813 from that move?","Tom Prescott","So, we\u2019ve completed the transition actually last year at the end of the year here. And coming into this year, we have a pretty much all into the new facility down in whereas. As far as the $4 million statements goes, in cost of goods sold, because of the move, yes we have seen the savings there, but I will tell you we\u2019ve also had to deploy other resources against the business which offset that $4 million in savings in relations to the iTero issues we had several quarters that presses forward in technical support.","So technically we\u2019ve seen the savings with the move through facilities cost savings as well as overhead and labor costs, but again we\u2019ve deployed some of that against other activities in the company.","Ken Arola","We\u2019ve spent it back on other activities, some of it, none of it.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Brandon. Do you have another question?","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Just one more, quick one, is that all right?","Shirley Stacy","Yeah.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Any chance you could just quantify exactly how many Invisalign sales reps you ended \u201812 with? And then how many headcounts you expect to add in \u201813 and will these be focused on Invisalign or the scanner side of the business?","Tom Prescott","We\u2019re going to finalize that. I will take a look at that just before we file here I guess because we get a forecast from the each field as they\u2019re making offers and bringing people and we actually want to make sure they\u2019re on board. I\u2019ll tell you we probably had a dozen or already start with just as the year ended. So I don\u2019t know, Ken did you size it in more detail for North America?","Ken Arola","No, we did not.","Tom Prescott","So I think I\u2019ll pull up short of that but it\u2019s a meaningful addition and then obviously when we feather in the support team and the sales team in APAC as well as some incremental coverage in Europe it\u2019s a Europe significant expansion in our go-to-market site. So we wanted to talk about it in those terms and again I guess by the time file will rustle down absolute numbers in terms of you can see growth over last quarter.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","All righty, thank you.","Tom Prescott","Sure.","Shirley Stacy","Question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with Janney Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Spencer Nam \u2013 Janney Capital","Thanks for taking my questions and Ken we\u2019re going to miss you. Good luck to you going forward. Just quick question on the amortization of intangibles. What kind of impact you will have now that you guys not going to be taking out of the non-GAAP numbers? What\u2019s the estimated impact for 2013 on that?","Ken Arola","The amortization of intangibles is $1 million a quarter. We\u2019ve been consistently showing that between GAAP and non-GAAP this past year, but given the fact that those charges will continue for 10 to 13 years depending on the intangible, at least thought there was more appropriate to included in the non-GAAP at this point in time, so about $4 million a year.","Spencer Nam \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay, great helpful. And then on China, Tom, maybe you could comment on this. So you\u2019re going to start seeing some numbers from China. My understanding was that you guys had been really kind of building the pack of data if you will with samples and thought leaders. I\u2019m curious how those sort of overview work, what kind of results you guys have gotten. How confident you guys are that the experience that you guys have put together so far is going to effect the adoption here?","Tom Prescott","Couple of multipart question, I\u2019ll try and give a simple answer and that answer would be, our goal is then to take the top most respected orthodontists and dentists in China have them get actual experience with the product which is why, it was essential we had G3, G4 and these other innovations in their hands when they started. Have them complete lots of cases and then be able to, with us work on developing training for all their colleagues across China in the major cities and even second tier cities. And that\u2019s happening. We now have with some of the forums I talked about recently, we have these Chinese doctors showing finished cases for very, very complex year-and-a-half, 18 month, 24 month cases, extraction cases and very complex class II and class III even some surgical cases. ","And so with them showing their own results with the Invisalign product it is fairly dramatic statement. Again we\u2019re trying to build the right foundation and moving slowly and still have a pretty small business. I think we identified in our annual report last year it just how small it was in total, but I think it has the potential still to be very large and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going slowly and ensuring we have the support of the most respected clinical leaders in the country which is what we\u2019re about.","Spencer Nam \u2013 Janney Capital","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Spencer. Question please.","Operator","Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thank guys for fitting me in. maybe one long question and one short one. And the first one, I\u2019ll apologize in event of the bluntness, but you preannounce at the low end of your 4Q and you actually end up doing the high-end even exiting out the deferred. And when I look at your 1Q guidance guys and the commentary around GP is being flat, international being flat to down slightly. What it implies is about 20% sequential growth on case volumes in the ortho channel. If I go back over the past four years, you only to that metric one time and it was right after the launch of G3. So if you can talk your conviction or how comfortably you are with that 1Q guidance and I know there was a response in that Tom\u2019s question a little bit earlier, but what are you seeing in the ortho channel to give you such a high level conviction that you can see that type of sequential move in that particular channel? Thanks.","Tom Prescott","Sure, no apologize needed for a blunt question. As we commented in general about our standing guidance on December 5th with awake of a few executive departures, we felt it was important if we saw that softness to comment on us, no more no less. Literally the month of December turned on its head literally shortly after that call and we were very busy, very busy along with the offices remainder of the month. So again it goes back to forecasting, I don\u2019t know what that is, but we\u2019re happy to Ken, we\u2019re happy that tight came in a bit.","So what gives us confidence? We see pretty good visibility into all of our high volume practices, the intentions to build their practice, someone happiness on their part. They maybe didn\u2019t get to the level they expected in the Advantage program. Detailed plans in place to market their practice, build on Invisalign, a lot of excitement about SmartTrack and then we feather that in with think we can drive a little progress in GP and again a harder channel to move quickly.","And then what I will call normal internal where they take, in our eyes at least, extended holiday breaks and you\u2019re driven really by number of days worked. So with all that said, again, we\u2019re still being thoughtful about broader economic environment. We feel reasonably comfortable that we can continue to build on the volume we saw that jumped really and like the second week in December. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re calling it. No more, no less.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah. Very fair, I appreciate it. I guess it just seems a little less conservative over the past couple of years. On the second question, when I look at and I hate to burn the question on Cadent, but when I look at Cadent and I look at the sort of the service revenues not the scanner with the service, that\u2019s come down sequentially four quarters in a row. And so I guess the scanner sales are someone hanging in there especially considering Europe, but the services about using the machine once it\u2019s in there, the recurring revenue should grow with the growing installed base and we\u2019re seeing the exact opposite. So can you speak to, are these things being used, or are they being used effectively or why is that number coming down sequentially? Thank you.","Tom Prescott","I\u2019m deeply hurt that you\u2019re saying you burned the question on Cadent here, Jon. So we\u2019re glad you asked a question about Cadent. The fact is North America is working very well. We predicted internally that services would go down principally because we decided to get out of the bracket positioning business they had called IQ and there were several hundred high volume mostly ortho that use that service a lot. We just didn\u2019t feel we can scale it as we thought about the pieces of that business moving into what as, we would had to significantly reinvest in it. So we had a very thoughtful discussion with again hundreds of customers that really liked it and have a glide ramp down. They are turning off the usage of that product that\u2019s directly related to that service stream. If we then compare those side, if you looked at Invisalign case submission and the other things they\u2019re using in for both on GPs, you would see services growing very nicely, that isn\u2019t visible the level we disclosed at this point, but the principle issue driving that service volume or service revenue down is because of a concentrated base of customers with a product we\u2019re no longer supporting and that\u2019s started really in the summer time and I\u2019d say early Q3 that that trend you probably would not have seen as early as we did, but now that that\u2019s what showing up, so over time that\u2019ll get fixed.","The second part of that question is, we\u2019re kicking butt in North America in terms of placing scanners and customers are thrilled with them. The new scanners coming out, it is exciting, it\u2019s faster, its better, all the stuff. So we\u2019re actually winning in North America, notwithstanding gross margins which we have plans to fix very significantly.","In Europe, we\u2019re not trying because we don\u2019t have a better plan right now and I guess stepping back if you just see year-over-year flat, that really obscures the progress we\u2019ve made in North America and the progress that bring that and making sure the business is profitable in its own right. So with that, we\u2019re actually pretty excited about this business and its longer term prospects, but I\u2019ll grant you the visible part you\u2019ve got doesn\u2019t look as good as it should.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks guys.","Tom Prescott","Sure Jon.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Jon. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question please.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Jeffery Matthews with Ram Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Hi, great thanks. Can you hear me?","Tom Prescott","Yes, Jeff we can. How are you?","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Great, good how are you?","Tom Prescott","Okay.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","And Ken, good luck, congratulations.","Ken Arola","Great, thank you.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Two questions, one is, does the change in recognition of the deferred revenue. Does that have anything to do with better outcomes that the authors are seeing a change in the pattern of usage or is it simply outdated reserving methodology? And number two, you sound like you really have a lot of marketing pushes coming and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s seasonal or if that\u2019s a reflection of your new teen. Thanks.","Ken Arola","Okay. I\u2019ll take your first question on the case reserve planning and then Tom can comment on the marketing. Really what it is just looking at a more detailed analysis and more in-depth at the actual usage that we\u2019ve seen over the past several years of case refinement and looking at the estimates we were using in relation to accruing for that case refinement. In going back and updating is very simply we were estimating too high on the usage of case refinement.","With that said, I will say case refinement usage has been going up over the past several years, but we think also with the new technology in G3 and G4 and we haven\u2019t probably had enough experience in the field yet because if you think a doctor has to get the patient as to complete the case, might take year, year-and-a-half and they have up to six months of used case refinements beyond that. So as we get out to year or two I think you\u2019ll probably start seeing some benefit of that in relation to case refinements, we probably haven\u2019t seen any material way to date.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Got it. Thanks.","Tom Prescott","Great. Jeff, I\u2019ll take the other part of it. And maybe the first framework is, we aren\u2019t spending dramatically more money and I should not say dramatically at all in the sense it just we\u2019re spending incrementally more, we\u2019re doing better in a more integrated way. It was, for us, we felt it was a time for a good investment in a new consumer platform that\u2019s going to give us an opportunity to build on that both with traditional media, GP radio as well as a lot of other sites.","So in addition, we\u2019re working in a much more organized way now that we have what I\u2019ll call maturing channel coverage in at least five countries in Europe. And to a much smaller scale, won\u2019t be doing 30 or 60 seconds spots it\u2019ll be, what I will call, bump ads or whatever, little small elements, but its all about raising the awareness of Invisalign especially in markets where orthodontic treatment is not broadly used for among kids, adults, etc. So again reasonably small dollars in Europe, but what I\u2019d say kind of common dollars with the investments we\u2019ve made in building out the business and improving the product and making sure the distribution team is in place to take advantage of that demand creation. North America, all in we\u2019re going to spend a bit more but we\u2019re going to do it more effectively.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Okay. And you\u2019re obviously seeing a great potential for return on this.","Tom Prescott","We actually measure in many, many different ways and then we also survey our customers in one of the things they say consistently is, we are one of the best practice building partners in dentistry orthodontics and patients come and asking for Invisalign by name that has an outsize impact on, if we, the patients comes in and asks for Invisalign by name, and the doctor has confidence they can deliver the results they need, we\u2019ve got a very good shot at getting that case start and that\u2019s our game plan.","Jeff Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners","Got it.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","Q2 was driven by a better than expected revenue due to continued strong year-over-year Invisalign volume across our customer base and record utilization. With International case volume up 38.3% and North America up 15.3%. We also had a continued strong demand for our iTero Element with record shipments this quarter, resulting in revenue growth of almost 200% year-over-year.","For Q2 North America Clear Aligner volume was up 4% sequentially and 15% year-on-year on a sequential basis Q2 growth was driven by both our orthodontist and GP customers. Utilization among our orthodontist customers continued to increase and we reached record levels in both ortho and GP channels for a total of 10.7 cases per doc this quarter. On a year-over-year basis our Q2 volume growth rate continues to outpace our three year average driven by an increased ortho utilization, as well as expansion of our GP customer base.","Q2 Invisalign volume for International doctors is up 17% sequentially and 38% year-over-year, continued strength reflects record International utilization driven by EMEA, as well as continued expansion of our customer base in APAC. We are also seeing increased use of Invisalign G5 for deep bite in EMEA as well as in our Invisalign G6 for extraction cases in APAC, both showing momentum in the quarter and nearly equaling the overall growth rate for each respective region.","In EMEA Q2 volume was up 37% year-over-year led by Spain, France and the Netherland. Smaller country markets such as the Nordics and Eastern Europe also had strong year-over-year growth, although off a smaller base. Execution of our high touch TSM program is expanding our focused approach across all our markets in Europe and starting to deliver stronger growth. Our low state\u2019s Lite denies seven products and continue to contribute incremental growth. In Asia Pacific record shipments in Q2 resulted in 42% growth year-over-year, growth is very strong again in China, Japan, South Asia and Taiwan. Q2 was a busy quarter for customer events that is more than 700 doctors and clinical staff attending our second annual Invisalign APAC Summit in Macao.","In addition we had more than 500 orthodontists attend our country focused forum in China. We continue to ramp-up doctor\u2019s training in APAC with particular focus on developing doctors in newer markets such as India, Korea and Taiwan. In fact more than 100 doctors in Taiwan were trained in June alone. In important teen segment the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q2 increased 20% year-over-year reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenagers 11 and 19 years. We have definitely began to see an increase teen case starts in late Q2 as more teens go into treatment during the summer timeframe in North America.","Teen volume grew 19% year-over-year among our North America orthodontists. In addition we continue to make progress internationally among teenagers where we had 35% year-over-year growth. In Q2 in APAC for example we held a teen\u2019s forum for Australia and New Zealand markets where 200 doctors attended which was twice of what we expected. We also participated in a separate teen\u2019s forum sponsored by the SWAN University on a 12 months basis 155,000 teens started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign with an average age of 15 years old. Our investments in the teen segment continue as discussed at our Investor Day last month. We are currently developing products that will stay in Invisalign applicability over the next two or three years enabling our doctors to treat more teen patients and address younger kids for the first time.","Specifically we will preview a mandibular repositioning product for teen Class II corrections as well as our prototype parallel expansion used for Phase 1 treatment. With these additional offerings and features will give our doctors a complete set of clear and removeable appliances capable of any orthodontic treatment for patients of all ages.","Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA and APAC leveraged traditional paid media, search digital, marketing, TR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. Consumer interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. North America, a key focus area for Q2 was sharing the stories of real patients that have used Invisalign treatment to improve their smile. These patient stories have driven high consumer engagement with 136,000 video views.","New program launches included a partnership with Bravo TV on a network that reaches millions of woman who could benefit from Invisalign treatment. The Bravo integration via the Invisalign treatment into the story line of the hit show Odd Mom Out. In EMEA, we focused primarily on the real patient campaigning which continues to drive interest from Invisalign treatment online with Web visits growing 112% compared to the same period last year. In Asia Pacific, new consumer campaigns kicked off in China and Australia, New Zealand and programs continued in Hong Kong and Japan to drive consumer awareness and patient demand. In Q2, we are planning a big bang consumer campaign in China, which will leverage [Paris fashion week].","In Q2, our scanners business revenues were up 36% sequentially and up nearly 200% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter. Demand of the iTero Elements scanner continues to expand fueled by primarily by North American customers. This past March we began shipping iTero Element to restore their workflows to customers who had pre-ordered and were awaiting the new iTero Element. In EMEA we received a record number of iTero contracts. And in APAC we received strong orders upon launching iTero Element at our Invisalign APAC Summit in May. We continue to work through the backlog of iTero Element Scanners, which remain at roughly six months lead time, as demand for our industry leading Intraoral scanners continue. Use of iTero Scanners for Invisalign cased emissions in place of [TDS] impressions continue to expand.","For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with the digital scanner worldwide increased 37.4%, which reflects a record 46.4% from North America and 20.5% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our iTero Scanner, we are also seeing some uptake from 3M\u2019s True Def and Sirona's Omnicam, the other two third parties of digital scanners that are qualified for Invisalign case submission.","Before I turn the call over to David for our financial review, I want to talk to you about a supplier agreement we announced today with SmileDirectClub for their doctor directed at home Aligner program for minor tooth movement. It feels that orthodontics and dentistry has changed tremendously in a few decades since Align Technology was founded. Many of the greatest changes we have been and continue to be driven mass customized Clear Aligners, 3D treatment planning and restorations, digital photography, XRAYS, scanning, laser therapy, practice management, software, mobile devices and this can go on-and-on.","Technology has changed the demands of potential patients as well. The Internet, ecommerce and social media, if consumers access the more information and more options for every type of treatment and procedure including where and when they want it and that cost much lower than traditional options. We have been watching the intersection of these technology advances and changes in consumer behavior and particularly we have tracked the different approaches to at home teeth straightening with Clear Aligners. I am talking specifically about doctor directed treatment, shipped directly to consumers. Not consumers trying to treat themselves in a do it yourself fashion.","The at-home model follows an established trend of direct to consumer ship to home option for eye glasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and more. Logically this type of at-home treatment in orthodontics is only possible with Clear Aligner. And as the leader in Clear Aligner technology we believe Align has to participate in and help shape this evolving market. The emerging leader in this market is now SmileDirectClub. It\u2019s a privately owned business based in Nashville, Tennessee, they were found in 2013 and are doing business in 49 out of 50 states so far. Potential patients can either visit a smile shop to get scanned, schedule an in-home scanning appointment or send them photos and impressions online to begin the evaluation process.","SmileDirectClub offers a device first class Medi many treatments that includes up to 20 stages with no attachments and no iTR in their proximal reduction. Primarily full adults it is permanent injunctions they have a network remote licensed orthodontists and general practitioner dentist to evaluate review and approve the patient treatment and monitor progress of the case throughout treatment. In a separate release today we announced the supplier agreement with SmileDirectClub specifically Align will provide a digital case set up which is made available on SmileDirectClub smile check portal. A SmileDirectClub licensed orthodontist or a general dentist will review and approve the treatment and Align will then manufacture aligners and ship them directly to SmileDirectClub.","These aligners will be manufactured per SmileDirectClub specifications which does not include attachments and iTR. To be clear this is not Invisalign, Invisalign brand and system of Clear Aligners will not be used for this kind of direct to consumer market. The Invisalign system requires in office doctor involvement throughout the course of treatment, while only be made available from an Invisalign provider. At Align we are investing nearly $100 million in R&D and marketing to further advance the science and technology for Invisalign brand. The most advanced Clear Aligners in the world. So our doctors could continue to achieve great outcomes for their patients.","We will continue to path the innovation we have delivered over the last 20 years as per advance of science and technology through our Invisalign doctors with new products such as class III, teen class II morph and Phase 1 pilot expander that we indicated again recently in 20-F, that will be available in 2017. These types of Invisalign advancement will significantly increase the applicability of Invisalign Clear Aligners to our in office doctors. With the goal of our agreement with SmileDirectClub is to help expand the market and opportunity for Invisalign doctors while supporting SmileDirectClub\u2019s protocol as described.","Which means we expect there to be little cannibalization of existing markets. In addition we are creating a new Invisalign doctor referral program similar to our Invisalign doc locater that will ensure that the 30% of SmileDirectClub potential patients that do not fit these protocols and who are interested in strengthening their teeth will be channeled back to existing Invisalign and office docs. The process will work like this, beginning in October we will create a new Invisalign doctor referral program much our like doc locator works today, consumers will request the smile check case assessment from SmileDirectClub, but whose case is outside of their treatment scope will be systematically referred to an Invisalign provider in the area. We believe this will provide incremental growth opportunities for Invisalign doctors by connecting them with new potential patients that would not have sought otherwise.","The at-home direct to consumer market is growing rapidly and while still very small today we believe the incremental growth potential that this huge market represents is compelling, providing consumers who had very simple mild inclusions with access to more affordable treatment from the convenience of their own home is accelerating and will only expand the overall market for orthodontic treatment.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David White","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $269.4 million, up 12.8% from the prior quarter, and up 28.6% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. Second quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $243.4 million was up 10.8% sequentially, and up 21.2% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes and to a lesser extent our price increase in North America. On a year-over-year comparative basis, the growth rate for both total revenue and Clear Aligner revenue was lower by approximately four points, related to the Additional Aligner policy change we implemented in July last year.","Q2 ASPs were up sequentially from Q1, about $30, reflecting a price increase in the U.S. as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, as well as our price increase in North America and International. These increases were partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to the Additional Aligner policy change made last year.","For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 177,000 cases were up 8.1% sequentially, reflecting growth from both our international and North America customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 22.4%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontist, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 4.7% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 20% year-over-year.","For North American GP dentist, case volume was up 3% sequentially and up roughly 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued solid performance from mid high volume GPs offset somewhat by our large base of oral volume GPs. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 16.8% sequentially and up 38.3% year-over-year, reflecting increased adaptors and utilization.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q2 was 5.1 cases per doctor, up from 4.6 in Q2 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 10.7, up from 9.5 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.1, up from 3.0 in the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0 also a record, up from 4.6 cases per doctor in Q2 last year, driven primarily by increased utilization in EMEA, which was a record 5.5 cases per doctor in Q2 compared to 4.8 cases a year ago. In Q2, we added 2,885 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,125 of which were new North American doctors, and 1,760 of which were new international doctors. This compares to 2,470 in Q1 and 2,455 in the same quarter last year.","Our Scanner & Services revenues for the second quarter were $26 million, up 36.3% sequentially and up almost 200% year-over-year. As Joe mentioned we began shipping the iTero Element for restore the workflow in Q2 and as a result almost half of the scanners shipped were for our GP customers who have been patiently waiting for their new iTero Element. We are pleased that demand for scanners continues to be strong as we continue keeping pace with shipments.","Moving on to gross margin, second quarter overall gross margin was 76.2%, slightly better-than-expected, up 0.5 points sequentially and year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.6%, up 0.3 points both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher ASPs partially offset by seasonally higher training activity. The year-over-year gross margin increase primarily reflects the benefit from leverage of our fixed cost over higher case volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs as a result of the additional Aligner policy. Q2 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 53.6%, up 8.6 points sequentially and 38.6 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases in gross margin were primarily a result of higher ASPs and the lower manufacturing cost of our iTero Element scanner.","Q2 operating expenses were $140.1 million, up sequentially by $12.8 million or 10%, primarily due to a full quarter of employee compensation related cost such as annual wage increases, stock based compensation awards and new hires as well as go to market investments. Q2 operating expenses were lower however than our outlook due primarily to slower hiring and investments in sales territory coverage, same go-to-market activities that were delayed on the second half of the year and more ERP cost being capitalized and anticipated during the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $23.8 million or 20.4% reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of our business as well as our ERP implementation project.","Our second quarter operating margin was 24.2% up 1.9 points sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to higher Clear Aligner volumes and higher gross margins overall. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating margin was impacted by 2.3 points from the Additional Aligner policy change.","With regards to our second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 23.2% compared to 23.4% in Q1 2016. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.62 compared to $0.50 reported in Q1 and $0.39 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, capital expenditures for the first quarter were $18.8 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Juarez, Mexico, and our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $76.2 million and free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $57.3 million.","During the quarter, as a part of our $300 million April 2014 stock repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, to purchase $50 million of our common stock. Under which we paid $50 million and received the initial delivery of approximately 0.5 million shares based on current market prices. The final delivery of shares is scheduled for October and the number of shares will be based on our volume weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR less on agreed upon discount. Upon completion of the ASR, we will commence the repurchase of $50 million of our common stock on the open market. These two options together will complete our April 2014 stock re-purchase program.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, included both short and long-term investments were $685 million, this compared to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $6.3 million. Lastly I wanted to comment on our ERP implementation, which went live the first week of July. Over the past year plus our team has worked very hard to ensure successful data migration and integration of new systems and processes. Overall our implementation went very smoothly. Given the magnitude of this process, and project we are continuing to monitor and trouble shoot potential issues but at this time believe we are past any potential for significant business disruption.","We are pleased to have a foundation that enables new capabilities, improves our speed of execution and will be used to improve our customers\u2019 experience. As part of this implementation, we also implemented a legal restructuring of our subsidiary relationships, which will return in access of $100 million of cash to the U.S. tax free in Q3. As Joe mentioned earlier, in October we will begin supplying aligners to SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligner program for minor tooth movements. As part of this transaction Align acquired a 17% stake in SmileDirectClub for $46.7 million and gained a seat on SmileDirectClub\u2019s Board of Directors. As a result of our equity holding in SmileDirectClub Align is required to account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Thus Align will include a proportional share of SmileDirectClub\u2019s earnings or losses in its financial statements beginning July 25, 2016.","Our financial results will reflect two components, commencing in October when we begin to supply aligners the sale of aligners to SmileDirectClub and the income there from under the supply agreement which will be reported in our Clear Aligner business segment. And in Q3 and going forward our portion of SmileDirectClub\u2019s reported profits and\/or losses will be included in our operating expenses. We are excited about this incremental new market opportunity and the potential our Invisalign doctors to benefit from an untapped segment of consumers with minor malocclusion who want a better smile. We anticipate this relationship would be incremental to our top-line revenue and earnings in 2017.","With that let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook, as we head into the summer months and busy teen season we expect to an increase of teen case starts, among our North America Orthos. Our North American GPs typically have a seasonally slower quarter in Q3. Overall we are expecting North America volumes to be seasonally down quarter-over-quarter.","In our International markets our European doctors typically spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. Our Asia Pacific region continues to grow and is beginning to offset some of the seasonality we typically experience in our European countries. We therefore anticipate international Invisalign patients to be flat to sequentially up from Q2.","For our scanner business we expect scanner shipments to be up sequentially as the iTero Element continues to penetrate the market. We estimate the Q3 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction will reduce diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows, Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 174,200 to 176,900 cases, up approximately 18.1% to 19.9% over the same period a year ago.","We expect Q3 net revenues to be in the range of $267.2 million to $273.5 million. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74.4% to 74.8%, down sequentially, primarily due to increased mix of scanner business and continuous investment in international manufacturing expansion. We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $147.1 million to $148.1 million, up quarter-over-quarter primarily due to hiring. The late marketing investments as previously mentioned and higher ERP expenses as the cost of the last implementation phase called stabilization are not capitalized. Our Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 19.3% to 20.6%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24.5% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.52.","With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks, David. Exciting time for Align Technology demand and adoption of our Invisalign system continues to expand across all of our regions and with each new Invisalign innovation, doctors are doing more and more with Clear Aligners and growing their practices. Today we announced a supply agreement with SmileDirectClub, who will provide access to Clear Aligner treatment to more consumers than before while providing Align with an incremental revenue opportunity and helping us to connect Invisalign providers with a new base of potential patients.","Thanks for your time today. I'll now open the call for your questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Most of the metrics in the quarter were ahead of your own guidance and then ahead of our expectations. I guess one exception relative to us at least was North American cases and in particular case growth with GPs so I guess I was just curious how does the 10% growth case in North American GP is compared with your own internal expectations, and then just related to that any view of what you can do or what you are doing that could reaccelerate growth in that group in the back half?","David White","Yes, Bob, David. So, if you look at our business in North America and you compare that growth relative to the last few years. If we feel like our North America business has really taken a nice uptick this year and starting last year with many of the investments we made, we think it's still strong on both the ortho and the GP side where we're continuing to see at record or near record utilization amongst those classes of doctors. We still are challenged when it comes to low stage doctors particularly the most emitting GPs who engage with us one quarter and then maybe don\u2019t engage in the next quarter, and so we struggle at times trying to reach those doctors and we continue to invest in various to go market strategies that will build engage them more fully with us but it does represent a challenge for us in terms of how we forecast those doctors in any particular quarter. The other thing I would just mention is that when you look at our comps particularly in second quarter year-over-year you will remember that Q2 a year ago we had, we were running an E5 and E10 promotion at that point in time, which we\u2019re not running this year.","And so when you look at last year, Q2, we had a very strong quarter from a case launch standpoint because of those promotions on those low stage products, as well as the fact that we had additional aligner program that was -- you might say an easier qualification mark for the doctors to qualify for. And when you look at those two, they have a bigger impact on our year-over-year volume, but certainly a lesser impact on a year-over-year revenue basis.","Robert Jones","Okay, that will make sense. And I guess just one on the SmileDirectClub agreement. And it sounds like you are saying it could be incremental to the P&L and in particular top-line next year. Anyway we could put a little bit more numbers around that, maybe how many members that they have today, how many do you anticipate will show up at Invisalign dentist offices, anything just directionally to help us as we think about layering that in, would be really helpful?","Joe Hogan","Hi Bob, it's Joe Hogan. You can tell by the announcement that that will start in October, we\u2019ll start shipping then. It\u2019s hard for us to really triangulate around what that might mean as we go into next year. But we\u2019ll give you as much transparency as possible when we come back for the third quarter earnings announcement.","Robert Jones","Fair enough, thanks so much.","Joe Hogan","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby","Same line of questioning, I guess. Can you give us any sense of how much you think the SmileClub deal expands your total addressable market here? This looks previously untapped. Do you have a size of the overall opportunity?","Joe Hogan","Yes it's really hard for us to call the market. I mean when you look at the run rate right now of SmileDirectClub it's in the $50 million range. It has really been accelerating significantly over the last six months. So it's really difficult to quantify this market. You can also see by the statistics that we threw out, Rob did -- this is the market that we really haven't serviced. It's less than 2% overlap with our current business. It's something we\u2019re learning a lot from Doug and David, the two key leaders in the business who know exactly how this works. So we\u2019re excited about it. We think we can help. We\u2019ll make a good partnership. We\u2019re also excited about how we feel it can help our business too in the sense of referrals back, they\u2019re going through this protocol back to our Invisalign in-doc office business, so.","David White","But again this is brand new. It's hard for us to call it. And we\u2019ll give you more data as it becomes more apparent and as we move into the supply agreements in October.","Robert Willoughby","Maybe another factorial question around it though. If they\u2019re kind of tracking along at a $50 million rate, I assume they\u2019re losing a little bit of money on that. Is that a safe bet?","David White","Yes right now, I think they\u2019ll be cash flow positive next year sometime. So, this year they\u2019ll still burn again.","Robert Willoughby","And just how worse -- is there a liability if the treatment goes bad, that goes back to an orthodontist somewhere, correct? That does not come to you. And just the last one on SmileClub is there a bad debt number associated with the business?","David White","I\u2019ll take the later part. As it relates to the bad debt part, they have a very small cancellation rate amongst the people that are qualified. So, they go through a process where person identifies himself in having an interest in being treated. They are screened in multiple levels from both a photographer -- both from a photo standpoint as well as from a scan or an impression. And assuming the person passes their protocols and is capable of being treated, they have a very small cancellation at that point in time.","Joe Hogan","And Rob on the question as you had about, from a liability standpoint. Remember we\u2019re the supplier of these aligners. We are -- FCC will sell them to the customer base. We do as per their specifications. Our job is to make the cleanest best aligners we can based on those specifications. FCC obviously makes the transfer, and something like that. We have liability. And we think we\u2019re all doing a lot too there we have the deepest pockets they are going to have some issues too, but I think from a liability standpoint, I think it's shared in that sense that I'll ask Roger to make a comment on this.","Roger George","Hi, it is Roger George, General Counsel. The doctor is writing the prescription and then treating the patient, so that is where they start. That's our common model.","Operator","The next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sachin Kulkarni","Hi, it is Sachin in for Brandon. David if we look back four years ago, 3Q12 was on the very few periods historically that Aligner has come short of its revenue guidance. And at that time, you pointed to noise around Olympics as well as the pullback in advertising activity because of the event, so I am curious did you apply an extra dose of conservatism or not with respect to your initial 3Q guidance with upcoming Olympic and for which extent did you consider that factor if at all?","David White","Well, I wasn\u2019t here four years ago, but I think that\u2019s an interesting cause well I haven\u2019t heard that one before since I have been here. I can tell you as it relates to our Q3 guidance that we have given today that didn\u2019t enter into our thinking at all. And we basically approach our guidance the way we typically approach it, looking at the strength of the prior quarter, the doctor engagements, et cetera. And that particular factor wasn\u2019t considered.","Sachin Kulkarni","And also could you walk us through impact of the anniversarying of the aligner policy change in the second half on both the revenues and the P&L?","David White","So, it continues to be a drag on earnings and it will be drag on earnings for as we said a year ago, for at least a couple of years as we work off those grandfathered cases. But starting in Q3, however, it won't be a drag on a year-over-year compare because Q3 2015 was the first quarter in which we actually implemented that policy. So, I think those -- we won't talk about it necessarily so much on a year-over-year basis, but it still will be a drag to some extent.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve Beuchaw","Just a two couple of little household housekeeping items, the ERP, I mean once we get to fourth quarter, can you give us a sense for what the swing is on OpEx between say 3Q and 4Q just for underlying purposes once we get past that ramp?","David White","Yes. So, Steve, it\u2019s going to be a little bit up in Q2, about a little bit less than a couple of million dollars, primarily as I indicated in my comments that, the stabilization phase is not capitalizable. So, that\u2019s an uptick in Q3 and when we get to Q4, we would expect that principally to reverse itself almost dollar for dollar as those costs begin to drop off.","Steve Beuchaw","And then just one Joe sort of reflecting back on your prepared remarks, probably the most positive I have heard you in your tone around third-party scanners and their contribution, I wonder if you could just expand upon that, I mean what is it you're saying there that is incremental here and could you give us a sense for where you think volumes are headed there? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Steve, I think my enthusiasm is around just the scanners in general when you see the percent of scanner are getting right now, they come into organization approaching 50%. I mean it is a lot to us from a quality standpoint and how we can build our customer base, so I think I interpreted my enthusiasm more around just the scanning piece than it is third-party or whatever. Our scanning business obviously is having a really good year and we are expecting it to have a very strong this year too, and it's not just selling scanners, it's just what it does it reinforces from a customer base standpoint, both through GPs and Orthos, and just makes things easier for us. And it gives a wonderful platform in the sense to use that scanner for additional products, making things easier for our customer base. As far as the third party piece, as shown in 3M or whatever, we're just seeing continued growth of those. There is nothing I would say that that's entotic about it. But it's just good strong linear growth going forward. And so that's helpful also.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","I might have a two or three. And numbers look really good. So I'm actually going to focus on the FCC deal that you announced. The first one Joe, I'm still a little confused. You mentioned 1% or 2% cannibalized. But when I look at your cases and sort of lean on the Analyst Day, spread seems to be 15% plus. So can you sort of walk us through numbers, or rectify them. Why Express 15 plus, you are cannibalizing one and two. Is that just because of the lack of attachments in the ITR?","Joe Hogan","Hi Jon it is Joe. When you look at there is different protocols on this and so it's not just a number of aligners. It's what\u2019s done. So just from an overall standpoint, remember there is no ITR as it's been on these, there is no attachments and obviously on E5 you wouldn\u2019t have attachments, but E10 you do sometimes. Secondly is, it's not directly it doesn\u2019t move lower. They are basically moving so-so swiftly, and they\u2019re moving with different velocity and different rates. And when you add that all up, it really comes after to as a very small overlap on that piece. Now your question has to do with our Express line. I think those overlaps are like 4% on E10, 8% on E5. When you are running against our whole portfolio, that's where you get less than 2% to the whole thing. So, we have a track pretty well. We know this well. That's why we're confident about the minimum amount of cannibalization we would expect as we go into market.","Jon Block","Okay. And maybe, can you give any details on what you are going to ship aligners to FCC in terms of the cost that they don\u2019t pay on the revenue that you will recognize on those aligners?","Joe Hogan","So we have not disclosed, Jon, the pricing of those aligners. What we have disclosed is that the pricing is dependent upon volume discounts. And as their business ramps, they will earn lower pricing. But when you look at it on an incremental basis, we priced it basically on a pro-liner basis. We believe it's going to be accretive to the Company, both from a revenue standpoint as well as from an operating margin standpoint.","Jon Block","So, I get that, and accretive to you guys. But is it going to be dilutive to your customers, and that\u2019s maybe my final question, and then I have got more and I'll take them offline. But that's what I'm having a really hard time here with is. Joe you came in and you did such a great job, sort of walking off to the customers, shaking hands and eliminating the main point of friction with the additional aligner policy. And it seems like to me, is this a risk that you just sort of bring back in a main point of friction, because you are going to have a subset of docs who believe they are Express business in some other cases are now being pointed to that whole business? Thank you, guys.","Joe Hogan","Jon, it's a fair question. And obviously it was something we strategically had to wrestle with inside the Company as we work with SmileDirectClub. But I think you can see that as we work through this, when you looked at, we keep the Invisalign product within SmartTrack, SmartStage, all the pieces of that, Invisalign brand name, all that stages at doctor's office. And also see this is EX30 it is basic dental materials that\u2019s been out there for years. ","There is no ginger of a cut straight rail system it's going to a group where we feel demographics that are a lot more concerned with convenience and cost. And then when we ran those protocols that we just talked about and showed the less than 2% would be an issue for us from a cannibalization standpoint. And I make stat Jon honestly with when you look at what's going to on overall in the market place right now with direct to consumer, you just saw the thing with Dollar Shave Club and what Unilever had to pay for that company, because they were late to that game. ","I really felt that for a lot of reasons both from an offensive standpoint and a new market standpoint, that this would be balanced well with concerns from a customer base. And we will do our best to ensure our customer base if this isn\u2019t intended that way. And we'll work as best to see to continue to target the demographic that they have been targeting and being successful with.","Jon Block","Alright. Thanks for your time guys.","Joe Hogan","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Kreger","Hi thanks very much, I had a CapEx question. I think at Analyst Day you talked about over the next few years moving both planning and our fabrication to Europe and Asia, can you just remind us the timing of that and if we should assume any sort of a step up in CapEx to do it and when you layer the volume of SmileDirect on, will that prompt any sort of retrofitting anywhere else?","Joe Hogan","So John, we have actually begun some of the activities incidental to expanding our pace of international operating activities. So as an example, we established in Europe a base where doctors who are submitting physical impressions, can send them to a European address to have them scanned. Those are sending them all the way to Juarez. So we have implemented that. And so you've seen, there has been some CapEx associated with that and there has been some operating expenses for starting that activity up. ","We have also begun looking at establishing some treat capacity in some of our regions and begun piloting some of that with small numbers of people and experimenting with how those work flows might work. As it relates to a bigger piece which would be doing Aligner Fabrication, that is still further add to the future, 2017 plus. And so, we will begin to see some of that now. And when you look at our gross margins actually for guidance in Q3, there is a little of an impact from that.","As far as CapEx standpoint is concerned, STC won't really impact that very significantly. Their volume is relative to our, volumes are still very modest. And we wouldn\u2019t expect the uptick to be meaningful. As it relates to the rest of our business, probably for the next two years or so, I think as that infrastructure begins getting placed geographically, we would probably see a little bit higher CapEx than what we normally experience. And that at which point as those operating are established and the brick and mortars up, we would probably expect CapEx return to kind of a nominal rate we saw historically.","John Kreger","Great thanks and just one more, Joe, stepping back if you think about your opportunity with that Clear Aligners, the bigger opportunity which seem to be teens, but that tends to have a little bit lower volume growth for you, what do you think you need to do to get teen growth equal to or outpacing your adult case lines?","Joe Hogan","Yes I think, at our Investors Meeting recently in New York, I think we laid that out pretty well. When you look at first of all from an R&D standpoint. China moved from a chronological standpoint backward to the pilot expansion and main digital expansion kind of devices that we announced that we'll have in the marketplace in 2017 is one part of that.","Secondly is a sense of how we go to consumers and how we communicate Invisalign capability to the consumer base. Honestly, a lot of our approach to that marketplace over the years has been primarily through our results and that\u2019s all demographic. And we feel pretty strongly as we move into next year, we\u2019re going to have to - really there is two sides this equation. As you look at the three people involved normally in teens, you have a father, you have a mother, and then you\u2019re going to have the teen and then you also have a doctor. We found that overtime you get to win two out of three. And I think often we win the one with teen we lose the mom, or we lose the doc.","And so we\u2019re working on both ends hard from an advertising standpoint to make sure we do better in working with our docs in the sense of our teen capability and expanding it coming forward. And then secondly is to get to the mom in a much better way, particularly around compliance, a lot of mothers or fathers have concerns of their teens really were aware of the amount of time that\u2019s needed to properly move the teen. We found out through over the years that actually teens are more compliant than adults. And so we\u2019re very confident.","And frankly the dentition and teen are really helpful in the sense of how loose the dentition is and how fast we can actually move teen teeth. So, as we speak, we\u2019re working hard in a sense of how we\u2019re going to approach teens next year. It\u2019s a great question, because it is obviously 75% of the marketplace, and it\u2019s one that we have not obviously penetrated thoroughly. And I think we can make some really good progress in the next year.","David White","Hi John just to add a little bit color to Joe\u2019s comments there. If you look at our teen growth, our teen growth is still north of 20% year-over-year, which we think is really outstanding in a market that\u2019s only growing 3% to 4%. You know that share that we\u2019re taking away from large in brackets. And I think when you look at the 20% it made a lag our overall growth as a company by maybe a point or two. But I think some of that is largely attributable to the fact that our international business is growing faster than what we\u2019re growing here in North America. ","And their business is more dominated by treatment of adults. So as our international business has been growing at those faster rates, it had somewhat of a dilutive impact on our overall teen growth, because our teen is more dominated here in the U.S. So we still feel like that the teen business is growing great and still feel like we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities still headed of us there.","John Kreger","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the CDC, I\u2019m curious if you could characterize for us the type of customer or consumer that just the lead generation aspect to the type of customer or consumer that\u2019s going to SmileDirect and how will that compares to who is learning or coming to Fair Aligners through your Web site. Did you do any research, or do you have any information there about kind of the types, who were just getting this type of products versus traditionally who goes through the doc locater and traditionally on your align channel?","Joe Hogan","You know I could day that we don\u2019t have exhaustive data on that. I mean what SmileDirectClub has shared with us. the demographic end tend to be heavily weighted toward women versus men, which we see in our demographics too. But these are people that are really often millennials. The convenience is really important to them. If they have a certain want, from a freedom standpoint as such that visiting doctors' offices, there is obviously a price point here too that's something simple in the sense of what they want to move from inclusion standpoint. So it's not necessarily a gender difference from what we've done or an age difference, but it's a preference difference in the sense of how people want to engage from what we can see so far.","Richard Newitter","Okay and then maybe just turning one financial one, on gross margin, I think you said that you have some manufacturing start up cost for you APAC kind of initiatives there bringing manufacturing closer to that part of the world, that's going to impact the step down in gross margin in third quarter. Can you just give us a sense as to whether or not that is kind of finite nature or should we kind of think of that as kind of a go forward kind of gross margin rate for future quarters modeling or how should we think about that? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Yes, I would say it's probably more of a go forward rate, but let me give you a little bit more color to that, because I was answering that question in the context of a CapEx discussion. When you actually look at the biggest impact on gross margins and the fact that they are declining just slightly quarter-over-quarter, the biggest impact is from our scanner business, which has a gross margin that is in the low 50s. And as that business is growing more than doubling on year-over-year basis, it's having a little bit more of a dilutive impact on overall gross margins. But I would say that the guidance we've given for Q3 is probably the best guidance we could give you on a more going forward basis as well.","Richard Newitter","Okay, thanks. And if I could squeeze one more in. I believe you said you had the G6 product launching in the U.S., so you had anticipated that, I was just wondering any initial feedback there and how that launch is going assuming it's already happened?","Joe Hogan","We've launched G6 in the U.S. G6 functions well. I mean we have good feedback on it, but honestly when you look at the demographics again of this, it moves to Asian, because extraction cases in Asia are way over board in a sense of number of cases they see. So It's being used in North America, it's been successful, it's growing in that sense, but predominantly it's been an APAC product.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Rich. Operator, we will take one last question, please.","Operator","Okay, the last question today comes from Chris Lewis of ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.","Christopher Lewis","Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in. ","Shirley Stacy","Hi Chris.","Christopher Lewis","I guess first just on North American price increase, can you quantify what the increase was on the timing of that and the rest of just what you've seen since you have implemented that pricing strategy?","Joe Hogan","Yes, the price increase was effective April 1, so we saw just a partial impact of that in the second quarter. The magnitude of the price increase vary depending upon the products that are primarily applied to our full stage products and varied anywhere from $50 to I think $70 to $80.","Christopher Lewis","Okay got it, so it's reasonable to assume that at least in North America ASP trend up in the third quarter from second quarter?","Joe Hogan","From a revenue standpoint, yes. There are other factors however though when you go into the third quarter, because typically we have more promotion activity going on in the third quarter particularly for teens, but holding that aside, you are right.","Christopher Lewis","Understood, and then just turning to actuarial element, understands it's going to increase sequentially. Are you still working through the backlog there and if so when do you think that will be kind of more on a normalized basis. I guess I'm looking beyond the third quarter and just kind of trying to gauge where sales go post to 3Q? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","So, I think one of the things we've been very fortunate where this that, demand that we saw and post the announcement of the product in March of 2015 has continued to almost outpace our ability to deliver. And so we\u2019ve had a very good first half of the year with orders maintain that backlog in spite of our increased efforts to get ahead of it. We would expect that more nominal way to backlog would probably be somewhere in the half the levels that we have today. And we think that would be somewhere maybe towards the end of the year by the time we would catch up.","Christopher Lewis","Okay great and then just one more from me, as we think of that full list of new scanners being placed, it sounds like mostly in the GP channel. When do you think that will really start to translate into utilization? And do you think - is there an immediate pick up, uptick in utilization, once the GP receives that scanner or is a bit of a lag effect there? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","We still wrestle with that question. Honestly, Chris I think obviously there is an immediate pick up if they are a user today, from an Invisalign standpoint, they turn all the impressions over to iTero, and you see it immediately. But as far as, they actually keep doing more and more cases, we have more and more data say that\u2019s true. We can't quantify exactly right now, exactly how true that is and to what degree it occurs.","Christopher Lewis","Okay, thanks for the time.","Shirley Stacy","Thank you everyone - sorry operator. I\u2019ll go ahead and close. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and oral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the first quarter and how we see 2018 unfolding. Following that, I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and then open up the call to questions.","Overall, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to another outstanding year for Align with better than expected revenues, volumes and operating income. Record Q4 revenues were up 43.7% year-over-year, driven by increased Invisalign volumes across all geographies and customer channels as well as by record iTero scanner revenue. Q4 Invisalign volume was up 34.2% year-over-year, reflecting strong international growth from increased utilization and expansion of our customer base, which included over 4000 new customers for the third consecutive quarter. Notwithstanding the strong performance, our Q4 results were impacted by the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which reduced our reported net income and EPS. However, Q4 operating income was a record $109.6 million or 26%. John will discuss this in more detail in his section in a few minutes.","For the full year, revenue of 1.5 billion increased 36.4% year-over-year, driven by both record Invisalign revenue, which surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first time ever and record iTero scanner revenues. These results reflect continued progress in execution of our force strategic growth drivers, which focus on driving international expansion, increasing orthodontist\u2019s utilization of Invisalign, especially with teenagers, enabling GP dentists to treat and refer more Invisalign cases and generating consumer demand from millions of people worldwide and connecting them with Invisalign Doctor.","Turning to the specifics around our fourth quarter results, let's start with the results of our North American region. For North America, Q4 was a good quarter with Invisalign case volume up 5.1% sequentially and 24.2% year-over-year. Sequential growth primarily reflects the seasonality, a seasonally stronger period for GP dentists as patients\u2019 activities in their offices increased after summer holidays. Ortho customers treated more adult patients following the busy teen season. In addition, Q4 Invisalign utilization increased to 3.3 cases per GP dentist and North American Orthos received a record 14 cases per doctor, reflecting continued confidence and uptake of Invisalign system. On a year-over-year basis, strong growth was driven primarily by increased Ortho utilization and continued expansion of our GP customer base. For the full year, both North America Orthos and GP Dentists achieved record annualized utilization of 47 and 8 cases per doctor respectively.","For international doctors, Q4 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 12.7% sequentially and 52.3% year-over-year. Sequential growth reflects a seasonally stronger quarter for EMEA region following summer holidays for doctors and patients, which offset expected decreases from seasonality in APAC, particularly as the Greater China market observed local holidays. On a year-over-year basis, strong Invisalign volume was driven by growth from both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region. ","Year-over-year growth for EMEA was up 42.9%, led by Spain, France and the UK. We also saw strong growth across all of our smaller expansion markets, which include Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And APAC Q4 volumes were up 63% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia with record Invisalign volume in most APAC countries. For the full year, Invisalign volume increased 44.9%, led by growth from China and our core EMEA country markets. In total, international volume represented 38% of worldwide Invisalign case shipments.","Now, turning to the teen market, which makes up 75% of total orthodontic case starts each year. In Q4, 63.5 thousand teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 44.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions and increasingly for younger teens and tweens. For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American Orthos increased 37.8% and international was up 64.7%. Notwithstanding some seasonality during the quarter, given fewer teen case starts, Q4 was a fifth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volume grew faster than adults. ","On a sequential basis, North American ortho teen cases were down as expected as our ortho customers shifted their focus toward adult patient case starts in Q4 following a very busy summer teen season. For the full year, a total of 237,000 teenagers or 26% of our total volume started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, up 40.4% from 2016. ","During the year, we continued to drive adoption of teenage patients through sales and marketing programs, including a major new direct-to-consumer campaign, empathizing teens and moms. In addition, at the beginning of 2017, we launched the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction that combines all the benefits of the most advanced clear aligner system in the world with features for moving the lower jaw forward, while simultaneously aligning the teeth. ","Invisalign teen with mandibular advancement or MATH [ph] as we call it, offers a simpler, more efficient and patient friendly option than functional appliances. MATH was launched in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC and is ramping up nicely across the board, especially in China. To date, we've shipped over 5000 MATH cases outside the United States, half of which were in Q4 alone and we're very excited about the potential for MATH worldwide. However, we do not expect any material contribution in the US from MATH until the back half of 2018, as we continue to work through the 510k regulatory approval process with the FDA, which includes collecting additional data and analysis.","Invisalign brand is one of the most recognized in the dental and orthodontic market. Our integrated consumer marketing programs leverage traditional paying media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. These programs continue to drive demand for Invisalign treatment and are key to adoption in both the teen and adult segments. In 2017, we launched a new Made to Move brand platform for Invisalign, which has been really impactful around the world. ","In North America, we expanded our traditional digital media campaigns, targeting both men and women for the first time and made a significant investment in our marketing to teens and moms. We stepped up our approach to teens by partnering with content developers, teen and mom social media influencers and team brands like AwesomenessTV, which we saw pay off and increases in our consumer website activity and opt-in metrics. ","We also saw a positive impact from the global Made to Move campaign across EMEA and APAC and may have focused heavily on digital, social and web traffic, which resulted in huge increase in their online smile assessments and other KPIs. APAC markets like Singapore and Australia also saw an increase in KPIs based on their focus on social media and local event and influencer driven marketing. ","As a result, in total for the year, there were over 15 million unique visitors to the Invisalign websites worldwide, 1.8 million potential patients search for Invisalign provider on Doc locator, up 41% from 2016. 600,000 consumers completed Invisalign smile assessments on our website, of which 445,000 opted in for follow-up in the Invisalign social media community grew over 42% to 745,000 consumers following the Invisalign brand worldwide. ","You may recall that in January last year, we launched a new smile concierge program in Raleigh, North Carolina with the objective to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment and improve their overall experience by shortening their research cycles and utilizing consumer insights to help our doctors better engage with consumers. Throughout the year, we made great progress from ongoing program improvements in December. We achieved a major milestone with the 6500 Invisalign patients for the smile concierge team. ","Cumulatively, we schedule over 26,000 Invisalign consultations which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign practices every day. We continue to see incredible potential as our doctors\u2019 offices are implementing changes to better engage with consumers that we send to them every day. We've also started to expand the small concierge service outside the United States with our first teams up and running in Singapore, Brazil and Australia, with each of these countries having a great start to the year helping more consumers become Invisalign patients. ","Over the course of the year, we\u2019ll update you on our continued progress in leveraging important learnings about consumer behavior and establishing smile concierges team in EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In 2018, our smile concierge team will be very closely linked to the new Invisalign store pilot that we opened in November, which will utilize our consumer insights to better capture leads coming out of the store experience. The smile concierge team will be utilizing our touch point learnings to reach out to consumers who received a scan but don't schedule an appointment with a doctor. ","In addition, we\u2019ll use our automated text and email services to remind consumers when and where to pick up their aligners or to see a doctor as scheduled. These are just a few of the exciting new ways that we're helping to educate consumers on the benefits of getting a better smile with Invisalign treatment and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice. The Invisalign store pilot program that launched in November is an extension of our long standing direct-to-consumer marketing programs that connect potential patients directly to doctors for Invisalign treatment. ","We're looking at other successful brands and how they use a physical location to engage consumers and extend the brand experience. In this case, we are trying to extend and strengthen what we do through digital ad, social media, PR and TV advertising and our customers own in practice patient marketing. Our pilot store model relies on the doctor and the doctor's office for treatment. We are not treating patients in the store. Instead, we are educating consumers on how Invisalign works, showing them a scan driven simulation of how they might look with straighter teeth and offering to connect interested consumers with a doctor of their choice, so that they subsequently decide to pursue treatment. ","To date, we've learned a lot about creating the right consumer experience with Invisalign system through a store front and are continuing to evolve and make continued progress. In Q1, we will open another pilot store in San Jose, California, near our corporate headquarters. We're planning to open two additional pilot stores on the East Coast sometime in the first half of this year. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these four locations and sharing our progress throughout the year.","Q4 was a strong quarter for iTero and better than expected with revenues up 30.8% sequentially and 37% year-over-year on record iTero scanner shipments. Q4 results reflect continued strength in our GP channel following our GP summit in September as well as sales to our major DSO partners and through our iTero distributor, Patterson Dental. The iTero scanner business was also strong in EMEA and has been growing rapidly in Asia Pacific, especially Japan where we see certification for iTero in Q3. ","Customers are quickly realizing a significant benefit of our iTero scanner platform and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to expand iTero\u2019s footprint worldwide. The iTero scanner is central to our digital approach and overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatment. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case as shipments in place of PBS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. ","For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 64.1%, up from 51.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased to 40.8%, up from 24.9 in Q4 of last year. not only does the iTero scanner provide the best work flow for Invisalign treatment with Invisalign outcomes simulator and progress assessment tool, but it's also seamlessly integrates with downstream restorative workflows, significantly improving their accuracy and precision. iTero is also the only scanner with time lapse technology that makes chair-side consults more productive. ","By scanning patients at every visit using time lapse and comparing historical scans to a current scan, patients see for themselves the changes in their tooth wear, tooth movement and changes in [indiscernible], encouraging them to accept treatment on the chair-side. In Q4, we cited a distribution agreement with Glidewell Dental for our iTero Element scanner in North America with glidewell.io the in-office solution, a chair-side restorative ecosystem designed to simplify the process of prescribing and delivering laboratory quality dental restorations. In 2017, iTero scanners volumes were up 37.5% year-over-year. To date, over 6.3 million orthodontic scans and 2.4 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners.","Finally, in the doctor-directed at home channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub and has 19% equity investment in the company. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners with non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q4, shipments to SDC were down sequentially as expected as SDC increased their own internal capacity. As an investor and supplier to SDC, Align is focused on two things, expanding the market for orthodontic treatment and providing greater access to simple teeth straightening solutions to millions of more people who prioritize convenience and affordability and creating new opportunities for Invisalign doctors by connecting consumers who aren't candidates for SDC\u2019s limited protocols to an Invisalign practice.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Morici","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $421.3 million, up 9.4% from the prior quarter and up 43.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue of $364.2 million was up 6.6% sequentially on higher than expected volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 44.8% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign prices. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially approximately $5 from Q3 to $1305, reflecting higher deferrals related to additional aligners and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by international price increases. ","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $75, reflecting price increases, favorable foreign exchange, product mix as well as the impact of discontinuing distribution and going directly in several regions, partially offset by increased promotional discounts and higher deferrals related to additional aligners. For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 255,000 cases were up 8% sequentially, driven by our EMEA and North America customers. ","Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was up 34.2%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 2.3% sequentially and up 30.7% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 9.2% sequentially and up 16.1% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 52.3% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $57.1 million, up 30.8% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily due to continued global investment and go to market activities and sales promotions as well as shipments to key DSO partners and our US distributor, Patterson Dental.","Moving on to gross margin, fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.5%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.4 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, driven by operational expansion activities. Clear aligner gross margin was up 0.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased ASPs and partially offset by higher manufacturing spend. Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 62%, up 2 points sequentially and up one point year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing efficiencies. Q4 operating expenses were $208.3 million, up sequentially 7.5% and up 37.2% year-over-year, primarily due to increased employee headcount and continued investment in our go to market activity is critical to the growth of our [indiscernible].","Our fourth quarter operating income was a record $109.6 million, up 11% sequentially and up 60.3% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 26%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 2.7 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to leverage operating spend in sales and marketing of higher volumes, partially offset by lower gross margin due to operational expansion activities. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services which created operating expense leverage. ","With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 92.4% and is up by 72.6 points compared to 19.8% in the same quarter last year, which includes $86.6 million in tax expense as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. This is comprised of $76.6 million of mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign on accumulated foreign earnings not previously taxed by the US that we expect to pay over the next eight years and $10 million non-cash write down of our deferred tax assets due to the statutory tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%. ","Going forward, we may repatriate cash back to the US to invest in market expansion opportunities, provide additional working capital and have greater flexibility to fund our stock repurchase program. In accordance with the SEC staff accounting bulletin number 118, we have recorded provisional amounts in the Q4 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the act based on reasonable estimates and information available as the close of the period. We may adjust and refine the provisional amounts over the next year when additional information, analysis and legislative guidance becomes available. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.13, down 87.1% sequentially and down 78% compared to the prior year. Our diluted earnings per share includes 86.6 million or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act.","Moving on to the balance sheet, as of the fourth quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long term investments, were $761.5 million. This compared to $700 million at the end of 2016, an increase of approximately $61.5 million, primarily related to earnings growth. Of our $761.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $271.4 million was held by the US and $490.1 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $322.8 million, up approximately 0.5% sequentially. ","Our overall days sales outstanding, DSO was 69 days, down six days sequentially and down seven days from 76 days in Q4 last year. DSOs have decreased as a result of improved collection activities across all regions. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $162.3 million, up $81.3 million compared to prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $92.8 million. ","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $69.5 million, primarily relating to building purchases and improvements, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity as well as our global expansion efforts, included a new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China which will open in the second half of 2018. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of stock for $50 million under the April 2016 repurchase program. We have $200 million remaining available for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization.","Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2017 results. In 2017, we shipped a 931,000 Invisalign cases, up 31.4%. This reflects 44.9% volume growth from our international doctors and 24.3% volume growth from our North American doctors. Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 37.5% over 2016. Total revenue was a record $1.5 billion, up 36.4% year-over-year with Invisalign revenues breaking above $1 billion for the first time. ","Full year operating income of $353.6 million, up 42.1% versus 2016 and operating margin at 24%, up 0.9 points versus prior year. Free cash flow was $242.8 million. For the year, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of Align\u2019s stock for $103.8 million. 2017 diluted earnings per share was $2.83, which includes 86.6 million or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, comprised of a $10 million write down of our deferred tax assets and a mandatory deem repatriation tax of $76.6 million.","With that, let's turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to continue to grow sequentially. For North America, we expect Q1 to be seasonally up for both GP dentists and Orthos. For our scanner business, we expect a sequential decrease following a strong year end. In addition, capital equipment purchases are seasonally slower in Q1. As Joe commented earlier, this quarter we supplied fewer aligners to SDC in Q4 2017 compared to prior quarters. ","We are anticipating this trend to continue as SDC continues to ramp up their own manufacturing capacity. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 264,000 to 269,000 cases, up approximately 27% to 29% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million, an increase of approximately 29% to 32% year-over-year. ","We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 74.3% to 75%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning operations, partially offset by higher ASPs. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $223.5 million to $227.5 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go to market activities. Q1 operating margin should be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5%. Our effective tax rate including an excess tax benefit of about $22 million should be approximately 2%. ","We expect a $1 million to $2 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 82 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.98. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q1 to be approximately $65 million to $70 million and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10.5 million to $11 million.","Now, let me turn to our full year view. We anticipate 2018 revenue to be at the high end of our long term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be close to the high end of that model. While we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2017. We expect operating margins to be approximately flat to 2017 result as we plan to continue to fund our investments to fuel growth. We expect the equity loss for our investment in SmileDirectClub to be $1 million to $2 million per quarter. ","We expect our tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 18%, which includes approximately $24 million of excess tax benefits. As we\u2019ve seen historically, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating income to account for somewhere in the range of 56% to 58% of our full year results. We expect capital expenditures for 2018 eighteen to be in the range of $200 million to $230 million, primarily due to operational expansion and ongoing growth of the business. ","Finally, regarding the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, we plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 by applying the full retrospective method. We have assessed the financial statement impact of adoption, including but not limited to volume based discount programs, sales commissions and the identification of performance obligations and are continuing to evaluate the transition and disclosure requirements of the standard. We anticipate that adoption of the standard will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks, John and thanks again for joining us. 2017 was a great year for Align and I'm very pleased with our strong performance across all key regions, customer channels and product lines. This year, not only do we celebrate our 20th year in business, we also achieved several major milestones. We reach our millionth Invisalign team and our 5 millionth Invisalign patient. Invisalign volume in EMEA exceeded 200,000 cases for the first time. We opened our first treatment planning operations in China and Germany. ","China became our second largest country market, next to the US. Invisalign revenues exceeded 1 billion for the first time ever. As I reflect on these achievements, I want to take a minute to thank more than the 130,000 Invisalign providers around the world who helped us expand the market for orthodontics using the Invisalign system. They\u2019re increasing confidence in using Invisalign clear aligners to treat moderate to complex cases as reflected in our record utilization across all customer channels and we're grateful for their partnership. ","We're continuing innovating to deliver new technology and solutions that provide Invisalign doctors with the right tools, support and services to keep their practices flourishing. Even with growth rate significantly above the industry, our market opportunity is enormous and getting larger every day. With less than 10% share of the world orthodontic case starts each year, we have a long way to go to make clear aligners a standard of care, but our goal is to do just that. There are more than 300 million people around the world who would or could benefit from straighter teeth. Reaching out to those consumers, helping them understand treatment options and getting them started in treatment will require new approaches and new models. We're committed to doing that in partnership with our customers. ","For 2018, we'll continue to focus on and execute our four key strategic priorities and I feel really good about our plans. We're continuing to expand our business in EMEA, APAC and will accelerate our investment in LATAM and Canada, bringing more resources closer to our customers and launching direct-to-consumer advertising in some markets like Canada for the first time. The teenage market remains our number one priority across the ortho channel. For the first time, we will focus on teens and their moms and our consumer marketing programs in the EMEA region, making it easier for GP dentists to treat more cases also enables them to refer more complex ones to specialists. ","So we are creating dedicated GP resources across our sales and marketing organizations to ensure that we have a better understanding of how to drive Invisalign adoption among GP dentists and support their unique customer needs, including restorative and aesthetic dentistry. And finally, the Invisalign brand and our consumer marketing programs are key differentiators for the company. So we'll continue to invest and to build capabilities that enable us to talk directly to consumers, improve the overall experience with our brand, connect more people than ever with Invisalign practices and ensure that they get started in treatment with Invisalign clear aligners every time.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator and we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is with Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this evening. Joe, I just wanted to start with the revenue outlook for growth to be at the high end of the long term range. Obviously, that still implies a healthy level of growth, but down a little bit from what you guys saw in 2017. You\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the call obviously talking about the initiatives that you've put in place and the opportunity that the company still has. So I was just wondering if you can maybe help us understand what the key drivers of the outlook are for this year and what if anything has changed from your point of view.","Joe Hogan","Well, I think nothing's really changed in that sense. There's some amplitude that we're talking about in the sense of what we're calling right now. But overall, we feel good momentum in the business and what we're trying to convey with you is we stay within the volume ranges that we've talked about before. But, we're just going to look quarter-to-quarter, we continue to look at the same drivers, I mean, continue to look at APAC being strong, Europe will be strong and North America, particularly around teens and our focus there and iTero scanners continue to go off well. So overall, I really feel good about our forecast and will be more and more clear obviously as we come back to you after the first quarter.","Nathan Rich","And just a follow up on the outlook, does it contemplate any change in the competitive landscape in 2018 and if you were to see a new competitor come to market, how would that impact your view of the year?","Joe Hogan","I think Nathan, we've been very I think clear over the last year or so that we do expect competition in 2018. In these forecasts, we are reflecting any kind of competition we might see, but there's been nothing out there recently that's changed any position that we've had from a competitor standpoint. So these forecasts do reflect how we see the marketplace and that includes potential competition as we get into longer parts of this year.","Operator","Our next question is with Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Can you speak to your retail store contact and how you envision that progressing, has there been any sort of surprises thus far with the initiative and how will the smile concierge team be involved, like do you plan to leverage your smile concierge build out in other countries as well to then leverage the retail store concept there or is it too early on that process?","Joe Hogan","Well, we are translating Erin the small concierge program overseas. We will look at it, we will move it into APAC this year and also move it into EMEA. What\u2019s nice about it is it\u2019s scalable right now. We can take what we've learned in North America and there's a lot of IT involved and a lot of processes in a sense of how you turn a consumer into patients that we\u2019re able to I think plug and play much better now, we have that experience. That's really what that understanding is what led to the Invisalign store, the pilot that we currently have in San Francisco is that just wanted to move this even closer to patients. ","And remember again, we're not doing any kind of diagnosis or anything like that. We do scans in these shops and we show potential patients or consumers, what their smiles could look like in two different sets of -- two approaches what we call signature and deluxe. I would say what we're doing, we continue to -- it is a pilot and we work through the workflow between us and the doctor and us and the patient and we refined that pretty well over the last 60 days and we're making progress. ","That should give us the confidence to announce that we're going to move a store in to San Jose and also two on the East Coast this year, but we'll be very clear with you about what we learned, but again, this is all about how you turn a consumer into a patient and this is as much -- this is a doctor model. We're working with our doctors to make this happen. And so how you touch these consumers, how the frictionless way that you move a consumer into a doctor, how fast that information can be received, all that is really important in this customer journey and we're learning more and more about that and how to do it better. So we're optimistic about it and we do this -- have it on our future plans. And obviously, just like the concierge services, we have success here and we have a model we think scalable. We\u2019ll look at where that might fit in different countries around the world.","Erin Wright","And can you give us an update on mandibular advancements here, what sort of data has been requested from the FDA and what sort of visibility do you have on timing of the launch. I guess what are the next data points and also how traction for that product I guess hoping to build adoption across the teen market outside of the US. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Erin, this is really, it\u2019s actually simple. Sounds like a drug or anything like that. They just need more data at the FDA and they just want to have more comfort with the safety and the efficacy of the product line, so we're supplying that data. We expect hopefully we\u2019ll be through that by the second half of this year and then we'll move on. I mean, I talked about the 5,000 cases that we did last year with 2500 of those being in the fourth quarter alone. Honestly, the feedback that we get from our patients overseas is tremendous. I mean when we look at the device that we've replaced through this, it's amazing like a twin block device. Let\u2019s normally use that there. ","When you can actually move this jaw forward as comfortably as we do with math, but also straighten teen\u2019s teeth at the same time. It's really an amazing invention. So I think that's part of the way the FDA wants more and more information because they really haven't seen a device like this before, but we feel very confident we'll be able to supply their informational needs and as we move in to the second half of this year, we'll give you more clarity on exactly where that stands.","Operator","Our next question is with Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Jamie on for Rich Newitter. A quick question that I have I guess is on the teen segment. Of course, you guys posted nice performance this quarter, so I'm kind of thinking about when you guys think this market could be potentially reaching an inflection point and how we should be thinking about the additional investments in your direct-to-consumer campaigns and really seeing the payoff there and how it translates into further growth in 2018?","Joe Hogan","It\u2019s Joe again. Look I would say we've done one in a row on teens and we have more work to do on this, but we have to put a lot of money into the system in the sense of educating moms and teens, peer to peer training for doctors, all these things. And so I'd say, the whole idea, enthusiasm around the tipping point, we're not there yet. We have to continue to see this market and push this market in order to get it going. We're confident in our ability to do that based on what we experienced in the last five quarters, but not necessarily ready to claim victory and that this has its own momentum at this point in time.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just one other quick question on scanners, I guess you were saying for you, if I heard you correctly, for the full year 2018, you're not expecting the same sort of growth for the scanner business. So just kind of on that front, what sorts of expectations or assumptions do you have baked in for 2018 for growth in this market.","John Morici","This is John. We would expect scanner growth to be approximately equal to Invisalign.","Operator","Our next question is with Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Joe, maybe for you, in 2018, another great year of revenue growth expectations and another year of sort of healthy spend expectations as well. So maybe if you can talk to where that spend is being allocated. Clearly, there's a return, but what is it -- is it more reps, is it additional DTC, is it both and then how do we think about that spend maybe throughout the year in terms of reaching sort of the critical mass on the rep front and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Joe Hogan","Jon, what we're doing is we\u2019re basically magnifying the investments that we\u2019ve made in 2017, so you'll see again investment in teen, broader advertisements, so we now help to drive GP volume growth, particularly in United States too. Investments in our concierge service, but behind that too is what you alluded to also is more field people on the ground calling on customers to actually drive the business. So there's a direct correlation -- when you look at the correlation between our investment in these particular areas to drive demand and the demand we're able to drive and we can see that we realize through that, we're continuing on the same plane that we have before, Jon.","I think I'm behind you, I know your question is leverage. As actually when that leverage does occur, I mean that's \u2013 I\u2019m voiding that -- it's just -- I don't this thing is not self-sustaining yet. We have to invest in to drive demand in this business and to educate consumers and particularly and to train doctors. And so I don't see that going away in 2018, Jon.","Jon Block","To shift gears, I know it's early, but I do want to sort of follow-up with the store front initiative. Clearly, the model, it gets the volume into the doc\u2019s offices and you've been very vocal about that and it's unlike that of SDC, nut what are you hearing from your customers, maybe even if it's only specific to San Francisco, are there any that are sort of unsettled by called the fixed economics for Express type cases and they shouldn\u2019t be saying, hey, I'm getting 500 bucks instead of 50 for doing an SDC markup, but have they come around and what are you hearing in the early days from that customer base?","Joe Hogan","Jon, from a San Francisco store standpoint, when you ask the doctors around San Francisco about the store, there's enthusiastic support for it, because they're close to it and they see what we're doing. But if you go around the country, there is anxiety with doctors in the sense of what is Align trying to do with these stores and how to go about it. So we continue to try to communicate that this is a doctor's model and we're trying to drive that demand as much as we can through the orthodontics, and also the GP. ","To your specific question about the signature product and our cost forward, I mean that hasn't been a favorite of our doctors that we set that price, but obviously there is a market price for around that, but that kind of -- and I call it anterior teeth movement which is basically just a smile kind of improvement that we know that patients really want and we feel that we have to deliver. There are some docs that readily support it and they are happy with it. ","There's other ones that aren't happy with it too and we continue to let them make that selection, whether they want to participate in that or not. We also have our deluxe cases as we haven't set a priceline that the orthodontists have been very happy with in a sense. So, we do have a significant number of patients that offer the Deluxe too when they understand potential bite changes and what that might do for the long term dentition.","Operator","Our next question is with Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Zach Wachter","This is actually Zach Wachter on for Steve. Thanks for the questions. Joe, I wondered if you saw the 3Shape and 3M release out today on the collaboration and any early thoughts on that.","Joe Hogan","Yeah. Zach, the one thing I was kind of stunned with was that basically 3M admitted that their scanner doesn't function properly for digital marketplace. I mean that surprised me more than anything. With that, it doesn't surprise me that they would go to 3Shape because 3Shape does have a good Confocal imaging scanner as we know, partially supported by our technology, but that's just to be expected in that sense. But -- the real part that surprised me was really that the def scanner that 3M currently has apparently will be retired in some way. So as far as what does that mean from a competitive standpoint, it doesn't change anything at all. It just means that 3M felt that they needed a different front end from a digital standpoint in their system than what they currently manufacture.","Zach Wachter","And as far as the 3Shape transition on the scan submissions, how are you doing in terms of back filling those volumes and what do you think about the overall impact there?","Joe Hogan","That\u2019s like we didn't call our forecast any impact. We have customers upset at us because we had to make that move and wanted to make that move. But we're working through that, through offers of iTero that help offset this and also through subsidizing some submissions we did have in a fundamental way than the analog way in order to do impressions. So right now, we're not calling any kind of a downside based on that. We emphasize with customers have been effective from a workflow standpoint, we're doing everything we can to mitigate that and make it as easy as possible.","Zach Wachter","And there have been a couple of questions on store front, I wonder on the -- specifically on the consumer finance program, separate from the store, if there have been any early learnings there that you can share and any incremental volume left to speak to.","Joe Hogan","These are good questions. We\u2019ll tell Steve how good you are. John's going to answer that question for you.","John Morici","Look, we're doing a pilot now in some key markets and learning a lot and working through to make sure that we have the best possible patient and customer experience through this. So we're learning, making sure that it gets rolled out in the right way and you'll see a larger rollout coming in the future.","Operator","Our next question is with John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Joe, given the very strong growth that you just finished up in \u201917, how do you feel about the manufacturing infrastructure\u2019s ability to handle it? If you had similar growth in \u201918 as you just put up, would there be any strains on the system and whereas in particular and do you have to put some more capital work there to stay ahead of that?","Joe Hogan","John, yes, we do. And we do that almost systematically. We make sure that we have enough SLA equipment and capability and whereas, obviously, we're going to have extra capacity now coming on in China that will help take some pressure off that facility too. We also could have a bottleneck on the patient and -- when you look at Costa Rica and what we do overall from the case assessment, case prescriptions standpoint, but we tend of stay up at that and we had a big challenge last year because we had a lot of volume come out as pretty quickly and we were able to recover and get it done. So I think the job right now I feel good about our operations team, our ability to anticipate that, to have the kind of capacity available upfront to get this done. So we don't look at that as being an issue in 2018.","John Kreger","And then just one follow-up, can talk a bit about key new innovations. So you gave us a nice update on mandibular advancement, as we think about \u201918, is there anything out on the horizon that you would maybe care to preview.","Joe Hogan","Well, I think we've talked a lot about rapid palatal expansion, I mean we talked about that about 18 months ago. We\u2019ve given updates on that, that technology continues to progress. We're enthusiastic about it. That's rapid palatal expansion, John. You put in, in this case a device, it replaces a device where you use actually a wrench today to turn it, it's very crude in the sense of how you expand the palatal, that this would be a digital way with plastic and being able to expand the palatal on a regular basis. ","We also have a product called dental expansion, which will expand your upper arch also Invisalign with Invisalign aligners also. So those are the big products that we're moving toward. When you think about the teen marketplace, and we call tweens and teens and 30% of that marketplace is basically rapid palatal expansion and math, mandibular phase 1 kind of things. And so that technology is really aimed at making us more -- have a more substantial footprint and capability in that teen segment.","Operator","Our next question is with Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","John I think as you mentioned on SDC, maybe revenue is coming down a little bit in the forward quarters here after a couple of quarters in a row, near 10 million as they continue to ramp their aligner manufacturing. I guess my question just why do they keep investing in manufacturing capacity. Obviously, they have a good partner in you guys, you guys have plenty of manufacturing, I know, maybe some strain on it and whereas as we were just discussing, but why the investments there still and why not just continue to use you guys for most of their aligner needs?","Joe Hogan","Jeff, I think it looks at separate company. They're looking at this as how they want to run their company and decisions that they make to invest and produce their own product. We take anything that comes externally that they don't want to manufacture and it varies. As you've seen kind of quarter by quarter, based on what they produce versus what they go outside with, but it's an internal decision that they make.","Jeff Johnson","And then when I try to triangulate, I take 1Q guide kind of your 1.8 versus 2.8 EBIT guide and think about kind of what's going on in the business right now, help me out just understand what looks like it could be a down margin in the first quarter and I know John is going to give you a pass on that, but let me just push a little bit on it. How much of that is just your opening, Cologne recently opening in China in the treatment planning, China manufacturing costs or manufacturing facility being built out, it just seems like you are doing quite a bit right now, a couple of new storefronts, all that stuff. Is that really the driver of just some elevated expenses here in the near term or should we be thinking anything ASP driven or anything else kind of core fundamental to the business just versus some investments that need to be made right now.","John Morici","Yes. Jeff, it's mostly investments. If you think about how 2017 played out, from the investments early on in the year and progressively as we went quarter by quarter, we've got increasing operating leverage. That's the same type of play that we would have for 2018. We're investing, we continue to follow the strategy that we have and you'll see those investments throughout the year and first quarter, it's not as much operating leverage, but to guide something flat on a year-over-year basis, around that 24%, you would expect that some of that increase as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question is with Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Kevin on for Matt today. I wanted to follow up on a previous question on manufacturing. I know China is -- the facility there is coming on later this year. I was just curious on the primary investments there, are there any updates to new printers or materials and I guess more broadly with the large growing cash balance and possible repatriation of some cash back into the US, how the company thinks about the best use of cash at the moment?","John Morici","Yeah. I can start with that one. I mean when we think about our China operation, I mean, as kind of been noted, when we talk about investments that we have to make up, to accommodate the manufacturing, we're always investing. So now, we're going to add to that capacity that we need in China. So it's really a shift in some cases from Mexico to China and we'll continue to make those investments as needed from an overall growth standpoint. And when we look at our cash position that we have, as we said on previously, we're going to look at what strategically makes the most sense to bring cash back where we need it, where we can properly use that cash for future investments. But in other cases like China, we\u2019ll leave cash there to be able to grow that operation that we need. So we're going to look at this very strategically as to how we best fund our growth.","Unidentified Analyst","And then lastly, I was just -- just looking at the percentage of cases done through the iTero digital scanning process, it goes up nicely every quarter and it was right around 50% in North America this time last year. So large incremental improvement. Ideally, you're looking for 100% there, but is there an internal target that company is looking for in \u201918 or the coming years? And secondly, how would you think about any kind of savings from fewer adjustments being sent back or chipping the molds out. Is it more significant than we might assume?","Joe Hogan","It\u2019s Joe. We don't really -- don't set numbers year to year to think where we're going to be, but you saw a ten point increase last year in North America alone. So I mean we expect that going forward, as scanners are more and more adopted, obviously, fewer impressions are going to be done. So, ideally, you'll get to 100% someday, but getting to 80%, 85% is probably going to be, it\u2019s the top of the area because a lot of, particularly on the GP side, they will be maybe reluctant to invest in the scanner until they know that they have enough Invisalign volume to really support that. But I -- as far as the savings of doing that, we actually obviously don't have -- you have better fitting aligners. We know all those things occur from that, but we don't have any quantification in the sense of the economics or changes in that way that I can share with you that I know.","Operator","Our last question is with Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Just a couple of housekeeping questions, John. In terms of the 1Q revenue guidance, 400 to 410, pretty rare that we would see a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline if ever. Does that imply -- can you give us some sense of like the actual magnitude of the scanner step down from 4Q into the first quarter and perhaps spike out, whether that largely reflects upfront Patterson shipments that really won\u2019t recur in the first quarter.","John Morici","Brandon, it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, as you pointed out, the revenue is -- the numbers that we guided to is just a pure reflection of what we expect from a scanner standpoint and being the strength of Q4 from a scanner standpoint, it\u2019s a big quarter from a capital standpoint and investment standpoint by our doctors. It doesn't necessarily repeat in Q1. So that's a step down that we see. So it's really what's driving that change and it's been that, it's not unexpected in terms of how we look at Q4 to Q1.","Brandon Couillard","And then secondly in terms of the \u201918 outlook, can you give a sense of where you see your percentage of SmileDirect manufacturing volumes shaken out for the year? And then secondly curious if you\u2019ve finalized plans on whether you expect it to take a little, more or less pricing this year.","John Morici","So, on SmileDirectClub, we would expect about the same volume year-over-year. So what we saw in \u201917 should approximate and repeat in 2018 and that would be included in the overall numbers that we gave. And in terms of ASPs, we increased in the past, we haven't announced any increase in 2018. We will let our customers know in advance and then communicate that afterwards, but our past history has been to include.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, everyone. This concludes our conference call today.

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter, following that I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","2017 is off to a great start with first quarter revenues, volumes, gross margin, and EPS all above expectations. First quarter net revenues were up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign case shipments of 27% year-over-year to a record 38,900 doctors this quarter. These reflect the growth from both our North America and international regions and higher than expected teenage cases across the board, which increased 32% year-over-year.","iTero's scanner revenues increased 47% year-over-year, and were down sequentially as expected. For Q1, North America Invisalign case volume was up 8.4% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by North American orthodontists, with GP Dentists showing improving growth trends. Continued strength in North American ortho channel reflects another record quarter for Invisalign utilization, up 12.6 cases per quarter, which includes substantially higher use by teenager patients, a positive indication for market share gains for metal braces.","In Q1, we expand our adult-focused media buying to target both men and women with specific segment focus. This new buying target built on the historical strength we have had with adult females while also reaching adult males in a much more pointed way than ever before. We saw the results of this new media targeting come through in our sales as strength continued with adult females, and also significant growth with adult males choosing Invisalign treatment.","During the quarter, we launched Invisalign Lite in North America, which was the first introduced in EMEA and includes up to 14 stages of aligners. We also begin titling Invisalign Go in North America in Q1 including with some of our dental service organizations, or DSOs. iGo for short is an aesthetic solution designed to empower general dentists to treat more patients. iGo creates a simplified approach that guides dentists through identifying, planning and treating aesthetic cases.","On a year-over-year basis, shipment growth of 20.3% was driven by increased adoption of Invisalign by orthodontists and continued expansion of our GP customer base. We continue to make good progress with our DSOs, with Invisalign shipments up nearly 50% year-over-year in Q1, significantly higher than non-DSO practices.","DSOs are leaders in adopting new technology and innovation in dental industry. They were the first to consolidate practices, automate, processes and drive greater efficiencies in order to scale their operations.","The next phase in the DSO industry shift will be driven by the consumer and their preference for everything digital, which we have branded DSO 3.0 in our new marketing programs and collateral. Consumers today want digital experiences to provide them with more insight to the treatment and options and what steps to take in order to achieve a healthy lifestyle.","By leveraging our technologies, iTero scanning, Invisalign treatment plans, progress tracking application, time-lapse features, our DSOs will be able to collect data on their active patients and tailor dentistry and orthodontics the way their patients want to consume it digitally. Working together with DSOs, we can help accelerate the industry shift the full digital practices much quicker and more effectively than with other companies.","As part of our newly formed Americas region, in Q1, we completed the acquisition of our distributor in Brazil, which includes a small team of employees who'll be based in our S\u00e3o Paulo offices in Latin America. Brazil is estimated to have approximately 1.4 million new orthodontic case starts each year, and employs nearly 20% of the world's dentists.","As the world's second largest market for cosmetic interventions, Brazil represents a tremendous growth potential for Align and this acquisition will help us establish our leadership position in Latin America and support our long-term growth strategy.","Q1 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 11.4% sequentially and up 41.3% year-over-year. The better than expected sequential increase was driven by growth in both the EMEA and APAC regions.","In EMEA, Q1 volumes were up 38.8% year-over-year. We had a record quarter of growth across nearly all country markets as our TFM model continues gaining traction across the ortho channel with Spain, the U.K. and Germany leading the way.","In Q1, we introduced Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in certain country markets in EMEA and launched Invisalign Go in the UK, France and Germany. We also completed the acquisition of our EMEA distributor, which includes opening our first office in the Middle East, which gives us direct access to customers and distribution partners across Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltics, Turkey, Monaco, Israel, Cyprus, the Middle East and Africa.","In Asia Pacific, Q1 volumes were up 45.2% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia, New Zealand. In Q1, we launched Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Asia and more than 800 doctors attending the peer-to-peer launch event.","We also held a South Asia forum with a record 200 doctors and participated in New Zealand's Association of Orthodontists forum. Finally in South Korea, we transferred all Invisalign practices currently managed by our network partner to a direct coverage model. This gives us 100% direct coverage of the Korean market, and will enable our team to continue developing the market for clear aligners and help accelerate growth and adoption in the Invisalign treatment.","Turning to the teen market, for Q1, 49,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, up 11.3% sequentially and 31.6% year-over-year. North America ortho shipment growth was well above the three year average both sequentially and year-over-year.","International case shipments of teenage patients increased both sequentially and year-over-year as well, with Q1 teen shipments representing about 30% of total teenage cases. In Q1, we introduced the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC.","Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement combines the benefits of the most advanced clear aligner system in the world with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth. This new solution offers a simpler, more efficient and patient-friendly treatment option than functional appliances and without the need for elastics typically use to treat teen Class II patients. It's not available in the U.S. yet. It's pending 510(k) approval from regulatory.","In Q1, we're excited to launch our new global Made to Move campaign. This is the first time we've had an integrated campaign approach for consumer and professional audience across all regions. The multi-channel national consumer campaign will reach potential patients through TV and digital advertising, social media and PR programs. Launched first in North America, we'll begin to extend our Made to Move campaign in other key country markets beginning in May.","While it's still very early, our new campaign is already driving over 40% higher engagement in digital media versus prior media, and followers across Invisalign's social channels were up 13% this quarter. We're also seeing the effectiveness of the new target audience in media planning. In Q2, we'll launch a significant push to drive consumer demand and conversion with moms and teenagers.","We will dial up our investment in marketing to moms with a national multi-touch campaign under the Made to Move campaign umbrella. And in mid-May, we'll launch our national campaign marketing to teenagers. The national campaign will utilize key social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat and YouTube to raise awareness of clear aligners with custom programming for teens.","In Q1, our scanner revenues increased 46.9% year-over-year and decreased 33% sequentially as expected. Given we worked through the backlog for iTero elements from the end of last year, these results are more reflective of a typical capital equipment buying cycle, which is softer in Q1.","This past March, at the International Dental Show, IDS we call it, in Cologne. We had a greater presence and showcased iTero and Invisalign Go and the benefits of the combination with applications such as Invisalign Progress Tracking.","We also previewed the time lapse application that provides dentists with the ability to compare scans over time to instantly visualize changes in patient's tooth wear movement and gingival recession. Overall, positive interest, as we continue to expand our presence among GPs in EMEA.","Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q1, total Invisalign case submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 54.4%, up over 10 percentage points from the same quarter last year, which reflects an acceleration in case shipments with intraoral scanners, especially by North American orthodontists.","Q1 was our first full quarter supplying clear aligners to SmileDirectClub, and shipments to this new channel were solid. At the beginning of the year, SmileDirectClub launched a consumer advertising campaign that has performed well and is extending the message of treatment with clear aligners versus braces. They've also doubled their network of SmileShops where potential patients can schedule a scan or have 3D impressions and photos taken.","Overall, we remain excited about the long-term potential for the at-home doctor-directed market and working with SmileDirectClub to bring better smiles to more people.","With that, I'll turn it over \u2013 the call to John.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our first quarter financial results. Total company revenue for the first quarter was a record $310.3 million, up 5.8% from the prior quarter and up 30% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue up $282.4 million was up 12.3% sequentially, driven primarily by better than expected Invisalign shipments and higher Invisalign ASPs.","Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth up 28.5% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by foreign exchange rates. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $40 from Q4 to $1,270, reflecting lower promotional activity.","On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $15, primarily due to price increases, partially offset by increased promotional discounts, product shift to low stage products and foreign exchange.","For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 208,100 cases were up 9.5% sequentially, driven primarily by North American orthodontists and international doctors. Year-over-year Invisalign case growth volume was 27.1% driven by growth across all regions as well as expansion of our customer base predominantly from the Asia Pacific region.","For North American orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 13.6% sequentially, and up 27.5% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 2% sequentially and up 11.4% year-over-year.","For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 11.4% sequentially and 41.3% year-over-year. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was a record 5.4 cases per doctor, up from 4.9 in Q1 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 12.6, up from 10.4 the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.1, up slightly from 3.0 the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0, up from 4.7 in Q1 last year, reflecting continued expansion of our customer base in Asia Pacific.","In Q1, we added 3,260 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which 980 were new North American doctors and 2,280 of which were new international doctors. This compared to 3,700 in Q4 and 2,480 total doctors trained in the same quarter last year. Our scanner and services revenue for the first quarter was $27.9 million, down 33% sequentially and up 46.9% year-over-year.","Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, up 0.8 points sequentially and 0.2 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.9%, up 0.4 points sequentially, primarily due to leveraging our manufacturing costs over higher volumes, higher Invisalign ASPs and partially offset by increased aligners per case.","Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case, as we continue to treat more complex cases, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 56.1%, down 4.9 points sequentially primarily due to a slight increase in excess and obsolescence reserves and higher freight costs.","Scanner segment gross margin was up 11.1 points year-over-year, primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower manufacturing and servicing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to our previous scanner. Q1 operating expenses were $174 million, up sequentially by $22.1 million or 14.5% primarily related to increased employee head count, commissions associated with higher volumes and marketing spend as a result of our investments in geographic expansion, our new advertising campaign and the commercialization of new products. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating expenses were up 36.7%, reflecting the aforementioned investments.","Our first quarter operating margin was 19.9%, down 3.4 points sequentially and 2.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily due to increased head count and marketing expenses as we continue to grow our business. On a year-over-year basis, decreased operating margin primarily reflects the higher operating expenses as we invest in head count, geographic expansion and new products in order to increase the adoption and accelerate the growth of our business.","With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was minus 11.4%, which includes $21.3 million in excess tax benefits and is down by approximately 31.2 points compared to Q4 of 2016. In our first quarter of 2017, we adopted accounting standards update entitled improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. Under this new standard, excess tax benefits and efficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement for the reporting period in which they occur.","We also supply aligners to SmileDirectClub and therefore, revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reported results, although they were immaterial to the company this quarter. Additionally, we also report our share of SmileDirectClub's losses below operating margin and our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee net of tax.","This Q1 loss net of tax was approximately $1.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.85 compared to $0.59 reported in Q4 and $0.50 reported in the same quarter last year. First quarter earnings per share included the benefit of $21.3 million or $0.26 per share from excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation in accordance with the new standard.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the first quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investments were $644.2 million. This compared to $700 million at the end of 2016, a decrease of approximately $56 million, primarily related to the purchase of our new headquarters building. Of the $644.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $222.7 million was held by the U.S. and $421.5 million was held by our international entities.","Q1 accounts receivable balance was $267.1 million, up approximately 8% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 77 days, up one day sequentially and up 10 days year-over-year.","The increase is a result of our ERP and other related systems implementation last July, which have impacted the timing of our customer collections. We anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several more quarters as we work through these changes.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $47.6 million. During the quarter, we used $36.5 million to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $59.6 million, primarily related to the purchase of our new facilities in San Jose, California, as well as equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity and building improvement.","During the first quarter, we've repurchased approximately 40,000 shares of stock or $3.8 million, which completes the April 2014 repurchase plan. We have $300 million available for repurchase under the 2016 repurchase program that was announced on April 28, 2016.","With that, let's turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For our international markets, expect seasonally higher period for APAC and EMEA. For North America, seasonally up for orthos and GP dentists.","For our scanner business, Q2 equipment purchases are seasonally higher. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 221,000 to 224,000 cases, up approximately 25% to 27% over the same period a year ago, reflecting continued strong demand across all channels and regions.","We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $340 million to $345 million, an increase of 26% to 28% year-over-year. We expect Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 74% to 75%, reflecting a higher mix of iTero business and Align manufacturing expansion in Asia Pacific.","We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $180 million to $184 million, up quarter-over-quarter primarily due to increased head count, increased marketing expenses related to our new Invisalign brand and teen campaigns.","Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our effective tax rate included a windfall benefit of $2 million to $3 million should be approximately 21%. We estimate that Q2 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction to not significantly impact EPS and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases.","Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.74, which includes approximately $0.03 of excess tax benefits. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $30 million to $35 million.","Now, let me turn to our view of 2017. Given the stronger than expected results we've seen to-date, we now anticipate 2017 total revenue to be at the high-end of our long-term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at the high-end of that model.","Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we remain comfortable with the operating margin for the full year to be flat to slightly up from 2016 operating margin of 23%.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John. In closing, I'm pleased with our continued process and execution of our strategic growth drivers. The dental industry remains healthy and our customers continue to report solid patient traffic in their offices. I just returned from the AAO meeting in San Diego this week and was excited to see the level of activity in our booth and the interest level in our products, especially for teenagers as we kickoff the summer teen season with our new teen-focused campaign.","We had 2,000 doctors and their staff visited our booth and 300 attendees participated in our iTero, Iron Records scanning challenge, where an iTero scan was completed in under one minute for the first time in competition. We will be in Dubai in May hosting our EMEA summit with over 400 customers attending the two day peer-to-peer event. We've got a lot going on in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming financial conference and meetings.","I'll now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first person comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much. I guess, just looking at the significant step up in case growth per ortho in North America. And in particular, Joe, you highlighted a couple times on the call that the impressive teen growth, which accelerated materially. I'm curious you had a few initiatives at play in the quarter. Anything you can share on how much of the teen growth specifically within ortho North America was because of things like the teen challenge versus some of the more tactical changes you had within the sales force. And I'm thinking about doc locator and things of that nature.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Bob, it's a good question. (26:05) going into quarter two is unfortunately, we don't do single variable equations around here. We have a number of things we've done with teens. And again, we'll make it more complicated as we get into more intense advertising in the second quarter. But you mentioned teen challenge, we think certainly had an impact in this sense, I think, some of the changes we've made on Doc Locator in a sense of the specificity of the patient directed into accounts, is part of that also.","Also our next level partnership parts with customers, which basically takes customers to another level depending upon the share of business that we're going to see or the accelerated growth level that it can provide to us. Remember, Bob, when you go back about 75% of the normal orthodontic cases in the United States are teen-based. So if you want to do more Invisalign, it's going to be hard to just dip into adults if you really want to increase in that sense and you have to look at your teen business too. So I'd say those three major valuables is what really we drove from a North American standpoint for teen growth in the first quarter.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And so no one stood out more than other?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then I guess...","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Couldn't separate it.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then, I guess just my follow-up on the early recently launched products that you mentioned like Invisalign Lite, Invisalign Go, mandibular advancement. Given those are still relatively new within the case numbers that you're sharing, how should we think about these products helping accelerate or play into case growth as we move throughout the year?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I can't give you \u2013 John can help you on the dimensions of it. But I'd say when you talk about the mandibular advancement, which is a completely different animal than the \u2013 like the 15 stage we have for Lite. The Lite product fits really well when you think about E5, E10 and now E15. Customers can understand it they can integrate it.","We saw really rapid uptake with that product line. When you come up with new products in this business like mandibular advancement, the infusion rate into the marketplace is slow. You really \u2013 you have dentists and orthodontists who want to try the product, they want to see how it works. They're just cautious on the front-end until they gain confidence with it.","So I mean, mandibular advancement, remember we don't have a 5 and 10-K in the United States yet. We have to \u2013 that will occur later this year. We hope so. But we'll launch it directly around the world. That product is truly a breakthrough.","We have to work hard from a peer-to-peer standpoint to help to promote it, whatever. But it gives us more credibility again in that teen market than we had before. But I wouldn't look at significant \u2013 I wouldn't look at material numbers from mandibular advancement in 2017 in any way, it will be how fast we can infuse that product in the marketplace.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you so much.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Bob","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, good afternoon. So I've never been someone who congratulated a company on a great quarter, and I'm not going to do that here, but even it was a great quarter. But I'm good going to be the first to congratulate you on joining the $10 billion market cap club here in the aftermarket.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. That's great.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, hopefully I was first in the queue on that one. Just a couple for me. I mean I completely agree, of course, with Bob that even when you look at the quarter, you have to take a step back and say, wow, this is the fastest growth I've seen in \u2013 certainly in my model, it's fairly remarkable to step up. Teen really jumps out. I wonder if you could sort of hypothesize for me about how important the one week aligner change that was specifically, I know you called it out briefly. But could you just dive a little bit deeper there?","And could you give us a sense for \u2013 specifically in the U.S., because a lot of investors really like to focus on this point. Just how much faster teen growth was relative to the 2016 trend? You mentioned it was faster, but can you give us any more granularity there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I'll take the first one. I give John the second one on this one, Steve. On our growth trial on one week wear piece again, it's hard to pull that signal out from the volume noise, I'd call it. But what we see is, we're seeing rapid uptake by our orthodontists and GPs on moving to seven day kind of aligner wear.","We're also getting good feedback in a sense that helps them in a close cycle with patients to know that those particular episodes are going to last some time \u2013 half the time of when another one was. So it becomes another item in that discussion that's really helpful. So it's certainly helping us, again, but I can't quantify to the extent of what it is. As far as the U.S. and the faster piece that you mentioned before, John will do it, Steve.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, with your question, specifically on teen growth in the U.S.? Or was...","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Exactly.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, teen growth, we have an overall growth model built in. This is definitely faster than we had built in initially and that's what led to some of our offside that we saw in the first quarter. So teen was definitely stronger than we would've modeled out so far this year.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. And I think \u2013 just adding to what John said, Steve, the comment that we made about teen \u2013 North American ortho teen growth being faster than the last three year average. That gives you a couple of things to look at.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as I was at the Align booth at IDS, I thought \u2013 look, the message that I'm getting here from the team is very clearly that this just almost isn't an orthodontics company anymore. This is a company that wants to \u2013 and has now taken a big step towards becoming a bigger part of the doc office is sort of consumer brand. And I understand that your ambitions are to become a true consumer power, maybe the Nike of oral healthcare.","Joe, it'd be really helpful now that you've seen some of the progress with these initiatives. And some of the progress with SDC for that matter, if you could just sort of refresh us on your thinking on the path there and how this plays into your thinking about the 15 to 25 range with the business really sitting at the high-end? Thanks so much.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, first of all, I mean you saw our presence at IDS. We had a strong present at AAO in San Diego. But I hear your comments like that, one thing I want to make sure is that we're not looking at ourselves as a general dentistry company. We do clear aligner systems and we do scanners and we don't have the kind of penetration into marketplace we think we should have here and anywhere in the world. And so we'll stay focused on those items. So I don't want anyone to think that we're trying to broaden our wings to become more of a general dentistry company. It's not what \u2013 it's kind of in the cards.","I think, what you \u2013 when you \u2013 Steve, when you look at the Google searches that have really rocketed for clear aligners over the last quarter or so, some heavy investing by SDC and also having invested by us, it's generating a lot of interest from a consumer standpoint in the marketplace. More and more, we know we have a strong consumer brand and we'll reach out the consumers who try to drive that.","But again, I want to emphasize, we're a doctor-directed kind of a product line. We work through our docs to get these things done and we do want to establish a strong brand identity with consumers as they turn into patients. At the same time, we don't have a direct-to-consumer kind of model that we're pushing at the moment. We got to exercise through SDC and our supply for those kinds of things. I hope \u2013 does that help, Steve? Does that make sense to you?","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's loud and clear. Thanks, Joe.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And I will congratulate on a quarter because it really was.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","The first question I just had on SmileDirectClub, in the past, we've heard some discussion from orthodontists little nervous what this might mean for their practice. I'm just wondering, can you update us on where the conversations have been at the respective conferences you've attended so far? Clearly, some of the initiatives you have in place from a advertising standpoint, they must be drawing in new patients. So I'm assuming orthodontists are getting comfortable that it's not going to cannibalize their business. But any update there? And then I have a follow-up.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, Rich, I'd say, we announced July last year the SDC relationship that we have. This caused a lot of turmoil in the industry in a sense of what we did and why we did. We continue to explain to our customer base in the sense of a logic behind that. Their business continues to expand and the market continues to expand.","So I think there \u2013 I can't tell you that this will ever go away. There's still I would quantify is a large amount of anxiety in the marketplace. I don't think that will change. What I do find though, Rich, is that customers that do a significant amount in Invisalign and have a good relationship with Align tend to understand this more or accept it more.","Once it happens and once its stay more in the metals and brackets, I think it'd been more voice for us or more concern than some of our \u2013 now that's empirical. I can't give you any statistics specifically on our customer based on that. But it's what I feel.","But I \u2013 overall, I think as time goes on and the orthodontic market continues to expand as well as the consumer market continues to expand, and the \u2013 I think it generates, as we said before, huge amount of business goes for the GPs and the orthos that use Invisalign and we'll continue to recycle patients that don't fit the protocols that SDC has into the current customer base that we have.","So I just say we have to keep working it, Rich. If we're not out of the woods in the sense of discomfort of our customers. But we'll keep driving the same message, we'll keep bringing business into those accounts, to help those accounts grow and hopefully they'll reach a high comfort level over time.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up. On the distributor acquisitions you're doing internationally. Wondering if you could just quantify the contribution that you saw in the quarter and what we should think going forward? And also, are there additional ones we should expect in future quarters aside from the ones you executed in 1Q and if you could talk to the gross margin impact as well?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take that one, Rich, this is John. The impact is very, very small when we get closed those deals in the first quarter, so there's really not much of a material effect that we saw. But it is in line with our overall strategy where we want to be able to have our own sales team, go to \u2013 work in those markets and try to grow faster. So it continues and it's part of our strategy, but there really is a really small factor to start in the first quarter. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks and good afternoon. I'll also congratulate you guys on a pretty strong results.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the average selling price numbers look pretty solid and probably reflects at least \u2013 the other price increase you took several months ago. But just on pricing in the market, and we did notice that ClearCorrect announced the shift in their pricing at AAO over the weekend where now practitioners can pay per aligner.","This probably only has impact maybe on the low-end of the market, but just curious if you have any thoughts about their pricing change that whether it really matters for Align overall? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. I think, I mean I saw that too. It's pretty well presented by ClearCorrect. I think if you have kind of product that they have, that's a pretty simple way to go to marketplace.","And so we don't see that changing our strategy because when you look at the sophistication of our product line and how it is directed towards certain malocclusions and the number aligners associated with it, our pricing makes sense in that way. But if you're ClearCorrect, I'd say that that was a simple way to go about it. And I think it makes sense in that into the marketplace.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Steve. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll limit myself to two questions. First one is just international. I mean big, big numbers, diverse growth. EMEA was up 38%, Joe, a big acceleration from the 4Q 2016 number of up 20%. And I know 4Q 2016 had some sort of EMEA backlog moving parts, if you would. So just maybe your thoughts on how that market is growing? Is the best to look at it \u2013 I guess what I'm asking is somewhere in between that 20% deceleration that we saw exiting 2016 and the big 38% number that you put up them in 1Q 2017?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Jon, that's a great question. They came back very strong in that sense. I would say that in this case, we continue to do incredibly well in Spain. You see us in the U.K., both from a GP standpoint, orthodontics standpoint continues to grow and we're seeing great strength out of Germany also, France. So by country, when I look at that and again I've spent a lot of years over in Europe too, all those countries are so different when you see that kind of acceleration and growth across each one of those countries, the team is executing well on the strategy across all the different cultures.","I honestly would say it's hard to explain exactly what happened in the fourth quarter in EMEA. I would tell you that internally, we probably did not guess the vacation schedule as well as what happened in Europe. And we had some bleed over, obviously, from a case shipment standpoint.","And I'd say in general, we as a company, we haven't anticipated well the turndown in the holidays in Europe and how that can affect case growth. So I think behind your question, Jon, there's \u2013 we're executing well over there, we're excited about it. Obviously, this expansion that we've done in the Middle East and Russia with this next distributor acquisition is something we know how to do. We've proven we really can grow from that. I'm confident we can continue to drive some pretty impressive numbers out of Europe as the team continues to execute there.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, very helpful. And then the other one just specific to SDC, it seems the cases that you guys are providing them are still in sort of infancy stage. But Joe, I'd love your thoughts on how that \u2013 you came into the agreement nine months ago or so. How that doctor-directed at-home market has progressed? And rather than cannibalizing a ton of Align cases, I guess what I'm trying to figure out, is there a component of this where you have another player out there talking about clear aligners, spending marketing dollars. Is that helping to sort of stimulate the entire market, which could be a precursor for what happens when some of the other big ortho companies, if they do come out with their clear aligner products? Thanks guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes, Jon, I'd say we think that this is helping to stimulate the whole clear aligner category. SDCs, they spend a lot of money, they're very good in a sense of how they advertise. We see that as we go to marketplace too. So I do think that's a component in the growth of the marketplace right now. I'd also caution you, Jon, as the other clear aligner companies come in, I don't expect big consumer spend. These are companies that you normally just sell to orthodontists through their channels or through distribution channels. They're not used to massive consumer advertising campaigns and the associated \u2013 expense associated with that.","So I'm not so sure that the next list of competitors, and you can reel them off as much as I can, are going to come into the marketplace with that kind of gunpowder to go directly to consumer. I don't think the SDC and our model will be broadly duplicated with the next round of competition.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Let me ask maybe two revenue questions, and then I have a margin question as well. But Joe, on the revenue, the guidance you're giving for second quarter and then for the full year, it would seem to imply a slowdown in the second half to maybe 20% revenue growth. And given the strength this quarter, that's almost hard to imagine, which just a couple of quarters ago, that would've been a good number. And so just trying to figure out if there's just conservatism in there? What kind of \u2013 how you're thinking about the second half playing out?","And then on the international side, for a long time, we've kind of heard the story that you need to continue to invest in the international markets to really kind of sustain 30% growth. You tick up to 40% this quarter, is that kind of \u2013 should we be thinking about sustainability now above 30% in the international markets at least in the near-term?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay, Jeff. This is John. I'll take the question. On revenue, what we've seen in the first half is you saw great performance in the first quarter. We continue to see that as we head into the second quarter. Strong performance and we're guiding to the high side of what we had in our long-term model of case shipments on our high side of 27%.","Our strategies are playing out. We're seeing that in what we've seen in volume and that's why we felt comfortable of taking this to the high-end of our guidance to closer to the 25% for the year. And as we get through this quarter and the second quarter, we'll revisit that if the volume continues to where we see it. So right now, it's not being conservative. We're just kind of calling what we see. And then in terms of the growth that you saw \u2013 that you were talking about, was this specifically for international or are you \u2013 was it...","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","EMEA or APAC or...","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Pretty much just rolling the international up all together, we've kind of long thought of that as the sustainable 30% or 25% to 30% and you have to keep investing to maintain that kind of number. Now we see it up to 40%. Just wondering how sustainable is that here going forward?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I mean so we definitely still have volume opportunities in these developing countries. So that is growth opportunities for us. We've mentioned on our earlier part of this call about some of the distributor deals and some of the things that we're going direct. That should help us with some of the volume. But we're still seeing a lot of growth and a lot of opportunities in places like China and parts of EMEA and so on. And we're going to continue to push for that growth where we can and we expect it to continue to keep growing like it has.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough. And then just on the margin side. A couple of quarters here where margins have been down. Your guiding, for the full year, obviously, flat to up slightly, so many initiatives going on at this point that's really helping support that top line. I guess, what gives you the confidence? And where does the margin improvement come from I guess, going forward with all this investment that you've got going on at this point?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, what we've seen, Jeff, so far is we've invested as we have really last year and now into this year upfront with a lot of our sales initiatives, some of our marketing expenses upfront. We're seeing that volume come through and that's happened in the first quarter and expected to continue into the year. And that's what gives us confidence in holding our margin rate flat to slightly up from last year.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Jeff. See you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Please pardon any mispronunciation. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I think that's me. You mentioned the ERP process is driving that DSO number higher. You say it's kind of a several quarter phenomena, but can you give us any granularity around that? It's getting to be a larger number. So when is a reasonable timeframe to see that number turn over and see the cash start to improve?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, Robert. It's something that we've worked hard within the companies to try to improve. It's not \u2013 the big ERP implementation we had was last July. But we've also been putting on additional entities and going live on our new ERP. And that has caused us to struggle a little bit in terms of getting some of those collections and moving from one system to another, getting customers and our collectors to kind of be in sync.","We expect that it's going to start to come down as we go through this year. And some of the initiatives that we have that to be able to really focus on those collections and also work on our ERP to make sure that we're able to fix some of these issues that we have. But we expect it to start coming down.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And there's no bad debt experience of consequence?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Now what we've seen is as we've tested and has gone through, it's taking longer for us to collect but it's not turned into bad debt. It's just a slower pain that we normally experience. But the bad debt has not increased.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Rob. One last question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good afternoon. Not to disparage the results at all, but I'm curious if the North American GP experience in the first quarter was in line or maybe better than your plan? It seems that it was more in line I suppose with typical seasonality whereas we saw the rest of the business really pick up in the first quarter versus historical trend, curious on your thoughts there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hi, Brandon, it's Joe. I'd say it's in line to trending up. Maybe slightly stronger than what we thought. I'd say it straight and probably came from like we mentioned DSOs more than anything. And I work with them. So we thought good about the quarter in that sense. And they're not dramatic, but let's say trending up.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","If you can, one more. Curious if you have any data or if you even track this in terms of like the new iTero shipments. Last year was a big year in terms of how many of those go to non-Invisalign docs? And kind of what the uptake trajectory or trend might be from doc to get one of the new scanners sort of translating those into pull through for new case starts?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","That's always kind of a magic question around the table here is \u2013 we do know that we do see an uptick and uses of Invisalign when we sell Invisalign and account. Usually, that account has already been associated with Invisalign in some way, Brandon. So, but we haven't been able to quantify that. Sometimes, it's a blip, sometimes it's bigger. Sometimes it tends to kind of fall back down to the initial line as an Invisalign customer some point.","But we certainly know that once your customer does get an Invisalign scanner, they tend to do more Invisalign cases. And frankly, we can bring more power to that customer in the sense of the software and the ease of the use of the product line that we really start to build in with the iTero scanner. As far as how many we sell to non-Invisalign accounts, I really don't have that data and I don't think we've kept track of that data at all.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question, please?","Operator","Not a problem. Our last question will come from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks very much. Joe, given the nice uptick in growth, what is your sense about the underlying market on the ortho side? Are your customers reporting any changes in their sort of typical case start growth or is this all share gains on your part?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I mean we're seeing an increase of orthodontic patients through the orthodontists that we track and we talk to, John. So we do have a healthy orthodontic market behind us. There's no doubt.","I think our team expansion shows that we have taken significant share in that area too. So look, it's wonderful to have a good \u2013 a stronger market behind you like that, but this is a story of a strong market and a share shipped at the same time.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And what are your views as the underlying market growth? We'd sort of put it maybe at about 4% on a unit basis. Would that be in sync with what you hear from your customers?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes, right on.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then one other one, the very good growth in DSOs, I assume that's primarily in North America. Can you just talk a little bit about what your strategy has been to drive that? Or has it really been just as those entities get bigger, they viewed Invisalign as a good same-store growth driver? Just curious what you're seeing?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Look, it kind of \u2013 John, you led the question really well, I mean it's kind of a story at a DSO level. As soon as you join the DSO, it's all about growth, right. And we're trying to transfer best practices on growth and efficiency across all the different units that they have.","Invisalign is a great story because you can attract more patients with Invisalign, you have a different revenue source and you tend those patients to attract with Invisalign. You tend to keep them over time, too. And so, we incentivize these customers, we train them as much as we possibly can, with more work to make it as easy to use Invisalign as possible. And it's worked out well.","Obviously, Heartland has been a good partner for us and several other DSOs that we have out there. And it's a good business partnership in that sense, but a lot of work we have to do to work together to get the right advertising in place, demographics from a patient identification standpoint, the training is necessary for each one of those. DSOs can really help to facilitate that based on a kind of organization that they are.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference.

Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights for the third quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and intra-oral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","For Q3, I'm pleased to report revenues, volumes and earnings above our third quarter outlook, driven by better-than-expected volume across the Invisalign portfolio in Asia Pacific and Latin America, reflecting record highs for both regions and improving trends in the North American orthodontics channel. Notwithstanding EMEA summer seasonality, we saw continued adoption from teens and especially young patients using Invisalign First across the board. Q3 Invisalign volumes were up 20.7% year-over-year, driven by the growth across the product portfolio as well as the expansion of our customer base, which increased by 5,900 new Invisalign doctors for a total of 63,000 active doctors worldwide. The iTero scanner and services business was up 16.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth across each region, and down sequentially as expected coming off a record second quarter. ","Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, typical Q3 summer seasonality for adult case starts in North America was offset by the growth in North American teen market as well as the strength from Latin American orthodontists. Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year on tough comps. Recall in Q3 '18, we had a teen and adult promotion that drove approximately 4 to 5 points of growth in the Americas. In Q3, we trained over 2,700 new doctors in the Americas region, of which nearly half were Latin American doctors. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volume growth reflects increased utilization for the Americas region overall, driven by the North American Orthos at 19.1 cases per doctor, where we saw improved momentum throughout the quarter and good growth from teens in Invisalign First patients. North American GP volume was seasonally lower in Q3, and we're seeing improving trends into fourth quarter, reflecting benefit from our investment in sales resources added at the beginning of the year. New and existing reps are continuing to ramp up, and we would expect further progress over the remainder of the year.","We also had continued strength across comprehensive and non-comprehensive products in Latin America, led by Brazil. Year-over-year, Q3 Invisalign volume for the Americas region was driven by continued growth from both the Ortho and GP channels, including the DSOs. The DSO channel remains an important channel and consistently grows faster than non-DSO practices. ","For our international business, Q3 reflects increased growth in Asia Pacific, especially from our teen segment in China, partially offset by sequentially lower volume in EMEA due to the summer holidays for Invisalign practices in most European countries. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign volume increased 32.1%, reflecting strength across our product portfolio with continued expansion of our customer base. In Q3, we changed -- we trained over 3,100 new Invisalign doctors internationally, with 60% in the Asia Pacific region. In EMEA, Q3 Invisalign volumes were down sequentially as expected, reflecting more pronounced seasonality in the first half of the quarter and strong momentum in the back half, led by Iberia in the U.K. Q3 volumes were up 29% year-over-year with broad-based growth across the Invisalign product portfolio and continued momentum from Invisalign Go treatment. ","We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. In Q3, as part of our corporate structure reorganization, we reallocated order acquisition for EMEA from the Netherlands to Poland. This site will serve as a centralized facility for order acquisition, local sales and support. In addition, this location will also offer treatment planning to support all of EMEA country markets except for Spain and Germany, where we'll continue to support their local markets. ","For APAC, Q3 Invisalign volume increased 35.1% year-over-year, led by Greater China and Japan. We continue to see strong growth from GP dentist, which was up 53.2% year-over-year, especially in Japan, where adoption of Invisalign Go continues to exceed expectations. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volume for APAC reflects continued momentum in China, especially from teen cases and growth from Taiwan and Korea. We also saw increased adoption of Invisalign First in Japan and ANZ and Taiwan as well as positive results from Teen Edge professional marketing programs, which are helping to drive Invisalign growth. ","During the quarter, we opened the treatment planning facility in Yokohama, Japan, to better support Japanese doctors in local language and local time zones. APAC remains a huge growth opportunity for Align, and this investment reflects our commitment providing our customers with continued support as we grow and scale our business across the region. ","Teens and kids continue to make up the largest portion of the orthodontic market and represent a huge growth opportunity for Invisalign treatment to replace metal braces worldwide. Over the past 2 years, we introduced 2 product innovations to help doctors treat more patients in this segment. Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement addresses roughly 45% of teen cases and is the only clear aligner to move the mandible forward while straightening teeth at the same time. Invisalign First treatment is the first clear aligner product designed with features specifically for growing patients as young as 7 years old, and Phase 1 addresses 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year. Both products have continued to grow and helped increase utilization for Invisalign treatment worldwide. ","In Q3, 130,000 teenagers and kids as young as 7 years old started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 31.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption across all major regions, especially China. Cumulatively, nearly 2 million teens or younger patients have used Invisalign clear aligners. ","In Q3, we continue to see strong dental engagement with consumers, reaching over 4.5 million unique visitors on Invisalign websites worldwide for a total of 62 million visitors to date. Our digital approach to teen marketing continues to drive awareness and interested teenagers into Invisalign practices. Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q3 quarterly slides. ","In addition, we launched a new advertising campaign for North America at the beginning of the quarter. The North American campaign was launched across all key media channels with a reach to over 140 million consumers, combining a robust paid media strategy across prime broadcast, cable and connected TV channels with paid search and social media. While still new in the marketplace and very early in the cycle, we're seeing a positive response from doctors and consumers. In the last few weeks, all KPIs metrics have shown strong momentum with more than a 50% increase in Doctor Locator searches and in leads scheduled from our Smile Concierge service. ","Finally, as many of you may have seen, we recently announced marketing relationships with several professional sports teens, including the San Francisco 49ers, the Toronto Raptors, the Carolina Hurricanes and the New England Patriots. Align is always looking for ways to evolve our brand marketing to be relevant to potential patients where they work, live and play. ","Over the last few years, many sports brands have evolved their own brand programs to engage with fans in a variety of ways and through multiple touch points. Partnering with teens who have an omni-channel approach to brand marketing and engagement gives us direct access to large, loyal fan bases and helps us reach individual consumers and whole families through a variety of existing fan platforms. With the right team partners, we can create awareness for the power of winning smiles. And as always, the goal is the same for us: to build awareness and demand for Invisalign treatment and connect engaged consumers with Invisalign doctor practices in their markets. ","For Q3, iTero scanner and services revenue was down sequentially as expected and up 16.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth across all regions and customer channels, including large DSOs. Year-to-date, iTero revenues were up 47.3%, reflecting continued adoption of digital dentistry. Cumulatively, over 18 million orthodontic scans and 4.3 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Heartland Dental, one of our largest DSO partners, recently celebrated their millionth iTero scan, highlighting how important iTero and Invisalign workflow is in their doctor practices, which now includes 900 offices across the U.S. and is enabling them to add nearly 200,000 digital scans per month. ","Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased from 78.7% to 71.9% in Q3 of last year. International scans increased 62.5%, up from 53.9% in the same quarter last year. Within the Americas, 92.9% of cases submitted by North American orthos were submitted digitally. We continue to expand the iTero portfolio to address doctors' needs and enable them to more easily adopt Invisalign treatment in their practices. ","In August, we announced the commercial availability of the iTero Element 2 scanner in China, with the first made in China iTero Element 2 produced in our manufacturing facility in Ziyang. The launch exemplifies Align's continued innovation and investment to advance digital dentistry in China. ","In September, we announced a global distribution agreement for the iTero Element family of intraoral scanners with Zimmer Biomet Dental. The agreement enables us to leverage Zimmer Biomet Dental's extensive direct global sales force and network of dental clinicians and laboratories to help to further drive the penetration of iTero scanners and services in their growing digital restorative market. The collaboration also offers Zimmer Biomet Dental customers access to Invisalign clear aligners through the iTero platform to facilitate a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment approach. We know that a key differentiator in the evolution to a digital practice and dental ecosystem is clinical education. Through this collaboration, the iTero scanner becomes the exclusive intraoral scanner used in the U.S. and European Zimmer Biomet Institutes, which trains thousands of doctors annually in an interactive learning environment, with the ultimate goal of improved clinical outcomes. We also joined Zimmer at the Japan Society of Oral Implantology Meeting in Japan and at the EAO in Portugal, where the iTero intraoral scanners were showcased. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Morici","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $607.3 million, up 1.1% from the prior quarter and up 20.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. For clear aligners, Q3 revenue of $516.3 million was up sequentially due to Invisalign volume growth in most geographies and higher ASPs. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 20.9% reflects strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and higher ASPs. Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $30 to $1,260, primarily due to price increases in all regions, partially offset by promotional discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up $30, primarily reflecting price increases in all regions, partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. ","Total Q3 Invisalign shipments of 384 point -- 385,400 cases were up 2.2% sequentially and up 20.7% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.6% sequentially and up 16.4% year-over-year. For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 4.1% sequentially and up 7.4% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 2.5% sequentially and up 32.1% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the third quarter was $91.1 million, down 12.4% sequentially as expected, reflecting lower volume coming off another strong Q2, partially offset by higher ASPs. Year-over-year, scanners and services revenue was up 16.5%, driven by increased services revenue off of a higher installed base and higher volume. ","Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 72%, flat sequentially and down 1.6 points year-over-year. Gross margin was impacted by approximately 0.3 points year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 73.5%, down 0.2 points sequentially, primarily due to increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher ASPs and seasonally lower doctor training. Clear aligner gross margin was down 1.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 64.1%, up 0.5 points sequentially and up 0.2 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies. ","Q3 operating expenses were $310.4 million, up sequentially 21.3% and up 25.9% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflects the benefit of $51 million related to the Straumann litigation settlement recorded in the second quarter. Additionally, the third quarter includes a $6.8 million benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases. The year-over-year increase reflects our investment in consumer advertising with a brand-new North American campaign launched in August, continued -- and the continued investment in R&D, geographic expansion and go-to-market activities, partially offset by the benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases. ","Our third quarter operating income of $127.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 20.9%, down 8.5 points sequentially and down 3.9 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to the $51 million benefit related to the Straumann settlement recorded in Q2, partially offset by a $6.8 million benefit related to the Invisalign store lease terminations in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin, as described earlier, and the increased investments in our geographic expansion and go-to-market activities, partially offset by the benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases in the third quarter. ","Operating margin was impacted by approximately 0.6 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable foreign exchange. Interest, other income and expense for the third quarter was $1.3 million, down $16.1 million sequentially and flat on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decrease reflects the $15.8 million gain related to the sale of our equity investment in SmileDirectClub during the second quarter. ","With regards to third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 20.2%. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.28, down $0.55 sequentially and up $0.04 compared to the prior year. ","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $782.4 million, an increase of $16.5 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by $200 million used to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our stock. Of our $782.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $513.9 million was held in the U.S. and $268.5 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $531.8 million, up approximately 2.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 79 days, up 2 days sequentially and up 4 days from Q3 last year. ","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $234.5 million, up $138.3 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $26.6 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the third quarter defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $207.9 million. ","During Q3 2019, we entered into and completed an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, ASR, to repurchase $200 million of our common stock, which was completed in September of 2019. We received a total of approximately 1.1 million shares for an average price of $176.61 per share. We have $200.5 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program. ","With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter, and momentum has continued to build into Q4, across all regions. For international, we expect Q4 volumes across to be up sequentially, reflecting strong uptick from EMEA, as doctors come back from summer holidays. For the Americas, we expect Q4 volumes to be up sequentially, reflecting growth across all key country markets as well as momentum in North American Ortho and GPs along with increased media spend and the launch of our new consumer advertising campaign, as Joe described earlier. ","We expect our iTero business to be up sequentially in Q4 to reflect end of the year capital equipment purchases and investment in growing the iTero business across all regions. ","With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 400,000 to 407,000 cases, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our Q4 revenue outlook assumes no SDC volume compared to the same quarter a year ago when aligner supply to SDC contributed about $5.8 million to revenue. We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 71.7% to 72.4%. Q4 gross margin is up 0.4 points compared to Q3 as we expect continued improvements in our manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher volumes. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $318 million to $323 million. Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 22% to 22.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately $79.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42. In addition, we expect to repurchase at least $100 million of our stock in the open market in Q4. ","As we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $30 million to $35 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $22 million to $24 million. ","Before turning the call back to Joe, I want to update you on our corporate entity reorganization. On January 1, 2020, our EMEA headquarters in the Netherlands will officially move to Switzerland. Our new Swiss location will serve as the headquarters for all regional, commercial and operational activities in EMEA and will be supported by the existing network of local offices established across the region. Our new corporate entity, Align Technology Switzerland GmbH, will assume all responsibility for the sale and distribution of the Invisalign system, iTero intraoral scanners and associated Align goods and services in EMEA, previously provided by Align Technology B.V. ","Our local and global teens have been working diligently to ensure a very smooth transition while supporting our doctors, suppliers and employees, many of whom have decided not to relocate to Switzerland but will stay on in transitional roles as needed. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in supporting this major company initiative. While it is never easy to make this kind of change, especially when it impacts team members who have helped build the EMEA business and have contributed so much to our overall success, we are very excited about our new operations in Switzerland. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe for closing comments.","Joseph Hogan","Thanks, John, and thanks for joining our call today. Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter for us across the board with increasing momentum in APAC and North America that has carried us over into Q4. As you can see from the high end of our guidance, the implied full year growth rate from Invisalign volume is 23.5%, with international growth in the mid to high 30s. .","Overall, our business remains very healthy with numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. We remain confident in both the enormous opportunity ahead to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers, and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally. ","With that, I want to thank you again for joining the call. I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming financial conferences and meetings, including the Invisalign GP Summit in November in Las Vegas. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Erin Wright","In terms of the higher OpEx spend, are you seeing the returns from the North America, I guess, stepped-up marketing and media spend as you expected? And how should we be thinking about that level of spend into the fourth quarter just based on the responses that you're seeing from the marketing campaigns so far? And will this, I guess, contribute to the accelerating kind of volume trends in the fourth quarter as well as momentum into 2020?","Joseph Hogan","Erin, it's Joe. Yes, we're seeing, as you can tell from the statistics we just recorded, we have a real large take-up when you think about doc locator searches, which is a primary or concierge service and what they're handling. Remember, the concierge service takes those customers and then directs them directly to doctors that we have a high degree of certainty that they'll actually convert them into Invisalign. ","As we move into the fourth quarter, expect the same amount of investment. Also in the Americas too with the improvements you're seeing is also our sales force and the additions we put together. As we said at the beginning of the year, it usually takes at least 9 months, 6 to 9 months, to see some kind of traction that we're seeing with the sales force, too. So both the advertisements from a North America standpoint and the added salespeople, we think, are really contributing to that momentum we just reported.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up, just on China, in particular. Can you speak to what you're seeing across that market, just given some of the commentary you had in the previous quarter around the softness in that geography? If you could give us an update there, that would be great.","Joseph Hogan","Well, the momentum we reported in China that we -- when we had our announcement in the second quarter, continued throughout the quarter. So I think we had 26% growth in China in the second quarter. As we move into the third quarter, we're in the upper 30% range. Overall, we're just seeing good uptake. We had a good teen season there. We've hired 40% more people in China also. It takes them a while to actually become acclimatized, be trained and have them effective in China also. So we feel good about the momentum in China. ","I think the economic situation there with reporting the slowest growth we've seen in 30 years, we know we have a headwind there because that continues, it reported in the second quarter, too. But overall, we think we've made the right adjustments and we have the right focus right now to continue some good growth there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Beuchaw","I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions about Invisalign and appropriately so, so I want to go a different direction and ask about a couple other things. One is actually the iTero number in the quarter. I know it's normal seasonally to see things make a move like this, but I wonder, as you saw trends for iTero in the quarter, where -- there was actually a lot going on operationally, given what you were doing with Zimmer, which I'm sure was a significant time investment for the sales force where you had a product launch coming in a key region. Do you think there was any disruption in terms of the commercial effort around iTero during the quarter?","John Morici","Steve, it's John. No, there's no disruption. I mean, we are -- if you look at iTero for -- on a year-to-date basis, it's up 47%. You're going to have some timing that happens by quarter, but we feel very good where iTero is. It's the front end of our digital ecosystem, very critical to our business, and you're going to have fluctuations by quarter. But we feel very good where iTero is so far this year.","Stephen Beuchaw","Okay. And then sorry, Joe, for leaving you out here, but I got a couple for John. One is on the transition in Europe, can you speak to how much duplicative costs you might be -- might have been carrying between the Switzerland operations and the Netherlands operations and what that could mean for the tax rate over time as you change the domicile of the organization. And then I wonder if you could give us an update on what you think prospectively the impact of facilities' manufacturing capacity utilization is going to be going forward on gross margins?","John Morici","Yes, Steve. In terms of the changes that we make and making in EMEA, it's really to simplify some of the organization that we have and in light of many of the tax changes and other structures that we had to create. So look at it from that standpoint. It simplifies things a little bit from an entity standpoint and gives us some flexibility to changes to our tax -- to taxes that happen globally. ","From a facility standpoint, we're putting in manufacturing where it makes sense. We've talked a lot about China manufacturing, and that continues to ramp up. Treatment planning globally would be closer to our customers. That's very important to us. And there's always a transition period in terms of that productivity, as they become more and more productive, but we feel very good about the investments that we've made and the gross margin that we see now and what we're forecasting.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Joe, what's your sense about the underlying health of consumer spending on orthodontics at this point? Is it getting better or worse? And I'm curious if you think the -- all the money going into some of the direct-to-consumer-oriented models like SDC, is that proving to be a net benefit to Align or a little bit of a detriment as you weigh sort of awareness versus any competitive shifts?","Joseph Hogan","John, first of all, I think you picked up in your survey and other people do too when we picked it up is, I mean, we see good consumer spending right now from an orthodontic standpoint. Align stands out in that spending when you look at it specifically. As far as how that's driven, obviously, we've put a lot more into consumer advertising, and some of the DTC competitors have done that also. I do think that, that raises consumer brand awareness. No question. I think the consumers go to the Internet to try to answer those questions. They'll go to their doctors to try to answer those questions, too. So I can't deny, John. I think that our advertising and some competitive advertising in that sense probably does raise all boats to a certain extent.","John Kreger","Great. And then one quick follow-up. The utilization among your North American GPs has been kind of flat over the last couple of years. What is your thinking about the best way to drive that higher over the next year or 2?","Joseph Hogan","First of all, John, I think you know that. You've been with us for a long time. We add so many GPs every year. 150,000 of them, we train significant numbers of them each year. And so you end up with a dilutive effect in that sense. So the numbers that we reported, it always is around 3.4% to 3.6% from quarter-to-quarter. But back to your question, I think the way to do this is: one, obviously, our DSO approach is a good one because as I talked about it being a force multiplier before you work with these strong DSOs, they have their own training for their groups. They help quantify workflow and do different things that for years in this business, I think we thought we just needed 1 product, but we've learned over time, like a product like iGo really isn't a product, it's a system. It's a system that really works with GPs to identify patients that qualify for this. It fits well with their workflow. It allows them to be confident when they're in front of patients that they can handle those cases, and we stand behind them. So overall, it's right products, right systems, working with DSOs that help us to become -- drive better penetration, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets.","Ravi Misra","Can hear me okay?","Shirley Stacy","Yes. Sure.","Ravi Misra","Great. So just a question on the gross margin, not to pick too much at what I think was a pretty good quarter, just why aren't we seeing, given the kind of pricing uptick that looks like it emerged in the third quarter, why aren't we seeing more of a flow-through on the clear aligner gross margin in the fourth quarter? And maybe if you could help us think about pricing in the fourth quarter for the ASPs. I think last quarter, you said it would be about even with the second quarter, and that's pretty much a lot better than that. So do you feel more confidence in your ability to take price here?","John Morici","Yes. Robbie, this is John. As we've discussed, I mean, we've taken price up in the third quarter, and you see that show up in ASPs. We're also investing to -- in our manufacturing and treatment plant to be closer to our customers. Sometimes that offsets -- and in third quarter, there was not much change from Q2. In Q4, we talked about our guidance, which is up sequentially in gross margin. It's a reflection of more volume productivity that we expect to continue to see at these manufacturing sites. And we'll continue to see that benefit. When you look at the ASPs, as you mentioned, like I said, at $1,260, was a good increase of $30 from Q2. We were able to -- when we think about the forecast to that, it will come down slightly. The mix was really high from a comprehensive standpoint in Q3. So when we take it down to Q4, it'll be, we think, closer to $1,245, which is very consistent that we've talked about as being essentially flat as we go through this year.","Ravi Misra","Great. And then if I can just maybe squeeze in a follow-up to the implications on teen there with the comprehensive, just if you could confirm or maybe provide some color. As that -- as you get deeper penetration at that market, it looks like you've been doing 30% growth here the last few quarters. How should we think about the mix shift on the pricing? That should be kind of a good guy, right, with the more comprehensive cases?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, Rob, it's Joe. Yes, you're right. It's a mix shift. Remember, from a teen growth standpoint, and we're reporting really good above 30% teen growth globally, but we're still the -- our utilization rates in that marketplace are way below our clinical entitlement, I would say. Today, we can handle almost all teen cases. So with that in mind, though, it is a mix-up. It is primarily a comprehensive marketplace. It's primarily an ortho marketplace in how it works. We feel really good about our portfolio to be able to address the teen patients right now. And long term, we see that as a counterbalance on ASPs that we all think about.","Operator","Next question is from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block","Joe, maybe first one for you. Just any comments, maybe I missed it, but sort of on comprehensive versus non-comprehensive growth this quarter. And then with the GP summit approaching next month, is there any plan to more aggressively sort of pursue call it this lower acuity cases through that channel? And then I've got a follow-up.","Joseph Hogan","Yes. I mean, Jon, honestly, I mean, from a comprehensive standpoint, obviously, still 70% of our portfolio more goes that way. But with the introduction of Lite, iGo, products like this, we made an adjustment on E5 this quarter, E7, all these other products. I mean that part of our product line has traditionally been growing faster and with the comprehensive thing is. Now it's a law of small numbers versus large numbers, but we do see increased growth in that area. ","When we look at the GP channel, we do look at the GP channel as a way to get at patients, what we call kind of a sub-acute kind of on a patient base to do that. So I mentioned iGo on the last call also as being a system that allows us to do that. Obviously, Lite does that also. So you'll see us, Jon, increasingly focused on that channel, but also think about working really closely with GPs on not just the product line, but the system itself with iTero, how to be able to do treatment planning quickly and to give the GPs confidence that when they adopt these cases, that they'll finish and they'll finish well. Those are the 3 critical variables we know we have to hit to really drive significant growth.","Jonathan Block","Got it. Very helpful. And then just maybe John, the reorg for this year, is there sort of a refined number? Is that 1.5% or 2%? Or is it still in that range? And then sort of part B to that question is it follows up on Ravi's. Just to be as specific as possible, the gross margin is in sort of flattish Q3 to Q4, is it a globalizing the supply chain headwind? Or is it more aligners per case headwind? And I'm asking that because the more aligners per case, that probably continues with teen, et cetera, but the globalizing supply chain, that seems more of a '19 event than a '20 event. So any more detail you can give around gross margin would be helpful.","John Morici","Yes, Jon, it's really both. I mean, when you look at, especially as we do and work with our doctors doing more and more complicated cases, as comprehensive grows and Invisalign First and teen and so on, those end up being more aligners and end up impacting our gross margin. The globalization that we're doing, that's much more short term. As we said, getting close to our customers is very, very critical to us. Treatment planning, manufacturing. But as you get more and more capacity there and scale that, you see productivity improvements.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.","Shirley Stacy","Kevin, you there?","Kevin Caliendo","Yes. Sorry, I apologize. Did you take the same price increases internationally as you did domestically? That's the first quick one. And then just looking at the trend, quarterly trend in case growth and overall revenue growth, is seasonality shifting as international sales grow as a percentage? And how should we think about that going forward?","Joseph Hogan","Kevin, Joe. On the pricing piece, yes, it's about the same. I think there's some mix and tucks on Lite versus comprehensive. But basically the same price increase globally across the board. On the revenue growth, the seasonality of it. I think the biggest thing that you can think of, there's really a couple of trends in this business is, one, in North America, you move into the third quarter, it's teen season and GPs tend to decline. But the biggest mix is in Europe, where you basically go down for vacation, I mean, lights go out for us for a long period of time, and then obviously come back in September. And then you got China on the other side that kind of compensates for that in the past. So those are the big, I would say, countercyclical or cyclical movements that we have in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","I have two, Joe. Just the first one. Just last quarter, you gave a little bit of color on anecdotally what you're seeing out in the field from doctor-directed competition and some of the discounting that might be taking place. I was just curious if you could comment on the -- on the trend into the current quarter and what you're seeing there? Anything that's surprising you or different from what you saw last quarter on those? And I have a follow-up.","Joseph Hogan","Richard, on the -- with that comment I made last quarter had to do with doctor-directed to DYI model and primarily North America and some kind of young adult segments. We actually saw that stabilize and actually start to improve in the third quarter from an order endpoint. So actually saw good momentum in the right direction there.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And I was just referring to the more traditional competitors that recently started launching products where there might be some trialing. That's what you're referring to as improving, not the DTC...","Joseph Hogan","No. Actually, I'd say both. I mean the traditional competitors that are out there, we acknowledged them last quarter, which we thought we had to, but there's no fundamental change in that, what we saw in the second quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And then just on China, Joe. I get the sense that you just have improved visibility relative to kind of where you were sitting at this time last conference call. Is that the right kind of directional takeaway from the call as you see the trends into the fourth quarter? Clearly, it picked up in China in the third quarter. And what would you say, your long-range plan top line greater than 20% growth for the foreseeable future. What would you say your confidence level is kind of today versus maybe 3 months ago, particularly with -- now that you have more data points in hand on China and some of those North America trend last quarter that were in focus.","Joseph Hogan","Rich, I'll keep my comments kind of in this year. But I'd say, what China shaped up to be is pretty much what we called in the second quarter. We said the teen season is going to come in China. We thought that would be a lift. We've hired the salespeople. We're looking for that to take hold and be able to move the business forward. And so to say we have better visibility, I think we have the same visibility that we had quarter-to-quarter. Actually, from an execution standpoint, I just think the steps that we've taken with some of the pressure on consumer demand that we reported in the second quarter, the operational steps that we took in China on the ground, we're seeing a good result for it and we feel good about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Maybe just a couple of housekeeping items. Joe, any update on the timing of the U.S. approval for the 5D scanner? And then any color you can share with us as far as mandibular uptake in the U.S.?","Joseph Hogan","Brandon, on the 5D scanner, the FDA is the FDA, and we feel confident we'll get through here. Early part of next year would be the -- my best forecast in that sense. I could tell you, from a 5D standpoint, the uptick around the world has been good. The carries detection piece to be able to see cracks or deterioration in teeth has been terrific. And so it's really been a changing aspect to the clinical GP practice to be able to see carries in a way that you really can't see them without a near infrared technology. So we're actually really excited about that. And we're excited to get it into North America.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Joe, I want to go back to China, just you did talk last quarter that you would lose that kind of teen tailwind as you go into the fourth quarter and next kind of normalizes that to some adult patients and all that. But it sounds like, as you've said on this call, you're starting to see some good traction with some of the sales force adds and other efforts in that area. So should we look at Q2 as kind of that 26% number that you brought up again this quarter from 2Q, is that kind of where our -- the baseline should be from here, and you think, at least going forward, somewhere in there or above, given some of these recent efforts?","Joseph Hogan","Jeff, obviously, we think we did well in the third quarter in China. Some of it was obviously the teen season. But actually, we had some pretty good adult growth, too. We're moving out of teen season there. As we talked about, the momentum going into the fourth quarter has been good there, too. As far as the baseline, Jeff, goes or whatever, hey, China is a growth market for us. We wouldn't be putting manufacturing in over there. We wouldn't be putting treatment planning, we wouldn't make the investments we're making, unless we feel that China is going to continue to be the second largest market that we're growing with. So I think that's the way you have to think about it going forward. What is it, Jeff?","Shirley Stacy","There you are. Hang on. Sorry, what did you say?","Jeffrey Johnson","I said Shirley has got a quick hook tonight. So thank you for keeping the on for a follow-up...","Shirley Stacy","Well, we're trying to get to as many analysts as we can, but go ahead.","Joseph Hogan","She's upset about that with [indiscernible]","Jeffrey Johnson","Well, as an Illinois fan, I won't comment on that. Joe, I do want to ask on the direct or kind of channel in the third quarter. Obviously, you've seen some states enact as your hurdles for some of those models and all that. I'm sure it's too early to see anything like that in your number or numbers. But I'd be interested, kind of what are you doing with your doctors to kind of try to combat some of that competition? Are you having any success in kind of helping these doctors understand where they need to be price point at? Is there other channel support you can provide? Just what are you doing to really kind of combat that direct-to-consumer angle?","Joseph Hogan","Jeff, first of all, when we think about things that you're talking about, having a doctor in the center of this thing, having an X-ray, you're moving teeth through bone, people think that -- I think majority of people or patients out there think that teeth just hang from gums. They don't actually understand that the teeth are boned in. And actually seeing what's going on in the bone is a pretty good indicator if you should go through orthodontic treatment or not. ","But with that said, with the GPs, I talked about in previous caller is the iGo product really is the best platform that we have right now in the sense of how to really educate doctors to go after these patients. And what I'm hearing more and more from GPs is they're having more and more of a dialogue with their patients. Their patients are coming in, they're asking questions now. They're saying, \"Hey, what does this mean? What can you do for me? What's your price point for being able to straighten my sixth anterior teeth?\" And we are trying to give them as many tools as we possibly can as far as workflow tools, which we have with iTero and iGo, and then products that they can really have a lot of confidence in. ","So I would say our initial push on that in United States has been improving significantly. You'll see it at the GP Summit, what we're rolling out and the kind of focus areas we have around that. But obviously, we'll have a very strong focus in that area, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.","Elizabeth Anderson","A lot of my questions at this point have been taken. But I just wanted to know if you could comment on the rise in inventory in the quarter? It seems like it just ticked up a little bit quarter-over-quarter but sort of has been rising year-over-year. And I just wanted to know if that was -- if there was something in what you guys were doing or something else behind that?","John Morici","Elizabeth, this is John. Really nothing out of the ordinary. When we look at the inventory, it's primarily on the iTero side. And it's really how we manufacture and much more level loading from a manufacturing standpoint. And really the rise that you saw in the third quarter is really anticipation of the volume that we expect in the fourth quarter. So that's all it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Andrew Stafford","This is Drew on for Matt, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to touch on consumer financing. I know you've talked about it a little bit in the past, and you're working through a third-party provider. Are you hearing any demand from customers asking for more options there? And would you have interest in expanding that program further?","John Morici","Yes, Drew, this is John. Of course, we want to do whatever we can to try to help turn those consumers into patients at a doctor. So financing is a piece of it. And we're working with companies, not just in the U.S. but other places as well, to try to remove some of that friction, give more options to those consumers, understand what the monthly payments are, how much down and so on. So there's a lot more that we can do there. We're making some progress, and you'll see new ways that we'll be coming to help, again, remove some of that friction for those consumers.","Andrew Stafford","Okay. And then just on the deal with Zimmer, maybe you could provide some thoughts on sort of why you chose them as a partner than maybe some of the geographies you'll be focusing on early on?","Joseph Hogan","Drew, it's Joe. On the Zimmer, we're really pleased to have them as partners. When you look at the history of that company from an implant standpoint, they're one of the leaders out there. They actually needed a digital front end, and that's what iTero really supply to them. ","When you look at our product line in conjunction with that, when you look at modern kind of treatments like that, implantology, is there's often a lot of space creation that has to take place in the sense of if a tooth is out of a mouth for a period of time, your teeth start to move over to fill that space. And more and more dentists do not want to remove enamel to put that implant in. So using aligners to be able to separate those teeth and allow an implant to be able to be a lot less invasive than it would be if you didn't account for that spacing. ","So overall, we're excited about it. I mean they're obviously strong all over the world. They complement us in so many places, including China. And so we're really excited about having a partnership, and we think we're starting off pretty well in the sense of the training and all that we reported.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays Bank.","Steven Valiquette","So not to beat China to death here, but when you talked about some of the things you did to improve results over there, whether it was on the investments in the GP, dentist, sales force, sales program centered on Invisalign Go or even just the increased consumer marketing spend, I guess, I'm curious if any one of these variables really stood out as the driver of the improvement? Or was it a little bit of everything. And then also, do you have any sort of high-level data points just on cases per doc in China on an absolute basis or even sort of relative to the rest of Align overall?","Joseph Hogan","Steve, on the variables of improvement, unfortunately, we're a multi-variable equation when you get to aligners. Things are sold in binary here. But I think you do add a point to the two big ones, which would be just an increase in consumer focus and then the sales force that we put in place. That's -- our GP effort, we're just really moving into that, too, and we're arranging that properly also. But those efforts, we think, are contributing also. But I'd say it's a mix of those 3 variables. I can't weigh them for you, really.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. What about the cases per doc in China? Any color on that?","Joseph Hogan","No, we don't want to give any color on that one. Right now, it's just -- I'd say you have to look at it as we're driving penetration there, and we're training a lot of doctors as we ramp up in China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Just two quick ones here. First, on ASPs. I think guidance would put you at something like $1,250 for the year. Do you think you can kind of maintain that level of ASP going forward? And can you kind of just talk through what kind of the key factors would be as we think about ASPs going forward? And then just a very quick follow-up. John, just wondering if there was any catch-up benefit to cases in the quarter, kind of post that ClinCheck disruption that you highlighted in 2Q.","John Morici","Well, I'll start with that one first because there was really no catch up or no benefit from that. As we had said in the second quarter call, it's really de minimis. There wasn't much of an effect that hit -- that affected the quarter. So there really wasn't an impact in the third quarter. ","In terms of ASPs, there's going to be puts and takes. And we've talked a number of times about what those puts and takes are. As we grow in comprehensive, like we had a strong comprehensive quarter in the third quarter, ASPs are higher, growing internationally, generally at a higher ASP. ","But then you also have significant growth in the low stage, and that can affect the mix as well. So what we've said all year, and as we look at things, we thought it would be relatively consistent. The puts and takes would kind of offset. Notwithstanding any FX changes, we thought the puts and takes would offset. And we saw that in the third quarter and we are guiding that in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.","Michael Ryskin","I'll try to be brief. First, just one quick follow-on on the ASP. Obviously, really nice improvement in the third quarter. I was wondering if you've got any -- I realize it doesn't show up in the numbers, but maybe you've got some qualitative pushback or feedback from docs on the price increase, sort of what was the response there? Because this was the biggest quarter-over-quarter move in quite some time. And also maybe if you saw some divergence in results from some of your highest utilization docs that are getting the advantaged discounts that can absorb it versus some of the lower-tier docs that are paying more close to the full price and, therefore, maybe weighing some of the other doctor-directed options?","Joseph Hogan","Michael, it's Joe. On the ASP piece, obviously, we raised price. John talked about it, some of the exchange aspect, whatever. But I think one thing I want the analysts who follow us to remember, like we said before, ASPs will fluctuate. But sometimes, our ASP is going down meaning our gross margins go up. Our lower-end products actually have a higher gross margin than our comprehensive product line. I know it's counterintuitive, but that's actually how it works. ","So I mean, I think, keep that in mind going forward. If you see some of that lumpiness from an ASP standpoint start heading down, don't take as a trajectory for lower gross margin. It's just those 2 are separate that way. And John, do you want to add anything on your end?","John Morici","And so like we said, you're going to have some offsets, but we're trying to grow from a -- all the way from low stage, the more simple cases, all the way to the complicated cases. And we believe in those traditional orthodontic case starts that we have product that can help move teeth, but the market expansion and some of that market expansion is going to be at those lower-stage products that are at a lower ASP, but we look at that as incremental business for us.","Michael Ryskin","And on the -- quick follow-up on the EMEA headquarters move you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting some turnover in personnel. Any expectation for disruption to the business in early 2020, sort of how are you bracing for that? How are you preparing and just to make sure that it's a smooth transition going into January next year?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, it's Joe again. Look, what we did in EMEA, which was fortuitous in a sense, about 3 years ago, we began to decentralize. We had a really big headquarters staff out of the Netherlands. It dictated a lot of what the regions did and had to do that because it's a relatively small business back then, and we needed to keep specialization at headquarters. ","Over the last three years, we really moved that out into the countries, moved it into France and Spain and Germany and different areas. And so we really embedded in those countries some real talent that I feel has good continuity will take them through. Now there's some overall headquarters talent that we don't want to lose that we're working hard to save, but I don't see it being a big, big disruptor for the business at all.","John Morici","And this has been something that -- Mike, this has been going on all year. We have a complete transition plan, very clear as to who's moving and how things are happening so that come January 1, it's very clear. So it's something that, as we've talked about on these calls since the beginning of the year, we've talked about this move and we feel really good about the plan that we have now and be able to hit the ground running in 2020.","Shirley Stacy","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure for me to be here today reporting my first quarter with Align.","On our call today, I will provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments; Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner & Services. Dave will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter.","Our second quarter results were good driven by strong Invisalign case volume up 10.5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year with growth across all customer channels and geographies.","North America volumes grew 17% year-over-year and our international geographies were up 30% compared to last year. Revenue was near the high-end of our guidance reflecting better than expected volumes offset somewhat by lower ASPs. On a constant currency basis total Q2 revenues were up 14.2% year-over-year and Clear Aligner revenues were up 17.5% year-over-year.","In North America, Invisalign volume is driven by growth on both ortho and GP customers. We had another record quarter for North American ortho. Utilization was an increase to 9.5 cases per doctor. North American GP dentist utilization grew slightly to 3 cases per doctor in conjunction with the significant increase in the base of our GP dentist customers. We trained about 1000 doctors during Q2, one of our highest training quarters ever and have more active GPs than ever.","I will share a few highlights for North America. We are continuing to implement our sales expansion program and are making progress. Our new approach to customer segmentation and partnering with our customers, practices has been received very positively by our doctors including the addition of our strategic account manager role for a high volume and multi-office customers.","The increase in sales reps has increased doctor touch points in both numbers and frequency. Our Invisalign Express 5 promotion was well-received by customers and resulted in a better than expected uptake in volume and mix shift to entry level product this quarter. In Q3, we adjusted the E5 promotions to support the launch of our new single arch Aligners offering.","Invisalign volumes for international doctors continue to be strong for both EMEA and Asia Pacific reflecting ongoing adoption and expansion of our customer base. We had record volume in most every major country in Europe as well as China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.","A few highlights from EMEA, 27% year-over-year shipment growth driven by continued strong growth in Spain, France, U.K. and Italy. Our performance has been driven by a significant increase in utilization up 1.6 cases per doctor following the recent launches of Invisalign G5 and G6 as well as ClinCheck Pro. We continue to benefit strongly from our focus sales approach in each of our markets as well as from our newly integrated markets in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, which are showing very good growth.","A few highlights for Asia Pacific, 39% year-over-year shipment growth driven by China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Taiwan, which is now a direct sales country for us. We ran a very successful Invisalign form in China with over 400 doctors from the private sector supporting our drive for broader penetration of the market. China is now our largest Invisalign market in Asia Pacific.","In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases in Q2 increased 18% year-over-year reflecting a good start to the teen orthodontic season. We are looking forward to a busy summer especially in the North American ortho channel where teenage cases were up 22% year-over-year in Q2.","Product innovation aims to create greater doctor preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to help doctors treat more patients and more complex cases with Invisalign.","We continue to make progress with the launch of our Invisalign G6 that's our solution for the First Premolar Extraction cases. Early signs are very promising around adoption of Invisalign G6, which is very important for the complex treatment needs in Asia and ClinCheck Pro, which has now been adopted by over 60% of our customers since its launch earlier this year.","In Q2, our Scanner & Services business revenues were down sequentially as expected given the launch. Not yet available our next generation iTero Element scanner, interest and demand for our new scanner has been very strong and we expect upcoming availability in shipping of the scanner in Q3 to help resume top-line growth.","We first previewed the iTero Element at the IDS show in Germany this past March. Then at the AAO in San Francisco in May and at our recent Invisalign GP summit in Las Vegas earlier this month. I have seen the iTero Element in action and the enthusiasm from our customers piloting is contagious.","Let me give you an example of how different the scanner is. At the GP summit, we had a scanning competition among practice stuff where they competed for the fastest scan time. The winning time was 2 minutes and 16 seconds and all finalists were under 3 minutes that's a big game changer in terms of efficiency of a patient appointment in the practice. Immediately after the contest was over doctors placed orders for 35 scanners in total this summer, we took orders from more than 100 new iTero Element scanners all attendees left the summit with a clear vision of what the future of iTero Element can offer and highly motivated about what it can do in their practice.","For Q2, total orders for iTero Element were about 700 scanners, 2x higher than total scanner orders a year ago. While this is my first Invisalign summit, our broader team and many of our attendees have remarked that it was the best GP summit ever in terms of doctor participation, energy, excitement and commitment to do more.","Many doctors expressed the recognition of our North American go-to-market changes with a number of sales reps and the quality of the call and they also recognized recent improvements to customer experience. Our teen message of Invisalign its everyday dentistry really resonated with them and they are beginning to see beyond just straightening teeth with the continuum of oral care and patient health with us.","Consumer interest in Invisalign brand continue to be strong in Q2 with over 1.3 million unique visitors to Invisalign.com doctor locators searches were up 26% year-over-year. And consumer request for more information up 27% year-over-year in North America. We also saw increased awareness with over 534,000 people visiting EMEA Web sites in Q2 and 157,000 of them searching for an Invisalign provider and 3x growth in the Invisalign social media community over the last year and a half.","Before I turn it over to David, I would like to share some of my initial observations and areas of focus over the next few months. I expect the past six out of eight weeks visiting our key locations in North America, EMEA and Israel. And I feel like I'm ramping up pretty quickly. The changes in our North American sales organization were absolutely needed. I like to relate that resources have been aligned and how we have sub-segmented the ortho and GP customers. In the second half, we will build out our North American team even further with the addition of an inside sales program to further support customers particularly newly trained and lower volume doctors.","Invisalign is not just a simple piece of plastic, I can't stress that enough. Our stereolithography manufacturing process which creates 150,000 aligners each day, each one being unique along with our treatment planning technology represents one of the most automated processes I have ever seen. Together these capabilities deliver very compelling treatment planning and manufacturing process that predictively moves teeth.","Align has build a huge amount of accumulated know-how and IP that make me feel very confident of our competitive position going forward. International has experienced more direct competition in certain markets in North America. We have proven, we can be effective in diverse markets and maintain ASPs net of foreign exchange. I'm impressed with our company and the progress we continue to make globally, international growth and expansion has been tremendous and is the biggest opportunity for us as we go forward. For that reason today we're now seeing changes to better support regional growth and priorities and to extend best practices across the company.","Raphael Pascaud has done a terrific job leading the international organization and has delivered geographic expansion, adoption and best practice across EMEA and APAC. He is now going to focus his attention and skills on our global marketing and business development efforts. With this change all three sales regions, North America, EMEA and APAC will now report directly to me. My experience tells me that this is the best way to stay in touch with the pulse of the business and to provide the inside direction each region needs to continue to grow.","Finally, a focus on customers is not new to Align, or to most global companies, most successful organizations have recognized the strategic value by having a customer centric focus has on growth and value creation. One of the key metrics used for measuring customer experience is Net Promoter Score or NPS. There is a high correlation between NPS and growth, both in terms of revenue and profitability. I introduced NPS in GE Healthcare and also ABB, so I'm pleased to see it at Align.","We began our customer experience initiatives several years ago and we are committed delivering a better customer experience for our doctors and their patients. Our goal is to continue to improve how customers experience our products and services. Our businesses, processes and interactions with them in the Invisalign and iTero brands. Over the past two years, we've made improvements in each of these areas and as a result our key customer experience measure for success are Net Promoter Score or NPS has continued to rise.","Our promoters do two extra cases of our detractors and we believe that improving our customer experience and NPS will further increase volume over time. To that end I'm pleased to announce that we recently implemented a new policy than we're closely to align to our business with the way our customers manage their practices and treat patients. The new policy is called Additional Aligners at no charge and it addressed our number one complaint from customers.","We've historically charged customers for additional aligners ordered to be on both covered by the initial treatment plan. With this policy, Align will no longer distinguish between mid-course corrections and case refinements and will allow doctors to order additional aligners to address either treatment need at no charge. We expect this now policy will result in significant improvement in customer satisfaction and loyalty which we believe will help and increase Invisalign utilization and volume over time. David will walk you through the details of the new policy and the impact on our deferred revenues. And with that I'll now turn it over to David for a review of our Q2 financial results.","David White","Thanks Joe.","Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $209.5 million up 5.8% from the prior quarter and up 8.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis consolidated world wider revenues were up 1.42% year-over-year.","Second quarter Clear Aligner revenue up $200.8 million was up 7.4% sequentially and 11.7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis Clear Aligners revenues were up 17.5% year-over-year. The sequential revenue growth reflected higher volumes across all of our major geographies and channels offset by lower worldwide ASPs.","Q2 ASPs were down sequentially about $35 which is primarily due to higher promotional discounts, higher revenue deferrals as we treat more complex cases and foreign exchange. These costs were only partially mitigated by a price increase we implemented in North America, while that price increase took effect April 1, 2015 it only had a partial impact on the quarter as we work through orders placed at the older price.","The largest promotional impact on ASP was related to a new staff Aligner promotion launched in North America in February. This promotion allows active Invisalign trained doctors, who met certain criteria to treat one staff member per year at a reduced price. The promotion is intended to increase practice utilization especially among low volume customers as staff members experienced first hand an Invisalign treatment and have opportunity to share their experience with their patients.","We ran a similar program across EMEA last year albeit on a much smaller scale. While it's still very early in terms of this promotion that group participating EMEA doctors has grown 10% faster than non-participating doctors.","Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels partially offset by lower ASPs primarily ready to foreign exchange rates and higher revenue deferrals as just mentioned.","For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 144.6000 cases were up 10.6% sequentially reflecting growth from our international and North American customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 21.2% reflecting continued strength in international as well as growth from our North America orthodontists and to a lesser extent our North American GP dentists.","For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign cases were up 7.9% sequentially and up 21.6% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists case volume was up 11.1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year.","For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 13.3% sequentially and 30.4% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 7th consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth from our international region.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q2 was 4.6 cases per doctor up slightly from 4.4 in Q2 last year. In North America ortho utilization of 9.5 was a new record increasing from 8.4 in the prior year. In North America GP utilization of 3.0 was up slightly from 2.9 in the prior year. And international doctor utilization of 4.6 was up slightly from 4.5 in the prior year. In Q2, we added 2555 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1120 of which were new North American doctors and 1335 of which were new international doctors.","Our Scanner & Services segment was down sequentially as expected due primarily to the announcement of our next generation iTero Element Intraoral scanner in March. Second quarter revenue of $8.7 million equates to 21.6% sequentially and 32.2% year-over-year reflecting reduced pricing for the current iTero scanner as well as lower scanner volumes as some customers delayed purchase decisions and many others ordered our new iTero element which is expected to comment shipping in North America in the third quarter.","Moving on to gross margin; second quarter overall gross margin was 75.7% down sequentially 0.6 points and up 0.1 point year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.3% down 0.8 points sequentially and down 0.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs as previously discussed and increased training events which are only marginally profitable.","Q2 gross margin for our scanner segment was 15% down 13.3 points sequentially and down 14.5 points year-over-year both as a result of lower volumes and pricing on our iTero 2.9 scanner.","Q2 operating expenses were $116.3 million up sequentially by $14.1 million. This quarter-over-quarter increase reflects the impact of two items; first, Q1 operating expenses included a $6.8 million benefit for the refund of medical device exercise taxes paid in 2013; and secondly, increased spending of $7.3 million related to sales force expansion and other investments.","On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $19.6 million which relates primarily to similar investments and our ERP implementation project which were partially offset by the benefit from foreign exchange rates. Also recall that Q2 2014 benefited from a medical device excess tax refund \u2013 excise tax refund of $1.2 million.","Our second quarter operating margin was 20.2% down 4.5 points sequentially and down 5.1 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to the medical device excise tax benefit recorded in the first quarter which contributed 3.4 points. The balance of the sequential decrease was approximately split equally between lower gross margins and higher operating expenses.","The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of investment in the business related to sales expansion, R&D and ERP as well as foreign exchange rates.","With regard to our second quarter tax provision our tax rate was 26.2% up 2.4 points from our Q1 tax rate. This is primarily due to a higher percentage of certain non-deductible expenses, second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.39 compared to $0.44 in Q1 and $0.43 reported in the same quarter last year. Altogether, the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange as resulted in stronger U.S. dollar including the decline on revenues, the benefit on our non-U.S. dollar operating expenses together with currency exchange losses reported in other income and expense was $0.03 per share.","Moving on the balance sheet; capital expenditures for the second quarter were $10.5 million primarily relating to manufacturing equipment and fit up cost or a second manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico for additional capacity as well as additional cost capitalized on our ERP project.","Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $52.9 million and free cash flow for the second quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $52.4 million. During the second quarter, we paid out $70 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan in which we received an initial delivery of approximately 824 shares of our common stock.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investments were $596.7 million. This compared to $602.6 million at the end of 2014 a decrease of approximately $5.9 million.","With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the third quarter and the factors that did form our view. Starting with the demand outlook, we are pleased with our business especially continued growth from our international regions in progress in North America. For North America most teen case starts occur in the summer months and we expect to have a busy teen season with orthos in Q3. And virtually, Q3 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for our North American GPs.","While we've made progress in North America with both orthos and GPs and expect to see some benefit from our investments in sales force expansion consistent with historical, seasonal trends we are expecting North America volumes to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter.","In our international markets, our European doctors typically spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. China which has now become the largest Invisalign market in Asia Pacific region is beginning to offset some of the seasonality we typically experienced in the Southern European countries. Notwithstanding this factor, however, we anticipate Invisalign international Invisalign case shipments to be down to flat sequentially from Q2.","We expect our Scanner & Services business to be up sequentially with commercial availability of our new iTero element commencing in Q3.","Before I turn to our outlook for Q3, I want to provide you with a financial implications of our new additional Aligner policy beginning in Q3. These changes applied to all new Invisalign whole team and assisted products \u2013 our full product group ship worldwide after July 18, 2015 as well as any open Invisalign whole team or assist cases started prior to this product policy change.","As a result, beginning in Q3 2015, our deferrals will increase as will now recognize lower revenue as a result of providing these additional aligners at no charge and the grandfathering of over 1 million open cases. The effect on our future revenues is two-fold. The first is an increase in the amount we defer for each new case we ship. The second impact is that revenue recognized on each additional aligner shipment will be lower than the amount we have historically recognized until these grandfathered cases complete. The revenue recognized for each additional aligner shipment however will not offset the higher deferrals for new cases for at least two years.","As a result, we expect Invisalign Clear Aligner net revenues for Q3 2015 and Q4 2015 to be lower as a result of this change by approximately $6 million to $7 million and $7 million to $8 million respectively.","One should note that we increased Invisalign prices in North America in Q2 and internationally in Q3 this year. While these price increases largely offset the economic cost of this policy change and you not adequately cover the increase in deferred revenues due to grandfathered cases. While this policy change will slightly impact build revenue because we will no longer charge for the additional aligners the change is immaterial to our cash flows. And as Joe mentioned this new policy is very customer friendly and we believe it will drive further adoption of Invisalign and increased volumes.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 141.8 to 144.3000 cases up approximately 18.5% to 20.6% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q3 net revenues to be in the range of $201.4 million to $205.7 million. On a comparative basis using constant currencies and normalizing for the impact on revenue of our new additional aligner policy our Q3 revenue growth for Clear Aligners would be 13.9% to 16.5% when compared to the same quarter last year.","We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.5% to 75.1% down only slightly quarter-to-quarter primarily as a result of additional aligner policy change and a higher mix of iTero Scanner business.","We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $119.5 million to $120.9 million a sequential increase in operating expense reflects further investments to support our continued international growth and expansion. One-time cost of approximately $2 million primarily associated with severance cost for the organizational changes we announced early today.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 15.1% to 16.4%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.2 million. Taken together we expect diluted EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.31. Recognizing that there a lot of moving parts let me summarize how we see the year shaping up with these impacts included.","First of all, from a volume standpoint we see year-over-year Invisalign growth at to slightly above the midpoint of our 15% to 25% long-term model for revenue. Our North America and international businesses are both responding to investments we've made and we believe that will respond to continued investment within our significant under penetration of the market.","As for revenue, however, 2015 has been impact by significant currency movement when compared to last year. We've seen further weakening of the euro and other currencies since we first gave our 2015 preview during our Q4 earnings call in January. On top of this impact our new additional aligner policy will impact 2015 revenue by approximately $13 to $15 million. We believe the added volumes we're seeing, however, will largely offset both of these factors. As such on a net all in basis we believe our 2015 revenue growth will still be somewhere in the low double digit range consistent with our comments in January and notwithstanding these impacts.","From an operating margin stand point, the incremental impact from FX, the impact from the new additional aligner policy as well as a one-point impact from higher cost with ERP will also be to some extent offset by higher volumes. As a result we believe our 2015 operating margins will be on the order of 4 to 5 points below those reported in 2014. This too is largely consistent with our comments back in January. Not withstanding these moving parts 2015 is shaping up well and our underlying demand for Invisalign remains very good.","With that, I'll turn the time back to Joe.","Joe Hogan","Thanks, David.","Overall, I'm pleased with the Q2 volume growth and continued strength in our international business. We're making progress and we have a lot of positive momentum. On top of my priorities for the first few months is to get direct feedback from our customers and gain insight into their practices and understand how they can better serve their needs. Still coming up to speed on many things after spending the last several weeks on the road, meeting with customers and employees I believe that I have a good understanding of our business and believe that we have many of the key drivers to further our success.","As we scale our business, international is key driver of that growth, the best person to create a unified marketing strategy for the company that leverages opportunities, resources and best practices globally is Raphael. He understands our business and customer dynamics and international markets and will quickly get up to speed in North America. He also has a real passion for improving customer experience as inline with the goals of our company.","In summary, we're making positive and forward looking changes for the company. We just reported a solid quarter of growth and we're making measurable progress and improving our customer experience worldwide. We talk about our opportunities because we have a lot of them, simplifying and unifying our sales and marketing across all regions is an important part of seeing and seizing these opportunities while delivering the best products and experiences for our customers and their patients. I'm confident that these changes will help accelerate our progress and continued success.","Thank you for your time today. I look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts over the coming month. With that, I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Thanks for the questions and welcome Joe. Just a couple of questions on the case growth for the year. It looks like you're seeing, we should expect case growth in about 20% range based on what you've done year-to-date as well as the 3Q guide, it looks like for 4Q you're actually planning on quite a bit of acceleration -- by my math well north of 20%. I'm just curious A, is that the right way to think about how you guys are seeing the back half on a case growth basis and then two, is there anything that gives you greater visibility into 4Q relative to where we are in the year today?","Joe Hogan","Hi, Robert. First of all, your assessment is correct in a sense we're looking at a pretty big outlook in the second quarter versus the first half. There is positive momentum we talked about in the case growth side you could see that, you could see international is very strong. You could see that the ortho side in the United States has been strong too. As far as the clarity of it, it's based -- on that momentum some historical presence that we have. And also relying on the investments we've made particularly in North American market internationally for increased resources to help you drive that.","Robert Jones","That makes sense and then I guess David if I could just follow up on the policy change, anything you can share on what you'd expect the eventual increase to be, I'm just trying to get a sense of how big of a barrier to growth had this been that you guys obviously felt the need to put in place this new policy?","David White","Well, see if I can answer a couple of ways here. When we looked and pulled customers as to their Invisalign experience and how we can improve upon that experience this particular policy change has been the number one item they've asked for. When we look at those customers who are promoters and we compare their growth rates against detractors, we know that whenever we can move a customer who is a detractor or even a passive into a position where they are a promoter, we see significant up tick in volumes as a result.","So the policy change is related to that and trying to see if we can capture additional opportunities to prove they're growing the company. And the unfortunate consequence of it is that it requires us to change our deferral and the estimates that we use for deferrals. And so when we look, when we kind of measure our results going forward the year-over-year comparisons are going to be a little tough to make year-over-year until that kind of normalizes out and that will take -- that will take at least one year for the year-over-year comps to normalize out and then probably a couple of years before all those grandfathered cases work them out and when we actually get back to a more normalized operating model.","Robert Jones","That's helpful. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, and thanks for taking the questions everyone. First, my first question is actually on the experience you've had Joe as you've been out talking to customers over the last, I don't know if its six months or so. One of the things that I've heard from customers that I thought you might want to touch on here and not necessarily the initial days but within your first 12 to 18 months, how the company things about using data and how about company things about interacting with the consumer and also the patient. I wonder as you look at how in the company has positioned itself with social media and outreach another company has used information that it is obtained from customers let's say visiting the Web site. What do you thinking about how you are going to use that data more powerfully going forward? And then I have a follow-up.","JoeHogan","Steve, I have been impressed since I have been here. Look, my experience has always been to be B2B businesses and obviously, we have both here. I call B2B is moving into the ortho or dentistry side and B2C is what we are doing to consumers. If I look at work on consumers, I see it's very well balanced I think in a sense of using social media using print media and there is a lot of experience here over the years in the sense of what's effective and what's not effective in essence and spend.","I'm amazed we could see the statistics I referenced in the opening in the sense of the 27% increase overall in Web business the conversation of Web business into actual unit going on the doc locator. So I feel good about that and I hoping answering your question, secondly, when I see customers, I get two comments all the time. One is, I don't like where I am on doc locator, okay? And that means a lot to me, that means they watch that, it means a whole lot they know generating demand for them. And really the best businesses I have ever been in is when we had customers that looked at the business for demand generation and our customers certainly do that and we do that to our consumer efforts.","Secondly, the question that I heard about were the issues on Aligners and having mid-course corrections or whatever. I know it's another thing we want to emphasize in a sense of our customer MPS growth that was really the number one reason and I almost never got out of a doctors office without that being mentioned. So we are trying to improve that customer experience both in consumer standpoint and also B2B standpoint and from what I have seen, I think we are making great strides here over the last year.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Then my follow-up is related to volume growth. So you guys are taking the volume growth expectations to essentially 20% or better I think that figure previously was somewhat lower say north of 15% but less than 20%. I mean if you have to pick one thing that you have seen incrementally to get you more comfortable with the outlook what might that be and as a corollary to that, can you comment on not necessarily for 2015, but how you think about let's say over the next year the interoperability arrangement that you have with Sirona contributing to the growth story? Thanks so much.","Joe Hogan","Steve, I will let David answer that I think he can be more specific than I can with this point.","David White","Yes. Steve, I think as we look at \u2013 we look at our first quarter performance and we look at our second quarter performance and we measure that against historical patterns here in the company, second quarter and particular we began to see a significant divergence between year-over-year case volume growth and what we have experienced historically when we look at Q2 over Q2 and 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, we are seeing a gap widening there. And that gap is partly what is giving us confidence that we are going to see a stronger second half. So that's the analytical side of it.","And it's clearly more behind that. But, at the highest level that's probably the analytical side of it. But on the other piece of it, which is more qualitative is the fact that we have been doing this for a long time in terms of making investments in our go to market coverage, geographies we are expanding into and so forth. And what we know is that when we invest in directly and go to market, we see a response. And we made the largest step up in investment, I think in the history of the company starting in January and particularly targeted North America. But not discriminating against the international side of it as well. And we are seeing a response to that. And so we are trying to invest into it and keep the growth of the company moving forward and testing just how we continue to grow the markets and invest and what works and what doesn't. We try different promotions. And all these things play together collectively to tell us that we are seeing some traction.","On the Sirona question, while we qualified the scanner, their software updates are still going through testing at this point in time and final qualification. It's supposed to be released later this year, I don't know what the specific date is. You might have to find something on their Web site in that regard from them. But, it's moving forward, but when you look at the up lift, I think we talked about this perhaps in another analyst meeting or earnings call, is the fact when you looked at where most of their install base is particularly on the scanner that we are qualifying most of it is overseas, a lot of it is in GP practice, most of our effort internationally is on the ortho side.","So what we think is important and why we think it will play to our strategy of continuing to become more relevant the GP practice, we don't see it creating an immediate type of uplift in our business. And we think it's going to be longer journey before we will actually see a blip in the radar on it.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks for all the color guys.","Shirley Stacy","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel Nicolaus.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks. And good afternoon guys. Joe maybe the first one for you. In EMEA you guys have reaccelerated the growth and pretty handling, you caught markets like Spain, France, Italy, I mean not really the strongest collection of economies in. I know slightly lower penetration over there, but can you talk to what's allowed the reacceleration the 25% to 30% growth maybe if you can address the sustainability of that number one? And number two, is there anything you are doing differently over there? I mean any secret sauce and how you are attacking those markets that arguably could be transferable to the North American market.","Joe Hogan","Jon good question. I went to Israel in the first couple of weeks I was here to check out the scanner and then up to Amsterdam to really visit some customers and to do some reviews for the team. And I would say, it's funny how Europe is, since individual countries as you know, with different economies and there is different drivers in those industries. And what Ralph and the team have done, they have done a terrific job of being able to figure out in which one of those countries certain formulas actually work for penetration. And even in countries as pressured as Spain which is a great example that drove an incredible amount of penetration in a relatively short amount of time. By actually concentrating resources in a certain ways on those customers to bring them up the speed quickly to make them effective and they can confident in a sense of \u2013 we can move teeth and we can move in predictably.","And it also creates a \u2013 that success creates others wanting to have that success too. In the U.K. on the other hand it hasn't the fairly been an orthodontic push as much as GP. And it's a different formula to go after GP in the U.K also. So Jon just in the time that we have here, I would say we have learned a lot there, Raphael and the team have applied it well. And there is some things honestly we can translate back in North America that can help our records here as we target a different market segments.","Jon Block","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just a follow up maybe Joe, if you can touch on why now for the additional Aligners at no charge, I mean, what you are hearing from the field, why is the proper time now. And then David to your earlier remarks, I mean obviously people don't want to pay extra, I get it, but what's interesting here is that the same time you are also hitting them with a list in the increase price yet. You say you are increasing the goodwill. So can you talk about those dynamics I guess? What do they want? They want predictability, they are willing to pay a little bit more unless but sort of be assured that they are not going to have additional out of pocket expenses as the case progresses, if you can talk to those dynamics. Thanks guys.","Joe Hogan","Jon let me start off. Then I will turn it over to David because David has more experience than in this two. I think as you get into the business and you look at this again, the customer calls and stuff I have made just initially, you hear about this additional aligner thing, it's incredible [year to our] [ph] customer base. And it's a lot of reason but it creates uncertainty. And I think we are working with doctors; doctors want more certainty and patients want more certainty. And we feel like this \u2013 gives them that kind of control, or feeling what that certainty is. And so I think this is much subjective as it is objective. It's something it's been around a long time.","And as I talk to the Align personnel too \u2013 many of them say we should have done this years' ago because we know what the issue is and really haven't addressed it. It wasn't till MPS correcting came in. And we could really weigh what that's meant to our business. But, I think it gave us the determination to take the next steps and to make change. David --","David White","I just had one comment to your question about why now? What's \u2013 it is a decision that we made but obviously but it isn't one that we made over night or made recently. The actual mechanisms and so forth put into motion on this actually started on it few years ago. And as you can imagine, there is a fair amount of infrastructure in the company, it may sound like a simple change. But, there are a number of nuances associated with it that it required IT development efforts and so forth and other changes that have taken us some while to build, to test and to launch. And so it isn't a decision that's been made over night, it's been working for long time.","As it relates to the things that customers are trying to avoid and you mentioned about the price increase and so forth we've had a practice of raising prices modestly every couple of years and typically North America and international have been kind of a little bit out of sync on that because we weren't doing necessarily at the same time.","But we felt that we were creating value here for the doctors and their patients that you help substantiate the timing for the price increase as well which is roughly two years since our last price increases. And in terms of things we're trying to avoid you hear -- George comments you hear comments from doctors about they have a patient that has gone off to school -- in the middle of treatment and they get behind and they come back at Thanksgiving and doctors start -- use to start worrying on the policy about that them coming to the end of the runway when they wouldn't -- and then they have to start paying for it and so that put urgencies on their part and so lots of things -- lots of different kinds of personal circumstances could come up in the lives of the patients that our policy didn't particularly respond very well to.","And the interesting thing about it is the way the doctors treat their patients they quote the patient a price at the beginning of the treatment and their expectation and then the patient's expectation is that's the price and if it take a -- when you look at wires and brackets if it winds up taking a little bit longer to treat, well, it's still one price and yet in our case it will not have taken a little bit longer to treat they ran into the risk that the cost of the doctor would potentially go up and so this just tends to align our -- as Joe commented in his prepared remarks, it just aligns our business practice to the way our doctors practice with the patient.","Joe Hogan","And Jon, I had one more thing on the price question too is, we put a lot of technology in the market over the last few years and we think about G4, G5 and now G6, we need a certain amount of payback for that investment also and so there is kind of price increases reporting value in a market place and to emphasize what David said we look at, we're creating value for customers and we feel that we should paid for that also and that's part of the thought process in the price increase.","Jon Block","Perfect. Thank you guys.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Jon. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger","Great, thanks very much. David, may be could you just give us a little bit more numbers on the new strategy around additional alignments -- aligners can you talk about what's the percentage of cases that actually end up ordering it and how many are we talking about and any numbers you could give us there?","David White","Well we don't typically disclose what percentage of cases require refinements. It is varied when you actually kind of dig down into it it's varied by geography. We see more case refinements and so forth internationally what we do domestically. Some of that is driven by the fact that they are treating more complex cases in some of those geographies. And particularly when we get to APAC we see that. And so as we've looked at the incidence you might say of refinement and so forth, our trend has been -- it has been going up over time and it seems to correlate very closely with the degree and complexity of the cases that we're beginning to treat. And so those are the kind of the trend lines and this policy will just simply make it easier for the doctors to do that without creating additional friction for doing what's right for the patients.","John Kreger","Great, thanks. And then as a follow-up Joe, you said I know you've spent a lot of your initial days talking to customers. Beyond their experience with Invisalign what else are they telling, just curious how are they feeling about their practice, is their business getting better or worse given the economy and are you seeing any interesting changes on the competitive front kind of in the lower complexity end of your market.","Joe Hogan","John, I think its right inline with what I think the statistics you see in dental market right now. Most of the people out there are experiencing growth year-over-year and it looks like it's this year looks very strong, the strongest year they've had. So overall, I mean there is difference between the primary care side and the ortho side, but both of them are reporting, it's really a pretty good business environment now is mostly [indiscernible] is going through.","As far as what customers are thinking and talking about also from an Align standpoint and how we interface with them is its -- often when you talk to them I am asking a lot of the detailed questions about customers and how the technology works and what's happened over the years. And you see a lot of enthusiasm for the product. I think not being here three or four years ago, I think there is a lot of skepticism in the marketplace if we can move teeth predictably and then finish case as well. You see many of the doctors I talked to, in fact, all of them, none of them doubt that we can do the things we're doing they get excited about new products like G5 and G6 and the complexity cases that David talked about too. So overall, these have been good conversations outside of some areas of that we need to address like we just have from a customer engagement standpoint and customer satisfaction standpoint, but in that a pretty good marketplace and a lot of people feeling good about Align and our technology.","John Kreger","Great, thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Shawn, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Joe, just wanted to ask you on the extra aligners or the additional aligners policy. How much of that is may be going after some competitive accounts as well? I know when we go out and talk to some docs we use may be one or two of your other competitors especially one that you've had some legal issues here, what's recently we hear that's one of those things some docs do like about their policy. Does this -- is this done at all the kind of target that? ","And then a follow-up there is just you make some personal changes here, you're addressing a primary customer concern is kind of your first two moves that we're seeing publicly anyway anything else I wouldn't expect that you announce a third change here or something on this call, but there are other changes that we should expect to see out of you here in the next three to six months or these kind of the first two big moves that we should expect for the near term?","Joe Hogan","I'll just answer your last question first, these are the biggest moves I plan to make any time, I can see, I think these are the ones that kind of obvious in the sense that we have to address. From a competition standpoint is, there is not a competitor out there strong enough right now that really force our hand on the additional aligners play. I mean just like the fact is, there is a lot of different dimensions we compete with them both in the United States and internationally that didn't force our hand. Really it's a relationship with our customers, that's what we felt was the right thing to do to address that. It's not saying that five or six years down the road there might have been a different situation, but that wasn't a drive of our decision.","As far as competition goes over all, our competition right now is in the lower end of the segment as you know its in the E5, E10 those kinds of easy cases that are out there. It's not forcing us to make any real competitive moves in the sense of addressing that right now in the marketplace but we -- we're very aware of it, we see it overseas as well in the United States, we know over the next couple of years that will increase, but that's not a specific part of our portfolio, it's the easier part of the portfolio, it's not in the G3, G4, G5 and obviously G6 areas, it's smaller movement of teeth.","I think the last thing I mentioned is that kind of fell apart or wasn't accentuated a lot in our announcement was the lower arch that we just came out with and we positioned out with the E5 form a pricing stand point too. This is something customers have asked for years if they just -- want to buy aligner for that particular arch. It's very practical in the sense of what they've asked for and we hadn't responded to it and this is something we think will help our customers and will help our future competitiveness also.","Jeff Johnson","Okay, understood. And that was actually going to be my follow-up question on the lower arch, you had mentioned at least in the prepared remarks the single arch so we'll assume that's that lower arch, are you saying that you're going to -- price that kind of the Express 5 level is that what I'm hearing? And then David, I thought the Express 5 promotion was going to end in July, it sounds like may be in your remarks that's going to be extended is that correct in North America that that discounted price that went into effect over the last four or five months?","Joe Hogan","Yes. Jeff, first of all, when you look at those product line and all we had to reposition the Express 5 pricing to really -- to allow the single arch to have that price point and then we moved up our E5 price and David you give the specifics of what those numbers were.","Jeff Johnson","Okay.","David White","Yes. So Jeff, we haven't -- I don't think we've formally announced it but have we, okay -- I have been told, yes.","Jeff Johnson","[indiscernible] David.","David White","You're right I remember there was an announcement, I know there was -- the promotion that we ran in Q2 actually started in -- towards the end of Q1 and it ran till June 30. Then we had about a three week period before we launch and announce the single arch product and when we announced the single arch product with that we announced a new promotion for E5, one for dual arch and one for single arch. The pricing on the dual arch E5 is higher, the discount is \u2013 they are saying differently, the discount is not as large what was in Q2, but yet we're also offering a nice discount on the single arch as well so that when you actually look at those two together we think it will attract the -- we think it will attract adoption for those patients at a nice price point it only needs one arch treated and we think it will still preserve a good demand for those that need dual arch. But the pricing has gone up a little bit from where it was in Q2.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Yes, thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Jeff. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, you talked a quite a bit about changes in opportunities you're making in the commercial organization. Would be curious to get your view as to the adequacy or efficiency of the R&D budget, in R&D organization and whether you get there -- is room for some further changes or enhancements in that side of the business?","Joe Hogan","Look, I think from an R&D standpoint there is a lot to do here because there is still a huge amount of penetration we can do especially as we go up the curve in the sense of both on the aligner itself but also the technology we call the digital ecosystem behind that. So look, I like the way it's placed in the sense of the efficiency of it between Russia and United States what we have in Israel on the scanner side. So right now, I feel good about where we are, we put significant number of resources into R&D and technology over the last couple of years, they look like they've been well placed.","I talk about going out and seeing customers but [Joe Cole] [ph] who runs our technology organization has spent significant amount of time with -- he and his people here recently too. And really I'm impressed of what we have here. But this is a technology organization this is some -- we have to put money in technology into these products to continue to advance the science. And given the level of penetration and what we've seen as a result of that investment, I think it's a good thing to do.","Brandon Couillard","Excellent, David, the 700 unit iTero orders in the second quarter, were those upgrades or new users and given the new disclosures and the presentation I appreciate that, care to comment on the size of the installed base in North America?","David White","Well, as far as the 700 orders, I don't have the break out here in front of me. But part of that is obviously doctors that are upgrading some of that is doctors that are getting a second scanner for their office. And then there is other doctors that are getting their first scanner. And all of those are great facts for us. We like to see the adoption and Joe mentioned some of the excitement we've seen generally about it and some of the shows we featured it. As far as the installed base, I'm not sure we've upgraded that except -- year end was it Shirley? What was that do you remember?","Shirley Stacy","An analyst meeting, that was all.","David White","About 4,000 I think was the last time we upgraded at the analyst meeting.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo","Yes. Thanks. And good evening. I just want to talk a little bit about ASPs and margins. I mean I think I understand the commentary this quarter ASPs were impacted by some of the promotional activity may be some higher -- the revenue deferral and FX. But if we kind of look at ASPs in terms of what you're implying next quarter based on the revenue guidance, it looks like ASPs tick down again a fair amount sequentially, is that all attributable to the new deferral arrangement or is there some other promotional activity in Q3 that's kind of worth calling out?","Joe Hogan","Most of that Glen is related to the \u2013 is related to the additional aligners in fact the vast majority of it is. You can compute back into our ASPs probably half of our guidance.","Glen Santangelo","Yes.","Joe Hogan","Substantially all of this is additional aligners. There is we talked really about a price increase that we implemented \u2013 we implemented that effective April 1 in North America. We didn't \u2013 we won't see the full effective of that price increase for North America anyway until Q3. We implemented the price increase of \u20ac50 in international and that came into effect on July 1. And we will probably going to see a partial impact of that in Q3 is just we work off all cases and so forth that we submitted the old price. And those \u2013 and so you got that price uplift there and we got some promotions like we are running on \u2013 continue to run on the E5 and so forth and go from there. But not from a quarter-over-quarter standpoint Q2 to Q3 FX is pretty much not in the picture it's really \u2013 it's really the change in policy with some plus having the price increase and then some additional promotions.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. That's helpful. And David may if I could expand the conversation into margins, kind of sounds like you are modeling fiscal 2015 without margins down 400 to 500 basis points. But, Joe maybe is a good question for you, on last quarter's call, Tom talked about investment in a new ERP system, he talked about making sleep apnea investment now you kind of have the new sort of deferral arrangement. You got FX kind of playing a role in there.","So I'm trying to think about fiscal 2016 margins and I know you don't want to guide on that. But, should I think about or just stay on your margins for the full two years until you sort of work your way or through all the grandfathered cases before we sort of get to a cleaner run rate a couple of years from now. I'm just trying to think about how we should think about the margin progression just kind of knowing the information that you kind of gave us tonight.","JoeHogan","I first start off my answer with our goal here to be between 25% and 30% operating margin. This team knows it. I know that. The Board knows it. We want you guys to know that too. This is unusual \u2013 this is an unusual year and quarter because just what you mentioned there is ERP, sleep apnea, you have \u2013 there is foreign exchange really weighs on year-to-year, it's not going to be quarter-to-quarter. But it's year-to-year right now. And so it's a lot of static in this quarter. And obviously, we prepare to try to make this as clean as possible for you to understand what's going on.","There is also behind this whole thing is a significant volume left, we are seeing that now. We feel good about that volume piece and I'm not ready to declare anything for 2016, but you want to see that kind of volume that go into 2016. And we have built the particular operating model around 2016. We are not done with that yet that helps us to go for the goals that we are striving for between 25% and 30%. David, do you want to add anything?","David White","I think Glen your comment about the change it will take probably a couple of years for that to work its way out. So we are going to have that a little bit of a drag on operating margins for that time period. But, once I think that kind of settles out and so forth like Joe said. We expect to be driving the business towards that long-term model. We have hit that long-term model before. We did in 2014. And we are committed to doing it prospectively going forward.","And I will just add \u2013 I will just add one other thing, as you think about 2016, you realize when we gave our guidance for this year and actually even the comments I made in my remarks today, ERP is a drag on margins of a little over a point right now. And that should fall off mid-year next year. And so there is at least that piece of it, it should get better.","Glen Santangelo","And could you maybe just give us any color on the sleep apnea investment, how big it is and when that should \u2013 when we should anniversary that; did that roll off?","Joe Hogan","Glen, I think the much as I can say about this right now as we are still working that.","Glen Santangelo","Okay.","Joe Hogan","And determining exactly you know what it means we are still in the beginning phases I would say, we might have been a little bit early and mentioning that to you. And as far as we are working through that in subsequent quarterly reports we will bring up the date.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thanks for the details.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Glenn. And thank you everyone for joining us today. This completes our conference call. If you have any further questions please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day."],"1392":["Align Technology, Inc.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners.","David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the first quarter, including some commentary on our view for 2016. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","Q4 was a strong finish to another record year for Align. Better than expected revenue and earnings were driven by record Invisalign volume, which is up 26% year-over-year. These results reflect strong growth across our customer base and geographies from both an increase in the number of submitters, as well as cases per doctor.","In addition, scanner revenue strong of 33% year-over-year exceeded expectations as shipments of our new iTero Element began ramping up this quarter, resulting in record scanner shipments.","For the full year of 2015, over 0.5 million patients started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign, an increase of 22% compared to 13% last year. Our increased growth reflects continued adoption and utilization from international doctors and a solid rebound in North America, both driven by investments in territory coverage and sales and marketing programs, including clinical education.","Product and technology innovation is also a key growth driver for the company and as a result in 2015, we continue to see increased clinical confidence in Invisalign treatment for our customers worldwide.","For Q4, North America Clear Aligner volume was both sequentially and year-over-year up, reflecting record Invisalign utilization and a record number of submitting doctors. Sequential growth was driven by North American GP dentists with an increase in both the number of submitters and cases per doctor.","North American ortho volume also increased sequentially, although less so given Q4 is a seasonally slower for teenage orthodontic case starts. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 North America volume growth was driven by both orthos and GPs, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign and expansion of our customer base.","For the full year, North America volume increased 18% compared to 8% last year and a three-year average of 12% reflecting the positive impact of our sales force expansion and go-to-market changes we announced on our earnings call last January.","We're very pleased with the acceleration in growth rate and believe that we will see further progress in North America as we continue to drive greater adoption and utilization, and the ortho channel increased our share of the team market and improved patient conversion.","Q4 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 17% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. Our international business continues to be very strong across all countries, driven by both an increase in the number of submitters and in cases per doctors in EMEA and continued expansion of our customer base in APAC.","In EMEA, Q4 volume was up 34% year-over-year and we had a record quarter across all markets. We continue to see strong performance in our five core country markets and are building momentum in our new geographies.","For the full year 2015, EMEA volume growth of 30% was balanced across both ortho and GP channels. We also saw strong growth in Spain, the U.K. and the Mediterranean country markets, using our new selling process, which helps accelerate clinical confidence.","In addition, newly integrated country markets previously indirect in the Nordics, Eastern Europe and Benelux are showing very good growth in their first full year of our direct focus.","In Asia-Pacific, our Q4 volume reflected strong year-over-year growth of 37%, notwithstanding a seasonally slower period coming off a strong summer quarter.","During the quarter, we celebrated our 10th anniversary in Japan with a full day customer forum with over 200 Japanese doctors. We also participated in the China Annual Orthodontic Society meeting with nearly 400 doctors, and in December we attended our first Indian orthodontic congress in India where we are beginning to invest in trained orthodontists in a three key cities: Mumbai, New Delhi, and Pune.","For the full year, Clear Aligner volume in APAC increased by 39%, reflecting both expansion of our customer base, as well as an increased utilization. In China, Invisalign volumes doubled over the prior year and Japan grew more than 50% for the third consecutive year.","In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q4 increased 24% year over year. This reflects continued adoption across our customer channels, but more pronounced in North America where we have the greatest sales and marketing focus on teens.","For the full year, over 141,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, reflecting 21% growth compared to 16% growth in 2014. In North America, the growth rate of our teenage cases continues to outpace adult cases.","Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA and APAC combine traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PROFITABILITY, and social media to engage customers at every point in the consumer purchasing journey.","Consumer interest in demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow as we can see from increases in key program metrics worldwide. For example, social media engagement and lead generation increased across all regions in 2015 and more than 8 million consumers visited one of our Invisalign consumer websites and almost 1.3 million of those visitors searched for an Invisalign provider on our site, up nicely from the prior year.","In Q4, our Scanner Sales & Services business revenues were up 74% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year due to the introduction of our new iTero Element scanner, which has been received very enthusiastically by our customers.","For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with digital scanners in North America were flat from last quarter at 40%. We believe due in part to fewer scanner sales in Q3 as we transition to our new iTero Element scanner.","While we are talking about our Scanner business, I want to mention someone who has been an important part of the iTero's growth and success. Tim Mack, Vice President Scanner & Services, will be retiring in March after 25 years in the medical device industry.","Tim joined the management team at Align when we acquired Cadent and he has been instrumental in integrating the Scanner business into the company and bringing new innovations to market like iTero Element scanner.","Over the next two months, Tim will transition his responsibility for our Scanner & Services business to Raph Pascaud, the Chief Marketing Portfolio and Business Development Officer, who will assume the role of General Manager for our Scanner business. We're going to miss Tim, but I know he is going to enjoy having a personal life again after some very busy years.","Now, I'll turn it over to David.","David White","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $230.3 million, up 10.9% from the prior quarter and up 15.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago.","On a year-over-year comparative basis, our fourth quarter revenue growth rate was lower by approximately eight points related to the Additional Aligner Policy we implemented last July and the impact of foreign exchange rates.","Fourth quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $214.0 million was up 7.9% sequentially and up 14.8% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes.","Q4 ASPs were slightly down, slightly sequentially, about $5, due to foreign exchange rates, as well as a small shift in product mix towards our low end products. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily to the Additional Aligner Policy change and foreign currency exchange rates.","For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 160.4 thousand cases were up 8.8% sequentially, reflecting growth from our international North American customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 26.4%, driven by growth across all regions.","For North America orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 1.5% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 24.5% year-over-year.","For North American GP dentists, case volume increased 9.4% sequentially and was up 20.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 16.8% sequentially and 34.8% year-over-year.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q4 was a record 4.9 cases per doctor, up from 4.4% in Q4 last year. North America ortho utilization was 9.9, up from 8.6 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was a record 3.1, up from 2.9 in the prior year.","And international utilization was also a record at 5.0, up from 4.5 cases per doctor in Q4 last year. For the full year 2015, we achieved record Invisalign utilization across all three customer channels.","In Q4, we added 2,670 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,270 of which were new North American doctors and 1,400 of which were new international doctors. This is consistent with the same quarter a year ago. For the full year, an additional 9,795 doctors became Invisalign providers, reflecting continued expansion of our customer base, especially outside the U.S.","Our Scanner & Services revenues for the fourth quarter were $16.2 million, up 73.7% sequentially and 33.4% year-over-year. We're excited to be ramping up production and shipping the new iTero Element scanners to our customer practices given the high volume of preorders we have received since its announcement in March.","Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.0%, down 0.9 points both sequentially and year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower ASPs from currency, which amounted to approximately 0.9 points, as well as the Additional Aligner Policy change by about 0.7 points, which was partially offset by lower costs per unit.","Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.9%, also down 0.9 points, both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by higher freight costs and increased trading activity, which carries a lower margin.","Q4 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 37.7%, up 23 points sequentially as a result of higher scanner ASPs and lower manufacturing costs associated with the new iTero Element.","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 gross margin was up 7.5% as a result of product mix shift to the lower-cost iTero Element, coupled with reduced service costs.","Q4 operating expenses were $113.5 million, down sequentially by $6.1 million, primarily due to lower marketing and media spend. Recall also that in Q3 we incurred severance costs for organizational changes, as well as costs related to the termination of product development efforts targeting for the obstructive sleep apnea market, which contributed to the sequential decline as well.","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating expenses were up $14.3 million, or 14.4%, as a result of our sales expansion efforts, as well as our European implementation project.","Our fourth quarter operating margin was 25.8%, up 7.5 points sequentially and approximately flat year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to increased Clear Aligner volume and lower expenses.","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating margin was impacted by approximately three points from foreign currency and the Additional Aligner Policy.","With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate of 18.1% was down 6.3 points from our Q3 tax rate. This was primarily the result of a more favorable mix of earnings and lower tax geographies, lower tax expenses realized upon the filing of certain tax returns, and to a lesser extent, the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit. These items together amounted to about an incremental $0.04 benefit in earnings per share in the quarter.","Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 compared to $0.34 reported in Q3 and $0.48 reported in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.07 related to the company's new Additional Aligners Policy.","Finally, the year-over-year impact on the fourth quarter from the Additional Aligner Policy change as well as assuming constant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates, was approximately $0.11 per share.","Moving to the balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $16.8 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Juarez, Mexico, as well as our ERP implementation.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $79.4 million and free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $62.6 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 179,000 shares of stock, amounting to $11.2 million in open market repurchases.","As a side note, our last 12 months of stock repurchases, together with cash used to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of investing employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued, amounted to 66% of our worldwide free cash flow.","We believe our free cash flow generation and these repurchases are consistent with our express capital allocation objectives returning cash flow in excess of that needed to run and grow the business to our shareholders.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments were $679 million. This compared to $603 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $76 million.","Of our $670 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, $236 million was held by the U.S., and $443 million was held by our international entities.","Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2015 results. In 2015, we shipped a record 583.2 thousand Invisalign cases, up 22%. This reflects 32.5% volume growth from international doctors and 17.7% volume growth from our North American doctors.","Revenue was a record $845.5 million, up 11% year-over-year, including the impact of foreign exchange and the Additional Aligners policy. Full year operating income of $188.6 million or 22.3% of revenue, which included 1.6 points of impact from additional aligners and foreign exchange rates on a constant currency basis.","Our operating results also included approximately $12 million of costs related to ERP and a one-time refund of $6.8 million for medical device excise tax refund, which will not recur in 2016.","Free cash flow was $184.5 million or 22% of revenue, consistent with our long-term model target of 20% to 25%. For the year, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of Align stock for $101.8 million. 2015 diluted EPS was $1.77.","To recap, 2015 was a strong year for Align, and despite several headwinds, including foreign exchange rates, as well as the impact of our new policy -- Additional Aligner policy, we did better than planned across the Board. Strong Invisalign growth offset much of these headwinds, enabled us to achieve revenue growth in operating margins above our original outlook.","With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the first quarter and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. Consistent with current demand trends, we expect North America volume to be up sequentially in Q1, primarily driven by the ortho channel.","For our international business, while we expect continued strong year-over-year growth, Q1 is a seasonally slower period in Europe due to winter holidays, and notwithstanding sequential growth expected from APAC, we anticipate total international volume to be down sequentially.","As for our scanner business, demand for our new iTero Element scanner has been strong. As a result, we expect Q1 scanner shipments to be up significantly sequentially. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows.","Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 161.3 thousand to 163.7 thousand cases, up approximately 23.4% to 25.2% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $232.5 million to $236.6 million.","We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 73.5% to 74.1%, slightly down sequentially, primarily due to a higher mix of our scanner business which carries lower gross margins. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $130.9 million to $132.4 million.","Typical of prior years, Q1 operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter, based on several factors. First of all, employee compensation related costs will increase in Q1 due to our annual cycle of employee compensation reviews, which include salary increases and promotions, as well as annual stock grants and employer paid payroll taxes such as Social Security taxes in the U.S. that we had set with the start of each new calendar year.","Second, incremental investments and sales territory coverage, go-to-market and product development activities will increase operating expenses as we add additional resources, much of which is front-end loaded in the year.","And, finally, we're entering the last stages of our European implementation program and will not be able to capitalize as much of our total program costs as compared to the earlier stages of the program.","Our Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 17.2% to 18.2%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, this is relatively consistent with historical Q4 to Q1 trends if you exclude ERP investments and the impact from a higher mix of our Scanner business.","Our effective tax rate should be approximately 25% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.1 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.40.","Let me now provide some directional comments with respect to the full year 2016. From a total revenue standpoint, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be in the low to mid 20s% and somewhere in the upper half of our long-term operating model.","From a volume perspective, we expect continued strong growth in Invisalign case shipments. For Scanners, based on current backlog and demand for our new iTero Element, we expect Scanner revenue to be approximately double that of 2015.","Notwithstanding higher topline growth in 2016, we believe 2016 operating margins will be relatively consistent with our 2015 results for the following reasons. First of all, 2016 will bear the full year impact of the Additional Aligner policy, which we anticipate will impact revenues by approximately $25 million to $30 million.","Secondly, we anticipate higher overall mix of iTero scanner revenue in 2016. And while the new iTero Element scanner is more profitable than the older version, it still carries lower gross margins than Invisalign Clear Aligners and, therefore, will somewhat dampen total margins.","Finally, while we expect to complete most of the implementation of our new ERP system by midyear, the smaller percentage of these program costs can be capitalized in these later stages, meaning more of these costs will now be included in operating expense.","For the full year, we expect ERP implementation expenses to be relatively consistent with 2015. We believe these investments are key to continued customer adoption and accelerating our growth. Similar to last year, many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful returns.","All included, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating profits to account for somewhere in the range of 55% to 60% of our full year results.","With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks, David. As you have seen from our record 2015 results, the investments we made in the onset of the year have helped us accelerate growth and increase adoption of Invisalign globally. These results reaffirm our confidence in and commitment to new investments in 2016.","This year, we will continue to invest in international expansion in new country markets like India and Korea, sales in customer support resources, as well as product and technology innovation to address such things as treatment times, indication unique to teens and predictability.","In addition, we will establish our first order acquisition and treatment planning facilities in international regions, so we can be closer to our customers, improve our operational efficiency, and provide doctors with the great experience to further improve their confidence in using Invisalign to treat more patients, more often. All told, we believe these investments will further extend our competitive advantage and leadership in the market.","Thank you for your time today. I look forward to sharing more details with you as the year unfolds. I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks. Just on the revenue outlook for the year, based on the full year outlook and the doubling of the scanners, it looks like you are implying high teens Invisalign revenue growth. I was just hoping maybe you can share a little bit more around the assumptions behind that, both from a volume versus pricing perspective.","And then, if you could, share anything on geographically how you are thinking about the year, specifically curious about APAC, just given some of the concerns out there and the strong growth you've seen. Just anything you can share behind the what seems to be very healthy Invisalign revenue growth would be helpful.","David White","Yeah, Rob, David. So, I'll give you a couple of pieces. Let me kind of start with the scanners since that's where you started from. We announced the iTero Element scanner back in March of last year and really only began shipping that product back in September.","And during that interim period, we were actively promoting the product and selling it and generating interest at all kinds of conferences and so forth and taking orders for the product at that point in time.","And so since September to December, which we just began shipping that product, we have accumulated some backlog, and we've shipped what we had supply capabilities of. And we were starting the year with a very healthy demand profile for the product that is really driving the comment I made about we are expecting that revenue to double year-over-year.","We wouldn't expect it to double in 2017, although we'd love to have that high quality problem. But that's kind of how we are looking at 2016 as it relates to the scanner business.","When you look at the Clear Aligner business, the only color I'll give you as it relates to volumes and so forth is that you can see by the slides and our commentary and so forth, our international business is growing at a faster rate than what North America is, notwithstanding the fact that we got a great rebound in North America.","Our EMEA business is growing in 2015, grew roughly at the same rate as APAC did, although a few points behind but pretty close. And we expect to continue to see strong growth in each of those international regions as we continue to make investments in expanding our territory coverage. And as Joe mentioned in his comments, actually entering into some new geographies.","When you look at North America, like I said, we had a great rebound. We're expecting that to continue. We have continued to add territory coverage here in the U.S. And we have seen the results, I think, of some of that manifest in not only volumes, but higher utilization rates in both channels in North America.","So, when you net all that together, we're seeing 2016 from a revenue standpoint being somewhere, as I indicated, the growth being in the mid to low 20s%. And I don't know if that gives you enough color there or not.","Robert Jones","No, no, that's helpful. I guess just to move away from revenue, it seems like obviously there's a lot of momentum there. But in the operating profit side, if I look at the 1Q guidance and then the outlook, even with the second half operating profits to account for 55% to 60%, it still seems like even with that back half ramp, you are expecting the year to be below those three to five-year long-term targets.","So, either one of you, but maybe Joe, curious now that you have had a little more time with the business, is that 25% to 30% operating profit margin range, is that still the right metric to represent the profit profile for the company, or is it something different, in your mind?","Joe Hogan","Rob, I think it's still the right profile. If you take our end of the year operating profit, you add for Additional Aligners and you add for FX, we're right at the bottom part of that range right now. So, I mean I don't see any reason to change it at all.","Robert Jones","Got it. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Bob. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Hogan","Hey Jon.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thank. Good afternoon. One really high-level one, maybe for you, Joe, and then some specific annoying ones for David on the guide. So, Joe, it's going to sound like a little bit of a suck up question, but, really, you have got a base that is maybe 3X what it was back in 2007. You've got a product that is really not recurring, and yet you are recapturing the growth rate.","And so can you just talk to us at a high level, what is allowing you to recapture this level of maybe 20%-plus Clear Aligner growth, and then how many more investments do you need to layer on from, call it, exiting 2016 from that level if you would going forward?","Joe Hogan","Jon, I'd just say the growth is deep and wide in a broad sense. And so, if you look at our utilization levels across the Board, you see them going up even in GP and ortho, substantially.","Secondly, from a breadth standpoint, where you look internationally, the growth from an international standpoint, it is in new markets, but also there is some depth in new markets, too, like we're seeing in Spain and with TFM and things we have talked to you about before.","I think there is also -- there is an adoption profile for plastic aligners versus metals and brackets that's starting to be accepted on a wider sense, and there is a lot more confidence out there in the sense of the use for it.","I mean we see that in our discussions with orthodontists and doctors around the world, too and people that have been with us for 11 years and people that have been with us for three or four.","If I go off and I talk about the investment aspects, I mean, this is -- it's a high-growth business. It requires continuing investments in order to do that. I think a lot of what you have seen, Jon, we're doing this from a non-dilutive standpoint if you take out an additional aligner policy and you pull away some of the ERP.","But these are investments. You take a look at the ERP, we need that. I can't tell you how much this business needs an ERP platform in order to grow in the future. We basically juggle this business on Excel spreadsheets in a way that's just not a good long-term way to conduct this business.","There's so many things we do that are a lot of arms and legs around here that we should be used for really interpreting information rather than generating it at times. And I could go on and on about that.","Secondly, to go into Korea, to go into Taiwan, to move into India, those aren't just salespeople. There is certain infrastructure, certain compliance, certain things that you just need to invest in to ensure that you adequately go into those markets and we will continue to do that.","But hopefully, Jon, and you know us well, you see that we're doing that in a sense of not telling you to hang on for three years. We're getting good returns on those investments. And what David and I are projecting right now, we'll see the same thing in 2016.","Jonathan Block","Okay. That was very helpful. And then, it dovetails well into the next question for you, David, or just sort of three quick little parts. You mentioned flat operations margins year-over-year, but I do think you have roughly an additional or an incremental 12 or 13 from the Additional Aligner program -- full year versus six months.","So, should I think about it on a non-GAAP basis the op margins are up maybe roughly 100 bps year-over-year? And then you mentioned the ERP expense. What is that that is similar to 2015?","And then, finally, just the tax rate -- R&D tax credit, it looks like we have going forward, so does the tax rate going forward look like it was for full year 2015? Thanks, guys.","David White","So flat on the operating margins and your question in that regard. If you look, again, back to what Joe just iterated, if you pull out FX, you pull out Clear Aligner and you pull out the portion of ERP that we would not expect to be recurring on a long-term basis, we're in the range of our long-term model.","When we gave guidance for 2015 you will recall a year ago, we were facing a lot of FX headwinds at that point in time and we articulated that our strategy was that we would grow our way out of the FX challenge. And I think if you look at our results this last year, we largely succeeded in reclaiming a lot of that headwind.","Now, since then, the dollars continued to strengthen, so we are still chasing a little bit of it. So, it's not quite -- we're not anticipating this to be as big of an impact in 2016 as what it was in 2015. But if I neutralize for that, we're inside the long-term model and it is a modest improvement, as you articulated, over 2015 when you look at it apples-to-apples.","On the tax rate question you had, one of the -- our guidance for Q1 was 25% or you saw that our rate last year was 22 point something I think was the effective rate. Part of one of the things that's driving it -- in fact, probably the largest thing that is actually driving that is the growth of our Scanner business.","And those sales are largely being made here in the United States where they are taxed at the -- our U.S. federal and state tax rates. And that is driving some pressure on the tax rate as it currently stands. So my best guidance for you at this point would be somewhere in that ballpark. I haven't got a better number than that.","Jonathan Block","Okay, perfect. Works for me. Thanks guys.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Jon.","Joe Hogan","Thank you, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw","Well, thanks for taking the questions. And thank you operator, that was the best pronunciation of my last name I've ever heard. First question is actually on Element gross margins, you mentioned that they are likely to be higher relative to the prior iteration of iTero. My sense is that what we saw in this quarter is probably not a great barometer for how high they can go as you are still -- is that a fair assessment?","Joe Hogan","It would be, Steve. Given that we're just starting to ramp the product and so forth, we still have a learning curve that we're going down. We're still or were still experiencing a yield ramp on the product. So, we're expecting it to be reasonably better in 2016 than in 2015.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Got it. And then two quick ones for Joe. One is on expansion of the commercial force. Can you speak to the magnitude of ads in 2016, how they might compare to what you did in 2015, appreciating that 2015 was a big year?","And then, normally, in January as you think about working with Align over the years, normally in January we hear a little bit about product launches, plans for innovation, it wasn't as big a focus. Could we see something interesting at, say, the AAO, or is this maybe a quieter year on the product launch front? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Steve, first of all, from kind of a commercial investment standpoint as the basis of your question, I'd say very similar to 2015, but you would say more up in international and a little bit less in North America from a ratio standpoint.","I think that expansion is something we just need to do. We know we get a decent return on it, as I mentioned before and we don't see it as being dilutive. I don't think we see it as being expansive. And Steve your second question was?","Steve Beuchaw","The question is about [Technical Difficulty] for product launches, innovation cadence in 2016.","Joe Hogan","Yeah. We'll have some announcements on product launches and some things that we think will be pretty exciting for the industry. In that sense, I can't necessarily talk about that now. We're still moving through different clinicals and things that exist out there.","But I think from a broader standpoint too Steve -- not think I know, we continue to focus a huge amount on engineering. We see so many additional malocclusions that we can address through our technology. We'll continue to invest that way going forward so we can capture a larger and larger percentage of the market. But we'll have some exciting announcements in 2016.","Steve Beuchaw","Well, looking forward to it. Thanks for all the comments.","Joe Hogan","Yeah, thanks Steve.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question John.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Joe, I know sometimes it can be hard for you guys to give a -- get a good market assessment, given all those share gains you have gotten, but what is your view, if you go around the horn, the U.S. orthodontic market, GP, and then Asia and Europe, does the market feel to you like it's getting better or worse based upon feedback you are getting from your sales reps?","Joe Hogan","John, my comment would be that it seems to be stable. I think we saw an uptick in the market in 2015, and you go through the statistics and you can see it. Fortunately, we just traveled around the world for sales kickoff meetings from North America, Pacific and also Europe. In each one of those cases, we talk about a market that's pretty much stable from year-to-year, in that sense. I wouldn't count on a big market uplift. So what we're basically expressing here in our 2016 forecast is continued penetration in those markets. ","John Kreger","Great. Thanks. And then, maybe just to expand a little bit more about what you're hearing out of China, given some of the headlines in that region. How comfortable are you that the really strong growth that you guys have seen in the last year can hold up as we move through 2016?","Joe Hogan","China is really interesting in this sense. We saw we doubled our growth last year. We spent a lot of focus in resources on China. The quick answer to your question is that we feel good about China growth next year.","We -- just a week ago, we were together with that team. That team is very excited about it as we move into 2016. They are not feeling a lot of what we see and get concerned with from a Western standpoint with what's going on with the Chinese GDP figures and also some of the industrial investment that is going on there.","Look, John, I'm long enough in business to always be on my toes in this sense, that something might change, but from what we see right now and what we hear from our sales team from a customer base is we're looking for China demand volume to be equivalent to what we saw in 2015 in the sense of continued growth.","John Kreger","Great. Thanks. And then one last one. Are you seeing any uptick in electronic case receipts for Clear Aligners from any of your partner scanner companies or is it pretty much all still coming in through iTero?","Joe Hogan","It's pretty much all through iTero. We're seeing a little bit right now, but we're just on the beginning edge of the qualifications of those. So specifically Serono. You know that is done. There's a qualification aspect that they are going through with their customers to make that work, but there is nothing that I would say is material and meaningful yet.","John Kreger","Great. Thank you.","Joe Hogan","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question Richard.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I had two. One, first, just on the ASP. I caught some of the company-comments that I'm not sure I heard. Can you just go over again what the mix shift was with respect -- I think you said in 4Q in particular that you had a shift towards less complicated cases.","And I just wondered, one, was that correct? And then, two, does that have anything to do with just the strength that we're seeing and the pickup in GP utilization? And is that that they are intending to use lower kind of -- or do less complicated cases?","David White","Yeah, Rich. This is David. We announced back in June or July -- I can't remember a specific date on it, a single arch option for both our Express 5 and i7 product, which is our lightest stage internationally and domestically as well as the E10 and light product, which is the 10 stage and 14 stage, respectively -- respective products.","And those products have -- and part of the objective of that was to satisfy a need that doctors had in treating people who only had one arch to be treated. Historically, when doctors needed to use an Invisalign product to treat a single arch, they had to pay for the price of both.","So, we bundled a -- we debundled that and gave them basically the option to divide a single arch. And we've seen -- if you look at the growth of that product or that class of products in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of our business, they are going at roughly a 50% faster rate than our full cases.","And we don't think that rate will necessarily continue, but that in and of itself drove some shift in our overall ASP mix to those lower side products and put some pressure on ASPs as a result.","Now, two things about that. One is, when we look at the data from -- the demand from that, we certainly know how many single -- we certainly know how many dual cases we were selling previously where the doctor only wanted to treat one arch.","And we can look at how the adoption of that single arch product has accelerated doctors actually using the Invisalign product relative to what they were doing previously. And so we believe we've gotten a lot of incremental volume at the low end for that and so incremental income on the margin from that at the same time.","Richard Newitter","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. And then, Joe, just with respect to some of the investments that you were talking about, we've heard you in China and getting closer to the customer, we've heard kind of some explanation around the initiatives there that you want to implement.","Can you tell us kind of which ones in particular are the top priority as we move into first half of this year and what kind of the payoff landscape or timeline might be for those? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Our top focus right now is APAC. That's where we have the most diversity in the sense of a customer base and I think the most lag time lag just from a distance standpoint and with our current operations. We move over order acquisition, which is basically when someone takes an impression, we do a CT scan and then lower it to a digital file. We move that over, getting it close to the customer who will allow us to improve that part.","And then we move treatment planning treatment, which I think is the biggest customer satisfier that we can move with quickly. And we will move that over to different parts of Asia as we go through 2016 and we'll begin probably with EMEA also to begin the foundation of that.","Our resources are somewhat limited at times. So, we have to get started in APAC and we will figure out how much residual capacity we have from movement over to Europe on the treatment piece. But we'll move forward with both of those.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Joe Hogan","Yeah, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis of Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Lewis","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the teen segment. You had a nice quarter there. You pointed out the continued strength in North America. Joe, I was hoping you could spend a minute or two just talking about where teen is internationally at this point? And what's the strategy there over the next call it one to three years to really start driving teen in international markets?","Joe Hogan","It's a good question, Chris. I mean I'll just stand on North America for a second. We saw good results this year and even though they are good results, it's still 75% of the marketplace and we're not even near the penetration rate that I feel our product deserves in the sense of that particular demographic.","Taking what we have learned from a promotional standpoint a clinical confidence standpoint with customers are moving it overseas. There are parts overseas where we do see better teen engagement, in different parts of APAC and some parts of Europe. But to tell you that there's a magic formula for North America that's transportable to these other markets, it's not.","It's very similar to what I had in GD [ph] Healthcare too. When you start to move into these markets, they all have their different idiosyncrasies, so we're going to have to look at each one of the large ones and make sure that we bring our teen product forward in the sense that our customer base is comfortable with it and we're right kind of clinical information that supports that.","So, we known in North America we can do that, we\u2019re confident we'll do it around the world and we can make those kind of progress we saw in North America this year. But there's going to be a lot of work year-in and year out both from a clinical standpoint and also from a sales standpoint and a channel standpoint in order to continue to penetrate that base.","Chris Lewis","Got it. And you talked -- you continue to carve the important of the clinical confidence. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. How are the strategies you've implemented here so far progressing per your expectations? And what types of strategies are you implementing for this year to continue that?","Joe Hogan","Chris, I'd say, starting in Europe, it has gone really well with the TFM process that we use, which is, I think you know, is it's our focused touch point strategy that we have with customers to bring them up the learning curve as quickly as possible. I digress one minute, if you think about what are we doing here in this business, we're taking customers from an analog process to a digital process.","And, frankly, it's not easy. I mean, if you take a E5 or E10 case, it might be easy, but as you go up the scale and you start doing different kinds of malocclusions, it gets pretty complicated. And we have to be able to work through -- get customers up that learning curve as quickly as possible in that clinical piece.","But also the business piece, too, because cash flow and different things that they associate with their analog business changes pretty dramatically as you move into a digitized business, also.","So, from a clinic -- back to the major point that you're making from a clinical piece is doctors want that confidence that they start a case that they can be confident they're going to finish it. They are not embarrassed in front of their customer. They have to call them back in a lot of times.","And TFM and those kinds of processes we are putting in place. And frankly, some other things that we're working on inside the company we think are going to be able to improve that clinical competence piece as we go forward.","Chris Lewis","Appreciate it. And then, David, maybe just one more. In terms of Invisalign ASPs, you talked about that shift towards the lower end products. Just looking out in the guidance, it looks like maybe ASPs are down slightly sequentially in the first quarter. I guess first, is that correct?","And then, second, any color you can provide on just how we should think about ASPs trending throughout the year in 2016, both in North America along with international markets? Thanks.","David White","So to your point on Q1 ASPs and so forth, when you look at -- as our business grows, there's a number of things that impact the ASPs, as I talked about previously, any product mix shift from full cases to light cases.","Any shift from doctors that are high volume doctors to doctors that are less volume-driven doctors can have an impact on it because of our Advantage program, which incentivized doctors to go deep into their practices.","And so when we look at those influences going over into 2016, we do have a little bit of ASP pressure on Q1, not very much. Consistent with what we saw in Q4, which was I think $5 I mentioned in my script. And over the course of the year, we would -- as our utilization rates go up, we would expect to see that doctor engagement create some ASP pressure as well.","But generally speaking, we would look at ASPs over the course of the year for other factors that we're working on that I won't go into the details on would offset some of those impacts.","And so right now, I think we would continue to say holding FX aside and Additional Aligner policy aside and so forth, I think we would say that our ASPs would still be in the flattish type of directional indication.","Chris Lewis","All right.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Chris. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Most of my questions have been addressed, but a couple of bookkeeping items for you, David. As far as the ERP program goes, should we expect that $12 million roughly of spend that is being absorbed in the P&L to go away in 2017? And could you sort of describe some of the benefits you anticipate on the other side of this?","David White","Yeah. The vast majority of that $12 million we would expect to go away in 2017. We will be -- we do have built into 2016 a portion of operating costs associated with the new platform and so forth. So, you won't get all the benefit of the $12 million, but you get the vast majority of it.","In terms of benefits, there's a number of them, and I think the ones that we're probably most excited about from a business standpoint have to do with our ability to offer products and services to our customers today -- tomorrow that are very difficult for us to offer to them today because of some system limitations.","And so we have a number of ideas that we have not announced at this point that we're actually working on that we hope to be able to launch not far after the date we go live on our new ERP system.","And so we think our doctors are going to appreciate some of those changes. We think it will drive improvements in their customer experience. We think it will allow us to get our business more closely aligned with their business model at the same time so that we practice our relationship with them more closely approximates the type of relationship they have with their patients. And I won't go into more details than that, but we think that the customer experience will be greatly enhanced.","And then the other thing is from an internal standpoint, when we launch new programs here in the company, there is a significant amount of heavy lifting that has to be done even to announce and launch a new promotion.","And when you consider that we have got a number of systems that all have to be updated, they have got to be tested before we can go live on them, et cetera, we believe that having one consistent platform for the company is going to improve our agility as a company, will allow us to be much more responsive to opportunities that we see in the marketplace, as well as our time to launch new initiatives and so forth.","Brandon Couillard","And then last one, can you give us a sense of what we should be embedding for the currency headwind on revenues next year and then any sense of CapEx full spend for the full year?","David White","When you say headwinds in 2016 for FX, right now we are accounting zero because we gave our guidance for the year based at today's current rates. And I don't know what their euro is at right now, but $1.08, $1.09, something like that and all the other currencies roughly at those rates.","On the CapEx side, I think our guidance for the quarter was -- is in the press release, like $20 million, $25 million. And I think for the year, it's somewhere going to be in about the $60 million range. Most of that will be spent on manufacturing capacity additions.","Brandon Couillard","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Operator, we'll take one last question please.","Operator","Our last and final question comes from the line of Jeff Matthews of Ram Partners. Mr. Matthews please proceed with your question.","Jeff Matthews","Hi, thanks very much. Can you hear me?","Shirley Stacy","Yeah. Hi, Jeff.","Joe Hogan","Clearly hi.","Jeff Matthews","I have two questions. One is a follow-up on Brandon's ERP question. You don't seem to be having the cost overruns and glitches that many other companies do when they get into this. Is that accurate? And is the timetables for going live roughly the same as it was when you started?","David White","So, to your first part of that question, it is a -- I think for any company a change of an ERP system is a significant undertaking. We have a lot of people engaged in doing this. A lot of energy and momentum behind it. So, I wouldn't say it has been easy, but we're making great progress.","And when we announced the program a year ago in the same call at the end of Q4 of 2014, we expect it to be going live somewhere around midyear 2016, and we are still on that plan.","Jeff Matthews","Great. Thanks. And then, what I'm really interested in is India and coming on the heels of just marking your 10th year in Japan, because I know you spend a lot of time in Japan working through case complexities before you go into China and I'm just wondering how you view the potential in India relative to what you have seen in China, and is there anything that makes long-term potential there markedly different positively or negatively? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Jeff, I have been doing business in China and India for 15, 20 years and I think they are always in jeopardy of comparing those two markets and trying to make them similar. They are just night and day. I think India has a good opportunity for us. You can see we're going into Tier 1 kind of cities that we will start in. There is a good number of orthodontic case starts that are similar to China, but the similarity really stops there.","And so we expect good growth, but I don't expect a lot of what we're doing in China to be transferable to India in the sense from a commercial standpoint. And we're going to have to get into each one of those cities and learn and adapt properly as we move forward. But it is a focus for us. We're going to have to be successful there. But we're going to take it -- we're going to start one step at a time, and 2016 will be a foundational year for us.","Jeff Matthews","Understood. Thanks very much Joe.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks Jeff. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and industry events, including the Chicago Midwinter Meeting at the end of February.","We also hope you'll join us for our Financial Analyst Meeting, which is scheduled for Thursday, June 2nd, in New York City.

John doesn't officially start until the November 10, so we won't make him answer any questions about the business, but he'll be happy to take a couple of your questions during Q&A about why he's so excited about joining Align.","Let me now turn to our third quarter results. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear Aligners and intraoral scanners. David will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and open up the call to questions.","Q3 was a solid quarter with revenue, margin, and EPS each above the high-end of our guidance. Our results were driven by record Invisalign case volume, up 20.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all customer channels and geographies as well as continued demand for iTero scanners. The Q3 North American Clear Aligner volume was up slightly, 0.9% sequentially, consistent with historical Q2 to Q3 norms, and up 14.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, North American orthos were up, driven by teenage cases which increased 20% from Q2, and contributing to another record quarter for ortho utilization. This was offset by North America GP volumes which were down sequentially, primarily due to a seasonally slower period for GPs as well as weaker dental market.","The GP channel remains challenging, particularly among low volume practices. On a year-over-year basis, North American ortho volume was strong and GP growth rate was solid, especially considering tougher 2015 comps. We believe North America still has a lot of headroom for growth as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, including new products and technology innovation, evolving our go-to-market approach, and leveraging the TFM model that has been so successful in EMEA, and rolling out new Teen initiatives, including a new consumer campaign next year. In the GP market specifically, we're working to scale two very successful practice development programs led by key opinion leaders, increasing our focus on DSOs and large group practices. And in October, we began piloting Invisalign Go, our new product engineered specifically for GP dentists, with full commercial launch in the second half of 2017.","Q3 Invisalign volume for international doctors was roughly flat, 0.5% sequential, driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific offset by summer seasonality in EMEA, especially in Southern Europe where doctors and their patients typically take extended holidays. On a year-over-year basis, international Invisalign volume was up 33.8%, reflecting continued strong performance across both EMEA and APAC. In EMEA, Q3 volume was up 27% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign in core markets like Spain and France as well as rapid growth from expansion into new country markets including Eastern Europe, Benelux, and Nordic regions. In Asia-Pacific, we had another record quarter with volumes up sequentially and up 44.3% year-over-year led by China and Japan. Most APAC country markets had record shipments including China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia markets. In addition, we continue to see positive industry response at major events across the region, including the Guangdong (06:33) Ortho Society Meeting, one of the biggest in China.","During Q3, we announced multiple innovations that enhance Invisalign treatment planning and predictability of treatment outcome. Invisalign G7, which we announced in October, builds on earlier Invisalign G-series releases with new features to fine-tune certain tooth movement and deliver excellent treatment outcomes that doctors expect, especially with Teen. We also announced ClinCheck Pro 5.0, which has new features that deliver an exceptional user experience and new visuals along with increased control for doctors during treatment planning. Finally, we are very excited to announce our new one-week wear recommendation for all Invisalign Teen and Full products. Based on the predictability of the Invisalign system and our experience as well as patient case data shared by our customers who have been prescribing weekly aligner changes, we believe that for most cases, one-week wear can deliver shorter treatment times for patients and greater efficiency for Invisalign practices.","Turning to the Teen market, 162,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign over the past 12 months, an increase of 21% compared to the same 12-month period in 2015. For Q3, the total number of teenagers using Invisalign increased 19% sequentially and up 17.4% year-over-year driven by continued adoption worldwide. In Q3, we saw a strong uptick among teenagers using Invisalign outside the United States, up 36% year-over-year, with strong growth particularly from Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 51% of the total international Teen cases.","For North American orthos, Q3 Teen volume increased about 14%. It was lower than expected and not as robust as Q3 last year when we ran several Teen-specific promotions that drove incremental Teen volume. Q3 will serve as a good baseline as we head into next year where we intend to launch a major Teen program and a new direct-to-consumer campaign with greater investment in targeting teenagers more directly than ever have before.","While we're pleased with our Q3 results, our incoming case receipts in North America were lower than expected. We believe case receipts were impacted primarily due to a weaker dental market for GPs as well as a lack of Teen promotional activity for orthos. Today, with more than a month into Q4, I'm pleased to report that our North America case receipts have since improved and the demand outlook appears solid. David will provide more details in his business outlook.","Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA, and APAC leverage traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. Consumer interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. In Q3, we celebrated a major patient milestone and launched a global social media and advertising campaign to promote the London-based 4 millionth Invisalign patient. We promoted this milestone as a part of our partnership with Operation Smile with Align Technology donating $1 to Operation Smile for every public share of a photo of a person's smile on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with a #4millionsmiles for a total donation of up to $1 million. The #4millionsmiles campaign has been a great success in driving region awareness of the Invisalign brand around the globe and with this hashtag being seen over 51 million times around the world.","In North America, we saw positive gains in our consumer engagement and conversion metrics including web traffic conversion, doc locator searches and consumer opting for more information on treatment. In September, we partnered with the AAO at the start of New York City Fashion Week to highlight the best fashion accessory ever: a great smile as a result of Invisalign treatment. The Invisalign brand was a primary event sponsor and created an Invisalign lounge experience to showcase the power of a confident smile through Invisalign patient testimonials, iTero scans and consults with New York City area orthodontists.","In EMEA, our consumer outreach focused primarily on our #4millionsmiles campaign and the launch of the patient experience program in the U.K. market. This program is aimed at helping Invisalign providers create an excellent patient experience and includes learning modules aimed at practice staff to help them discuss Invisalign treatment with prospective new patients. In Asia-Pacific, our consumer marketing campaigns are focused on demand generation in key markets including China, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. In China, for example, our big bang consumer outreach program has focused on consumer engagement through Invisalign providers and social media KOLs, or key opinion leaders. This campaign delivered a 380% year-over-year increase in consumer web traffic and is on track to deliver 150,000 lead generations behind this campaign. We'll also continue to see traction in our Australia Teen campaign.","In Q3, our Scanner business revenues were up 35% sequentially and up 274% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter, primarily in North America. Demand for the iTero Element scanner has stabilized. At the recent ADA meeting in Denver, we announced new software upgrades for our market-leading iTero Element Intraoral Scanner and Invisalign Outcome Simulator. Only iTero scanners provide an optimized Invisalign scanning and treatment experience that includes the enhanced Invisalign Outcome Simulator 4.0 application, now with Invisalign 3D Progress Tracking and Patient Simulation Sharing.","The 3D Progress Tracking feature gives Invisalign providers the ability to compare a patient's new scan with a specific stage of ClinCheck treatment planned to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy-to-read color-coded tooth movement report that allows the doctors to know how each tooth is tracking.","Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand. The Q3 total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner worldwide increased 39.6%, which reflects a record 48.4% from North America and 22% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our own iTero scanner, we're also seeing some uptake from 3M's True Def and Sirona's Omnicam scanners. We also completed the final validation process for 3Shape's TRIOS scanner, TRIOS Standard, TRIOS Color and TRIOS 3, in which Invisalign providers with a TRIOS scanner can now submit digital scans as part of the Invisalign case submissions.","Now, I'll turn to the supply agreement we announced in July with SmileDirectClub for the emerging doctor-directed, at-home aligner market. Our agreement with SmileDirectClub is to manufacture non-Invisalign aligners for simple cases, which include up to 20 sets of aligners with no IPR attachments and are produced with an off-the-shelf polymer material. On October 15, we began accepting cases from SDC and subsequently started manufacturing aligners. We also recently implemented the Invisalign referral process for sending patients whose case falls outside the scope of the agreed upon SDC protocols to Invisalign providers and began scheduling Invisalign consultation appointments. While this is still early, we are pleased with our initial progress and remain excited about the untapped opportunity to help provide access to treatment for consumers who wouldn't otherwise seek orthodontic treatment.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our third quarter financial results. Total company revenue for the third quarter was $278.6 million, up 3.4% from the prior quarter and up 34.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $243.7 million was flat sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in Clear Aligner volumes. Our year-over-year revenue growth of 22.9%, reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies as well as our price increase in international markets.","Note that this past July marks a full year since we implemented the Additional Aligner policy, and therefore, our year-over-year comparisons no longer reflects the impact from this policy change. That said, our results still, however, reflect the impact from the grandfathered cases that were under the previous policy. Q3 ASPs were flat from Q2 at about $1,285, reflecting a slightly higher mix of Full and Teen product, the partial impact of the international price increase, which were offset by several factors including higher product discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 ASPs were up $26 primarily due to a price increase this year, partially offset by higher product discounts.","For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 177,800 cases were flat sequentially reflecting growth from our North American orthos and APAC region offset by seasonality across North American GPs and the EMEA region. Year-over-year case volume growth was 20.5%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volumes was up 3.8% sequentially and up 18.2% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume was down 2.7% sequentially and up 9.8% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was down 0.5% sequentially and up 33.8% year-over-year reflecting continued expansion of our customer base as well as increased utilization.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q3 was 5.0 cases per doctor, up from 4.7 in Q3 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 11.1, up from 9.9 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.0, slightly up from 2.9 in the prior year. And international utilization was 4.9, up from 4.6 cases per doctor in Q3 last year, driven primarily by increased utilization in EMEA. In Q3, we added 2,615 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,300 of which were new North American doctors and 1,315 of which were new international doctors. This compares to 2,885 in Q2 and 2,260 in the same quarter last year. Our Scanner and Services revenues for the third quarter was $34.9 million, up 34.7% sequentially and up 273.7% year-over-year.","Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.1%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year, both primarily attributable to a larger percentage of Scanner and Services revenue which carries a lower margin than Clear Aligner. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 77.7%, down 0.9 points sequentially and down 1.1 point year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by a higher number of aligners per case, partially offset by seasonally lower training. The year-over-year gross margin decrease was primarily driven by a higher number of aligners per case, partially offset by higher worldwide ASP. Q3 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 57.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially and 42.4 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases in gross margin were primarily a result of higher ASPs and the lower manufacturing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to its prior version.","Q3 operating expenses were $147.1 million, up sequentially by $7 million or 5%, primarily due to payroll and other costs related to increased head count, higher depreciation as we started to depreciate our newly-implemented ERP system, as well as post go-live support costs, but those should be decreasing over the short-term. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up $27.6 million or 23.1%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in our go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of the business.","Our third quarter operating margin was 22.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to slightly lower Clear Aligner gross margins, a higher mix of Scanner revenue, which while I mentioned achieved record performance, carries a lower gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. On a year-over-year basis, increased operating margin primarily reflects lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue due to volume leverage achieved on our year-over-year growth. With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 18.4% compared to 23.2% in Q2 2016. Our Q3 tax rate was lower by approximately 5 points due to a one-time benefit from our new international corporate structure, which we implemented in conjunction with our ERP.","Commencing in the third quarter, we also began including our relationships with SmileDirectClub in our reported results. While we didn't actually commence shipping product to them until the current quarter, our equity investment in SDC requires that we report our proportionate share of their losses. Our share of that loss is reported below operating margin and our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee. This Q3 loss net of tax was approximately $0.5 million. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.63 compared to $0.62 reported in Q2 and $0.34 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, for the third quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $245 million, up approximately 27% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 78 days, up 14 days sequentially and year-over-year as a result of our new ERP system and other related systems that impacted the timing of some of our customer collections. We would anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several quarters as we work through these changes. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $17.3 million, primarily related to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, and to a lesser extent our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $59.8 million, and free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $42.5 million.","During the quarter, we concluded our previously announced $50 million accelerated stock repurchase with final delivery of 143,310 shares and purchased an additional 88,000 shares amounting to $8.2 million in open market repurchases. These repurchases were collectively part of a three-year $300 million stock repurchase program announced on April 23, 2014. In addition to the April 2014 repurchase plan, Align also announced on April 28 of this year a new plan to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of the company's stock. There remains approximately $341.8 million available for repurchases under these two existing stock repurchase authorizations.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long term investments, were $675.8 million. This compares to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, a decrease of approximately $2.9 million. Of our $675.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $288.3 million was held by the U.S. and $387.5 million was held by our international entities. Our U.S. balances were up $107 million quarter-over-quarter, of which $147 million was contributed a result of implementing our new international corporate structure, which was then reduced by our investment in SDC of about $47 million. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of our equity method investments for SmileDirectClub was $46.3 million.","With that, let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook, as Joe mentioned in his comments, our incoming case receipts in North America in Q3 were slower than we had originally anticipated, and given in our targeted turnaround time to our customers, we shipped much of our backlog as of quarter end. Since then, our case receipts in North America have improved and returned to a year-over-year growth rate early in the quarter that is well ahead of both our second and third quarter performance. As such, our outlook for Q4 appears solid. However, lower Q3 case receipts and less backlog will dampen our Q4 shipment growth rate as our backlog begins to naturally return to normal levels. As such, our Q4 guidance reflects this impact. On a longer term basis, we remain confident that our Invisalign revenue growth on a full year basis will be within the upper half of our long-term model range of 15% to 25%.","With that backdrop, for our international markets, Invisalign demand remains strong and we would expect Invisalign volume in Q4 to be up sequentially driven by growth in EMEA coming off a seasonally slower summer period. APAC is usually seasonally down sequentially coming off a strong summer. For North America, we would expect North America Invisalign volumes in Q4 to be flat primarily as a result of the factors I just described. For our Scanner business, we expect scanner shipments to be up sequentially as the iTero Element continues to penetrate the market.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 182,500 cases to 184,500 cases, up approximately 15% over the same period a year ago, reflecting continued strong growth from international but muted by the factors just described. We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $289.2 million to $293.9 million, an increase of 27.6% year-over-year and well above our long-term target of 15% to 25%. We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 74.7% to 75.1%, essentially flat sequentially, primarily due to an increased mix of Scanner business and lower margins and slightly lower Clear Aligner ASPs.","We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $149.6 million to $150.6 million, up quarter over quarter primarily due to increased head count, offset by seasonally less advertising and lower ERP post go-live support cost. Q4 operating margin should increase sequentially and be in the range of 23.0% to 23.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 22%. We estimate the Q4 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction will reduce diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.5 million shares exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.67.","Before I turn the call back over to Joe, I want to say a few things about my decision to retire and spend more time with my family. This is something my wife, Nikki (27:20) and I have thought about and planned for some time and communicated to Joe. This timing has afforded Joe and the board time to find a replacement for me before I step down. I want to thank many of you who I've worked with and come to know well over the past few years. It has been a pleasure working for such a great company, and I feel honored to have been a part of history in the making as we transform and modernize the orthodontic industry. But it's not time to say good-bye just yet. Although John will start this week and I will hand over formal CFO responsibilities immediately, I will work closely with him in the coming months, and you will see us together at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings.","Until then, let's turn the time to Joe for his closing comments and then open the call up for your questions.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, David. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q3 results, especially the continued strength from our EMEA and APAC region. Notwithstanding weaker-than-expected North America case receipts in Q3, our business remains solid and on track. Based on the high end of our Q4 guidance, the implied full-year results will be significantly higher than our original outlook provided in January with 28% revenue growth, 20% Clear Aligner volume growth, and 23% operating margins. We have a huge opportunity in front of us to replace wires and brackets and transform the orthodontic market. As we continue to execute on our strategic plans, I'm confident in our ability to outpace the market and achieve revenue growth for 2016 and beyond at the upper end of our target of 15% to 25%. Looking forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various conferences and industry meeting.","I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, hi. This is Jack (29:33) on for Steve. Just a question looking at the trends in the business. Clearly, the Scanner business is doing very well. The Aligner franchise not going quite as strongly as we thought into 4Q, obviously with some of the weakness in North America. But I'm wondering if there's anything going on with the sales force and if there's a bandwidth issue at all there with Scanners drawing so much attention? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jack (29:59), it's Joe. I'd say the definitive answer to your question is absolutely not. We obviously watch that closely to make sure that we primarily focus on where the focus needs to be by sales rep. And I'd also just take a difference with your initial comment as I think the overall Aligner market continues to be strong. We had little bit of a speed bump in third quarter from an order standpoint. It's mainly GPs, low-submitting GPs that we've talked about before. But overall, in the forecast that we've given you for fourth quarter and fortunately given the timing of the call today, we get a good clear October look. We're very confident to be on the upper-end of our 15% to 25% revenue growth that we've been indicating over the last 18 months or so.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's good. And just on the one-week aligner policy that you introduced about a month ago, just curious what doctor uptake has been like so far, and how quickly you might expect that to start to become the norm? And I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, as we mentioned in the release, many doctors were already experimenting or were actually utilizing one-week wear, not just in North America but all over the world. So many are just continuing with what they were doing. Overall, we've had a very positive response. Again, we leave this in the doctor's hands. There are some cases, we don't think majority of the cases at all they might have to move to two weeks at some point in time, but we feel by far the majority of our cases could go with one-week wear with a lot of confidence in the teens market also in the sense that their dentition being looser and being able to move more quickly. So we're not predicting an immediate surge in orders based on one-week wear, but we think it's just another aspect of our go-to-market that makes Invisalign very enticing for patients versus wire and brackets. Okay, Jack (31:53)?","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Congrats on these strong results.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, so I guess just for us, you had a comment about the Q4 shipments growth rate and you're reflecting the backlog beginning to return to normal levels. Just curious to make sure that that should work itself through in the fourth quarter such that if the strong volume you saw in October carries over into early next year that we should mechanically then obviously see some improvement in the year-over-year growth as we go into early 2017. Is that the right way to think about that?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, just to back up on it. Yeah, we expect that to stabilize in the fourth quarter. That's why we called the shipment rates that we've been calling for you too. If I interpreted the second part of your question is as we move into 2017, should we be on a stronger footing in the sense of a backlog, that's our plan.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. So the backlog will not extend beyond one quarter, basically? That's what I was trying to clarify. So sorry for the poor wording the first time around, so.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Correct, Steve. It will naturally return to its nominal levels this quarter as our case volumes recover \u2013 case receipt volumes recover and as we're seeing early in the quarter so far.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, got it. Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe or David, as we think about the economic sensitivity of the Clear Aligner business, to what extent do you think we've seen any of that bleed over into the ortho channel? And not wanting to really split hairs here, but the EMEA growth slowed a little bit sequentially. To what extent, if at all, have you seen any I guess economic effects there in the core Western Europe market, if at all?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I'll let David join in on this too. I wouldn't call these any macroeconomic effects as far as what we're seeing right now. Your comment about bleeding over into ortho, we had record utilization rates in ortho, up significantly. I think it's 9.9% to 11.1% in the quarter. So it shows terrific continued growth in ortho utilization with our product line. So we feel broadly this is a GP blip. This has been talked about in the marketplace in the third quarter that we saw in North America across the board, not just with Invisalign but with the dental market in general. But, again, our October order rates indicate that we're on track with the kind of growth we experienced in the second quarter of this year. And we think that will continue to \u2013 go ahead.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, Brandon, just to add a little color to that. When we look at our GP doctors by segment in terms of the case volume that they do, the doctors that are fully engaged with Invisalign have incorporated into their practices are typically less susceptible to softness in the market because their practice have been built really around \u2013 Invisalign has become such an integral part of their practice that they typically are on the offense in terms of business development. It's really more the lower-tier doctors that are still quite dabbling in Invisalign, haven't quite changed their practice flows and so forth. And so when we see an overall softening in the market, it tends to be those doctors that tend to be the first to pull back. And when we look at the Q3, that's precisely where we saw it, really those doctors that are at the lower volume levels.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Then one more for you, David. Through the operating cash flow and the DSO build in the period, why would it necessarily take several quarters for that to normalize?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I hope it won't. We had a very successful implementation in July. We did have some delays in invoicing a few customers, and we're working through those right now and expect to have those worked out. When we sell to 30,000-plus customers at a time, it doesn't take very many to influence that DSO. And one of the things with most customers is when a sales tax rate or a VAT rate is incorrect, you typically wind up having to rebill the customer at the correct VAT rate or sales tax rate and then the clock starts all over again. And so we're generally up against that issue right there and we think over the next couple quarters it will be behind us.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one's got two parts, just one for Joe and David. So just to begin SDC, Joe, maybe if you can tell us what has been the Invisalign provider reaction to date? Anything surprised you on either the positive or negative side? And the second part of that question is for David. Anything on the 4Q 2016 revenue guidance on SDC? Since I believe, as you mentioned, they'll be shipping cases for the vast majority of the quarter. And then I've just got a quick follow up. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jon, it's Joe. Look, I think honestly the provider reaction to this was anticipated. I think you picked it up in your analysis, too, with the 100 orthodontists or so that you do. Many orthodontists aren't happy with this. Many of them understand why we did it. I think they feel good about it not being Invisalign, that it's GX30 (37:52) and it's a lip roll kind of a system and not a gingiva cut. That it's just really a complete offtake of what the product that they were using before.","Jon, so I think overall I haven't been surprised with the reaction. We haven't seen a response in the market that would be negative in some way. We're sitting here at the Ortho Summit, so we'll get on the ground feel here this week. But I would say overall good, because I think frankly there's an understanding in the marketplace of what we did and how we did this. That doesn't mean there's not a lot of passion about a doctor-directed kind of virtual model that exists out there. But we feel the response has been in line with what we had anticipated.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","And, Jon, to your second part of the question, really SDC didn't really impact any of our thinking as it relates to the Q4 guidance. When you look at our year-over-year growth that has been baked into our guidance, it really comes to two factors: one, which has to do with a renormalization of our backlog, if you call it that, coming off of Q3, a weaker case receipts; and then secondly, when you look at a year ago, Q4 of 2015, that quarter was up 25% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. And so it was just a rock-solid quarter for us. And so I think when you look at the compare quarter-over-quarter, I think you're seeing a comp there that's also having some bearing on it.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll follow up with you offline on that one, David. I guess I'm just wondering if you're recognizing revenue from shipping out the aligners, but I'll follow up with you offline on that one. The other one \u2013 just hate to burn one on Cadent, but I do think it's important. Just for 2017, Joe, how do we think about the scanner? And I'm just asking because it's a very different business than Invisalign, it's capital and you're coming off a big upgrade with Element. So just when we look at 2017, up, down, flat, specific to the Cadent business? Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","2017, Jon, just to be clear, up. I'm not going to give you a percentage, but it will be up. I think you can see with our announcement with our simulator product and things that we're putting together, this scanner's really important for us in the sense of how we go to market with the orthos but particularly with GPs also.","So think about that Scanner business as going up. Don't think of the margin being as dilutive as what we had talked about before as you put that in the model. Just think of it being almost equal to Invisalign in that sense. I'm going to let David backtrack here on the SDC fourth quarter piece and next year so we can just clear that up now with you, Jon. Okay?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. So back to that question, Jon, on SDC, very minimal revenue in our outlook this quarter for SDC. We really just got off, started in the middle of October. We're taking this very slowly as we integrate into their practice. So really a minimal consideration in the revenue guidance we gave for Q4. Very small.","Going back to the Scanner, I just want to highlight one other thing about our Scanner business. There's two components to that business, one of which has to do with the sale of the hardware itself, the equipment, but then secondly the ongoing revenue that we recognize associated with maintenance and subscriptions and so forth. That revenue grows in proportion to our installed base, and as you've seen this year, our Scanner growth rate from a unit standpoint is quite significant. So the installed base is building actually quite nicely. And so that's going to form a nice foundation I think for the Scanner business going into 2017.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, maybe following up on Jon's question, any other 2017 comments that you'd care to give us? You are certainly coming up against some very tough comps in terms of the Invisalign unit growth. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","John, I prefer not to give any more 2017 comments, but I think you can tell from my comments we're optimistic about 2017. We'll leave this year I mean obviously above guidance of what we gave you in 2016. Our international growth has been tremendous. Our ortho utilization numbers are good.","Coming up next year we have several programs with GP in North America that we think will address some of the weakness that we've experienced. Invisalign Go that we've put in place is a big one, some of our key opinion leaders and how they go about the GP market right now has really been incredibly successful.","Our TFM model that we're employing here in the United States not just in the ortho channel but the GP channel also, also gives us confidence that we can maintain that kind of momentum. But outside of that, I don't care to talk about any numbers and specifics, John.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one other follow-up in terms of your comments about the slower incoming case receipts. When did you start to see that? We've heard other dental providers talking about slowdowns as early as June. Was that strictly in September? Or did you see it start earlier in the summer?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So, John, it really began showing itself up in early July, and at the time when we were seeing it, we were thinking it just might be early seasonality. Even though we know that Q3 is a seasonally weaker quarter for GPs, a seasonally stronger quarter for ortho, particularly Teens, weaker seasonally EMEA, et cetera, that seasonality tends to move. And so sometimes it'll show up earlier or later. So in early July, we thought it was more just simply an earlier seasonality, and what wound up happening was it wound up being more seasonally weak, you might say, across almost the entire quarter.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Joe, just maybe one more kind of on the go-forward view, without maybe giving specific additional guidance on 2017. Can you give us a little more color or at least some of the things we should be thinking about as we refine our models for 2017, what puts and takes should we be considering on the cost side, whether it's mix shift, just things to bear in mind as you anniversary the ERP? Can you walk us through some of the things just to think about there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No, not really. Richard, we appreciate you wanting to fill out your spreadsheet for next year. We're trying to give you as broad a guidance and positive guidance as we can. But to really start to nail those specifics wouldn't be in line with the kind of information we normally devolve.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. When we get to the January earnings call for reporting year-end results we'll be glad to throw some meat on the bones, so to speak, to kind of describe our outlook into the year. But suffice it to say at this point, I think Joe's comments earlier about revenue growth and so forth and our long-term range, et cetera should suffice.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. And then maybe just \u2013 you put out there a confidence level to get to the kind of the upper part of your long-term range of 15% to 25%. Is that really just kind of the GP initiatives? Obviously some of the backlog normalizes, works itself out, but you are up against tougher comps this year. Should we just be thinking about that as really as these initiatives around kind of the GP segment? And then kind of marketing and new direct-to-consumer and Teen that are really kind of what give you the confidence there? Or is there something else? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I mean, we didn't have easy comps this year when you look at \u2013 we had easy comps on 2015 versus 2014. But this year we had a, Richard, pretty difficult comp even what David just referenced in the fourth quarter last year what a tough time we had. So look, I think when we talk about or when I talk about the GP focus that we're going to have, the international growth focus on teens next year, all those things are just to focus in areas where we develop products and systems over the course of last 18 months that go after those areas that historically have been some soft areas for us that maybe more unpredictable than they should have been. The rest of this business, the international parts, the ortho utilization piece, those things are going really well. Did we lose you? Richard, are you there?","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah. No. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just maybe one last one. The difference between \u2013 what is GP Go do for you that kind of prior initiatives haven't in the past? Maybe just elaborate on that a little bit. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Richard, basically GPs don't want to be orthos. They haven't been trained in tooth movements and when you look at products like we have, like ClinCheck and our full case assessments and those things, they are, as much as we want to make them, they are very sophisticated products. It's almost like using 90% of PowerPoint, which most people can't. And so with GPs what we have to do is build their confidence in the sense that they can look at a case and quickly say, I can do this case and I can do it well for my patient or I can't, and just in a short kind of a statement that's what Invisalign Go is. You can scan that patient or take a photo of that patient, we'll quickly assess that, we'll tell that particular GP if they can actually handle that case.","If they can, we can quickly work up a case assessment and give it to the customer while they're in the chair. It's a substantial difference than trying to in two days teach an ortho, I mean, a GP how to do ortho work, which is very difficult. We feel we can really integrate into a GP practice much more simply by making less complexity in a sense the way we do case assessments and the burden it would place on a GP to take that kind of burden. I hope that makes sense.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","It does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Hey, Joe. How are you guys? Let me start just by saying, David, best of luck in retirement. It's been great working with you for the last three years or so. So best of luck going forward.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate that.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. So, Joe, let me ask a couple of questions here. I mean, again, kind of like John I hate to burn a question on the Scanner business but it's been so strong here. You mentioned kind of that being up next year. If I look at your second half numbers here what's kind of implied in fourth quarter guidance and the third quarter strong result, it looks like you're up 50-some percent sequentially even first half to second half of this year. So not to pin you in a corner but kind of up year-over-year based off the 2016 base? Or do we keep seeing growth even off these low-$30 million numbers which are just well above what I think any of us were probably thinking they would be at this point?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","I mean, growth over the 2016 base, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","2016 base. Yes. No. That's helpful and then, David, maybe a clarifying question on the margin side. You made comments in your prepared remarks about margins. I think you said gross margin is down a little bit year-over-year, next quarter, and you said that aligner ASP is down. You kind of made reference to some bigger promotions here in this quarter. I guess, I'm trying to figure out why aligner ASPs would be down in the fourth quarter if you've anniversaried through the additional aligner thing. Now you've got price increases. You also have the positive mix if the backlog on North America is a little lower than the OUS backlog I would think \u2013 or the OUS growth I would think would be helping ASPs next quarter, so just trying to reconcile margins being down next quarter \u2013 gross margins.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay. So, for a couple of things, one, as it relates to Clear Aligner, our \u2013 well, more about ASPs, which will impact that. ASPs are affected by product mix, and our low stage products are very heavily concentrated or more so concentrated, you might say, from a mix standpoint in our EMEA region than the rest of our business. And so since Q3 was a seasonally weaker quarter for EMEA and Q4 is seasonally stronger, that mix of low stage product is going enter into the equation and is going to influence the ASPs this next year, it will go up. That mix is going to go up by 1 plus points quarter-over-quarter and that will have some bearing on it.","And then secondly, you've got doctors \u2013 this is the end of the advantage period for many of our doctors, and so as those doctors begin to get close to or approximate the next tier of their pricing, they'll begin to see lower prices, even this year early as they're running towards that December 31 date. So those two things right there are bringing down the ASP and bringing down very, very modestly the gross margin at the same time.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. That's helpful. And Joe, last question from me, I just want to make sure I understand clearly your comment on being in the upper half of that 15% to 25% range. I think you were talking Clear Aligners and you were saying get back to that by first quarter of 2017? Or is that just kind of a general comment getting back to that over the next few quarters?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, from an order rate standpoint, Jeff, we feel we'll be in that range in the fourth quarter. So as we move into the first quarter of next year, we feel that way and that is why I'm quoting, as you mentioned, Clear Aligners. This is not mixing Clear Aligners with the Scanner business.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks guys appreciate it.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Jeff. See you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question, please?","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question, Mr. Jones.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions, and David, yeah, congratulations on the retirement. John, look forward to working with you. I guess, Joe, just wanted to go back to something you had said about what you're seeing in case receipts quarter-to-date? Wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. It sounded like you're saying based on what you're seeing to-date you do expect to return to the type of growth, case growth that is, that we saw in 2Q as we move into next year? Wanted to be clear that, A, I heard you correctly. And B, are you talking specifically about North American GPs? Or was that a reference to overall North American expectation for case growth?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","The 20% that we're talking about is overall for the Clear Aligner business, is what we see right now in October for the entire business. We're seeing better North America performance than what we saw in the third quarter. I haven't specifically referenced if that was GP or ortho.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","And better than Q2 as well.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Better than Q2.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Better than Q2. Okay. Got it. And then I guess just on the international side, it does look like the 4Q guidance for international cases seems to imply a bit of a slowdown there on a year-over-year basis. Just wanted to see if you could comment on some of the factors at play, do you feel like you're reaching any kind of capacity constraints? Anything else as far as, how quickly you can go after that big international opportunity?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So Bob, our factory basically fabricates aligners on a first-in first-out basis and without really much respect for where those aligners come from. And so when we talk about our case receipts increasing this quarter and our backlog and factory WIP returning to a more normalized level, that cuts across all regions of our business. And so whatever dampening effect it has, it is across all regions. So that's part of the reason.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","On the case receipt side though, international is very strong and it continues to be strong. Nothing's really changed there on the case receipt side.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thank you Bob.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks Bob.","Operator","There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Shirley Stacy of Align Technology. Ms. Stacy, you may now begin.","Shirley Stacy","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Joining me today is Tom Prescott, President and CEO; and David White, CFO. We issued third quarter fiscal year 2013 financial results press release today via market wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com.","Today's conference call is also being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 12 months.

We encourage listeners to review these items.","We've also posted a set of GAAP and non-GAAP historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our third quarter conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'd like to personally welcome, David White, our new CFO, to Align. I'm excited to have him join our executive team. For those of you that haven't met David yet, he started the 1st week of August just after we reported Q2 results. He's hit the ground running and he's quickly coming up to speed in our business.","On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our third quarter results and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanner and CAD\/CAM services, including some color on our customer channels and geographies. David will share more detail on our Q3 financials, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for Align, with revenue, gross margin and EPS higher than our outlook. Further, we achieved record levels of revenue, Invisalign case volume and North America iTero scanner volume, enabling us to reach the low end of our long-term model for our operating margin, while generating strong operating cash flow.","The third quarter includes the seasonally slower period in Europe and North America for our GP dentists, along with the peak of the summer season for teenage orthodontic case starts. We're pleased that patient traffic appears to have remained solid for our North American ortho customers this summer, which resulted in strong sequential and year-over-year growth for Invisalign volume, especially in the important teenage patient segment.","For Q3, total Invisalign case shipments increased to nearly 107,000 cases worldwide for the first time. Year-over-year growth was driven by continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased Invisalign utilization. Improvements in product and technology over the past few years, including our new SmartTrack Aligner Material, are helping build even greater clinical confidence so our doctors will utilize Invisalign more often and on more complex cases.","Doctors continue to give SmartTrack Aligner Material high marks on performance, with 78% of doctors surveyed agreeing that SmartTrack supports better clinical outcomes.","SmartTrack Aligner Material also recently received the Top 100 Product accolades from Dentistry Today as the winner of the 2013 Pride best-in-class award, which will be presented at the upcoming ADA meeting in New Orleans in 2 weeks.","Future results also reflect solid growth from iTero scanner and CAD\/CAM services business.","I'll start with a quick recap of a few key metrics for Invisalign, covering utilization, training and teenage ortho market penetration. But rather than going to a lot of detail here, I recommend that you reference our Q3 earnings slides posted on our website.","For Q3, total Invisalign utilization was 4.3 cases per doctor, a slight decrease from Q2 at 4.4, which reflects an increase in utilization by North American orthodontists, offset by North American GPs and European doctors. This is consistent with the seasonally slower period for these customers and geographies.","In Q3, we continue to expand our base of Invisalign providers, adding 90 North American orthodontists, 705 North American GP dentists and 840 international doctors for a total of 1,635 new Invisalign doctors.","During the quarter, total teenagers treated with Invisalign increased to 28,900 and had a year-over-year increase of 18% and a sequential increase of 23%.","For North American orthodontists, Q3 case volume of 41,600 cases increased 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting continued increases in utilization, along with some contribution from new orthodontist submitters. These results reflect our continued focus on driving adoption and utilization of Invisalign into the very important teenage orthodontic market.","While we are still assessing the market data from the summer teen season, we believe we gained some teen share of overall orthodontic case starts.","For North American GP dentists, Q3 Invisalign case volume of 38,500 cases increased 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an expanding customer base, along with increased utilization. On a sequential basis, GP case volume was down slightly as expected given the seasonally slower summer period for most GP practices.","For international doctors, Q3 Invisalign case volume of 26,800 cases increased 22% year-over-year and was down modestly from Q2 as expected, reflecting summer holidays for our customers, especially in the southern European countries.","We continue to see strong volume growth for our Asia Pacific region, which was up sequentially and year-over-year. That strong volume growth in Asia-Pacific came from our traditional direct country markets of Japan and China, as well as our new direct country markets in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Collectively, this region continues to represent a great growth opportunity for Align.","For Japan, Q3 was another record quarter for Invisalign volume. Strong growth was driven by the continued increase in the submitter base. We're also seeing positive trends in teen submissions, as a result of expanded training for Japanese doctors on the Invisalign teen product, which began in July. Product innovations like Invisalign G4 and SmartTrack really hit home in the market like Japan where the cases are very complex.","For China, Q3 was also a record quarter, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Invisalign volume. These results reflect continued good execution of our strategic investments over the past few years. The China team continues to deliver outstanding clinical education, provide high-impact clinical and customer support and facilitate peer-to-peer advocacy, all of which support our strong progress. Much of this effort is being helped by key opinion leaders at the premiere government hospitals and orthodontic and dental schools.","As the dental market evolves in China, access to dental care is expanding. Fueling part of that expansion is the increasing number of clinics serving the growing middle class. Align is now working closely with a number of these high-quality operators that are actively marketing Invisalign to consumers. These clinics understand the value of the Invisalign brand and are working to make Invisalign a significant part of their practice.","On an overall basis, in our direct coverage Europe region, case shipments increased in this region by 20% year-over-year led by Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Across the region, we've seen an increase in clinical confidence in our product, along with further expansion of our customer base and increased demand for shorter, simpler treatments. These trends, combined with our continuous investment in education and customer experience improvements are contributing to great progress for Invisalign in Europe. All country markets demonstrated a strong year-over-year growth for Invisalign case shipments, with the exception of the U.K., which decreased slightly compared to Q3 last year. While our team in U.K. continues to work against some economic headwinds, we are seeing some initial signs of recovery among orthodontists in the UK.","Turning to our consumer program, late in Q2, we launched a new fully-integrated consumer advertising campaign in North America and Q3 was the first full quarter in the market. The Better Smile Everyday campaign continues our focus on women and moms and teenagers and it's launch was timed to coincide with the busy teen orthodontic season, which runs from late spring to the start of the new school year. We're pleased with the strong early metrics from the campaign, which combines TV and digital advertising, with social media and traditional media relations. Web traffic at invisalign.com continues at an all-time high and that's a strong indicator of consumer awareness and interest in Invisalign. And as result of great editorial coverage in key outlets such as Lucky magazine, Marie Claire and Working Mother, our year-to-date print and online media impressions are at an all-time high. Over time, we expect to convert this awareness and interest into patient starts in our customers' practices.","Let's now shift to our scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment, where we had a record quarter for scanner shipments in North America. We're continuing to build our scanner installed base. And by our estimates, we are growing faster than our competitors. These results reflect the selling leverage we are gaining for major Invisalign customer events such as the Invisalign GP Summit held in July, as well as Invisalign orthodontic forums, a key clinical education event held throughout Q3. This progress and the feedback we continue to receive from iTero customers supports our belief that we have the best scanner with the greatest utility in the industry.","An important part of our scanner business strategy is to improve the customer and patient Invisalign experience through the use of scanners to replace PVS impressions. We are definitely seeing leverage as our case submissions from digitally screened -- digitally scanned impressions continue to increase consistently.","As of Q3, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scan rose to 25% in Q3 compared to 22% in Q2 and 13% in Q3 a year ago. Doctors, staff members and especially patients are all happy about this trend, as they see faster cycle times, better aligner fit and a far better experience.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q3 financial results. David?","David L. White","Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the warm welcome. It's great to be here at Align on my first earning -- quarterly earnings call, especially after such great results.","Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis.","Now with that, let's review our third quarter results.","As Tom mentioned, our revenues for the third quarter amounted to $164.5 million, up slightly from the prior quarter and up 20.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter clear aligner revenue of $153.5 million was relatively flat sequentially and was up 21.2% year-over-year.","Sequential revenue growth was driven primarily by seasonal strength in the North American Ortho market, which reflects a 27% sequential increase in number of teenage cases in North America. This was offset somewhat by a decrease in international cases and lower international ASPs. North America ASPs were flat.","Our year-over-year growth reflected higher Invisalign volumes across all geographies, channels and products.","Turning to our third quarter scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment. Revenue was $11 million, half of which related to scanners and the balance of which related to services. This represented a 4.1% sequential increase and a 12.1% increase year-over-year. Third quarter scanner volume was up 32% over the last quarter, which reflected record volumes in North America.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Third quarter gross margin was 76.0%, up sequentially half of a point and up 2.4 points over a non-GAAP gross margin reported in the same quarter last year.","Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 79.9%. This was up 1.5 points sequentially and up 2.3 points when compared with gross margin reported in the same quarter last year. The sequential increase was a result of 2 primary factors: First, a more favorable product mix shift to higher-priced products; and secondly, as a result of updating our midcourse correction policy last quarter, we expensed a modest increase in mid-course correction cases and a corresponding reduction in our warranty claims. This necessitated a modest true-up of our revenue deferrals and warranty reserves, which actually resulted in a reduction in our overall gross profit of approximately $1.1 million. However, the impact on gross margin was favorable by about 0.7 points.","The year-over-year increase in gross margins primarily reflects higher ASPs, resulting from our price increase, which was effective at the beginning of 2013 as well as the aforementioned impact from the change in our mid-course correction policy.","Q3 gross margin for scanners and CAD\/CAM services was 22.2%. This compares to 33.9% in Q2 and non-GAAP gross margin of 21.6% in the same quarter last year. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower scanner ASPs as a result of a reduction in the list price of our current scanner, combined with the promotion to sell our older scanners, as well as higher manufacturing costs. Our year-over-year improvement in this segment -- segment's margins was primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by lower ASPs.","Q3 operating expenses were $83.6 million. This was down $2.2 million sequentially as a result of fewer customer events in the quarter as well as less media cost. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $12.7 million, incidental to the growth of our business, as well as the impact of the medical device excise tax levied on our U.S. revenues.","Our third quarter operating margin was 25.2%, up 2.1 points quarter-over-quarter and up 3.6 points when compared to a non-GAAP operating margin reported in the same quarter a year ago.","With regards to our third quarter tax provision, results for the quarter benefited from a one-time tax credit of $1.3 million related to a true-up of our 2012 federal income taxes.","Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.42 compared to $0.36 reported in the same -- in the prior quarter, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.26 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. For the third quarter, accounts receivable was $109.2 million, down approximately 3% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 60 days, a 2-day improvement sequentially and a 10-day improvement over the same period a year ago.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.8 million. Cash flow from operations was $55.1 million. And free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures amounted to $49.3 million.","Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $400.4 million. This compared to $356.1 million at the end of 2012.","Now let's turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter's and the factors that inform our view. While typically the third quarter reflects the peak season for teenage orthodontic case starts, the fourth quarter is often a slower period for North American orthos, as fewer teenagers start orthodontic treatment once the school year has started. As such, we expect North American orthos to be down sequentially in Q4.","Offsetting this trend, our fourth quarter's historically been a stronger quarter for our international doctors and North American GPs as they rebound from a seasonally slower summer quarter. We expect volume for both international and North American GPs to be up sequentially in Q4.","Our scanner business performed very well this past quarter despite an increasingly competitive environment and we expect our scanner volumes to remain consistent with third quarter performance. Our strong Q3 results reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and our outlook for Q4 assumes this trend will continue.","With this as a backdrop, we expect our fourth quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 109,700 to 112,100 cases, reflecting a 21% to 24% year-over-year growth. We expect revenues to be in the range of $169.1 million to $173.1 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.7% to 75.3%, which primarily reflects higher training costs and mixed shift to lower-priced Invisalign products, that is less Invisalign Teen and more Invisalign Express.","We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $83.8 million to $85.4 million, which primarily reflects continued investment in products and technologies as well as continued market expansion.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 25.2% to 26.0%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 21% and diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 82.2 million. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.43.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, David. There's a lot of good work going on by the Align Technology team, and I'm very pleased to see our strong results reflect that effort. We continue to deliver solid execution of our long-term strategic plan and expect to continue those key initiatives, which are at the core of our progress.","Our results also reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and their willingness to let us become a more significant part of their practices. Our goal is to become their best partner in practice, providing great opportunities for growth, with every potential patient asking for Invisalign by name.","We look forward to seeing our investors during the busy time for conferences and industry trade shows as well as reporting back to you with our year-end results in January.","And with that, let's go to the -- with the question and answer session, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What a difference a year makes, Tom, David. Just looking at the ASPs, second straight quarter, where we saw some strong -- some support there on ASPs, actually some improvement across all the segments, I guess, could you talk a little bit more about the drivers of ASP and how we should be thinking about the pricing power going forward? Just really trying to figure out how much of this is a result of maybe comps versus an actual firming of pricing of your products in the market?","David L. White","Hi, Robert, this is David. I'll see if I can't answer that for you. When you look at ASPs, as we publish on the website and so forth, those are an aggregate ASP for the entire company. And so one of the things that you don't necessarily see in there is what impact mix has on that. And so as you look at, if you look our business quarter-over-quarter, our Teen business is up very strongly sequentially and that came at the expense of some of the lower-end products that carry lower ASPs. And so those -- that tends to -- that mix shift there tends to cause the worldwide ASPs sometimes to look a little bit off. As it relates to your question about the purchasing price or the purchasing power of our product and competitive pressures on our product, as you know, we made a slight increase in prices of our product at the beginning of the year. Some of that was a result of the new medical device tax and so forth. But at this point in time, we haven't really made any further adjustments on pricing since then. So the effect that I think you're seeing, from an external standpoint, has really more to do with mix shift than anything.","Thomas M. Prescott","And Robert, if I could just pile on, the slide that Shirley and the team have put in here, on the very last slide in our webcast slides really try to break out those effects net of mix. And if you look at that in general, I would say pricing is stable net of mix and other factors. And so it's not so much a comp issue. We're actually -- pricing is pretty stable.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just move over to the case guide, the 3% to 5% increase sequentially, seems like a big guide up, especially in light of some of the uncertainties that seem to be surrounding the consumer as we sit here in October, maybe more of a qualitative question, but was just wondering if you could talk a little bit of how you're factoring in some of the uncertainty in the marketplace and some of the pressures around consumer sentiment into your fourth quarter outlook?","Thomas M. Prescott","Let me maybe start and then may be a pull-up for David, since this is his first-cycle with us. I think his objective view might be useful here. But I guess what I'd first start with is that we have the same kind of visibility we always have in our business cycle, about 30 days or so. And what you're seeing is a fundamentally solid business today, with initiatives that are working for us. And I'd take you back to earlier in the year. We made investments exiting 2012 in headcount and coverage in our geographies: Europe, North America. We've made investments in new consumer programs. We spent a little more money. We've told our owners what we're doing purposely, our goal was to generate volume as we exit the year and we're starting to see that, so we're gratified by that. But it reflects what we're seeing in the business. And we're not smart enough to break apart all of the elements going on. But with that said, I think there's -- we've seen other data that patient traffic is stable to improving. Dental consumables are improving a bit. And when there's traffic in the offices, patients are willing to do a more expensive procedure, an implant, a restorative, then that means there that the road's wide open for us to get Invisalign growth. Maybe with that, I'll pivot -- let David build on his first-cycle here, preparing the guidance.","David L. White","Thanks, Tom. Robert, I guess I would -- when I first joined the company, I would've thought that given 25,000 customers that we ship to in a quarter, that forecasting the business would lend itself to some econometric model. But as you kind of look under the hood, what you realize is we have a small number of doctors that have a very healthy practice with us that is fairly stable and relatively predictable. But on the other flipside of that, we have a lot of doctors that do a small amount of business with us, and that particular segment of our business tends to be more difficult to predict. So when I look at the process and so forth, we have a process that kind of does a bottoms up view from the field, in terms of where -- what our territory managers and so forth are seeing as they talk to their customers. We have a view from the tops down of the company, which takes a look at our own statistical correlation of trends and so forth. And then as Tom was saying, we also look at patient traffic and so forth and some of these other external data points, and we triangulate across all of those to come up with our best view of the world. It's -- from what I can tell and, I think, from what some of you have experienced, it's not perfect. We'd like it to get better. But I think what I can tell you, at least from what I've seen and observed and so forth, is I think we have a robust process. And I'd say it's representative of best practices across many industries.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All make sense. Just a last one David, I'd slide in just on the back of that. Any thoughts, I know kind of early days for you, but any thoughts about extending the outlook that you guys do provide? I know it's something that us on the sales side and I'm sure investors would appreciate very much.","David L. White","Not at this point. We give a long-term operating model. I think our operating model is where we are steering the company towards and those are the results we're trying to head towards. So probably not at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","David, maybe just a quick follow-on to Bob's question. Any early thoughts on 2014? Obviously, you're not in the mode of providing full year guidance, but are there any kind of key issues that you think we ought to be thinking about that could be key swing factors, particularly around margins?","David L. White","Well, John, a pleasure talking to you again. I guess what I would -- what I've observed and, I think, what you've observed as well is our business does have some degrees of cyclicality in it. Our business, certainly, from a revenue standpoint, has seasonality. Q3 perhaps being the largest manifestation of that. But further than that, there's other elements of our business that had cyclicality to it as well. Our media expenses, for example, might run counter seasonal. Then we make investments in the business that sometimes tend to be bulky and done on an as-needed basis and are not -- don't follow a pattern of repetition. So when you look at our Q3 performance that we've just announced and our Q4 guidance, I guess, the thing I would comment on is that I wouldn't use those 2 data points to extrapolate going forward. Because of that seasonality and because those 2 quarters alone do not manifest, I think, all the cyclicality that our business deals with. I think more representative of that -- of our business, however, there's our annual operating results. And I think that's probably the best guide because our annual results include -- incorporate all of those cycles in them. As you think about, going forward, as I said on the prior question, our targeted operating model is 25 to 30 points. And I think at some point, as we get to being able to consistently land within that operating model, at some point, we'll then update the model. But at this point, I think that the best guidance I can give you is the operating model we've already talked about.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one last one and I'll stop. Could you give us an update on how realign is faring with the Henry Schein salesforce?","Thomas M. Prescott","I'll take that one, John. We're in very early days there. It is -- the Schein team and the Align team are working hard to ensure that the kind of the early customers and the field reps that are moving this have great experiences and we learn a lot from those cycles and make sure the product works perfectly for the patient. And Dr. Phil is creating the practice. So we kind of thought about the first year at startup. And we're right in the middle of that learning cycle, we're collectively about to head off to a trade show, the ADA, there's greater New York, there's some important cycles where Align will be out there in the market and Schein will be out there in the market, and we're going to have a chance to have that discussion with customers. So very early days, not going to be material for a significant amount of time, but way more strategic than kind of tactical. I don't know if that's what you're looking for. That's where I'll stop.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And are you still comfortable, Tom, that the margins on that product can be consistent with the rest of the business?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes. Short answer is yes. When we -- if we stack up the take out in marketing, professional marketing demand creation, go-to-market, our contribution margins will be similar to, on a net basis, similar to, say, an Express product for example, where we got direct sales and marketing involved.","David L. White","At the operating level.","Thomas M. Prescott","At the operating margin level, below gross margin for sure, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from Roth Capital Partners.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","First, I guess, Tom, you mentioned the North American Ortho case volume strength was driven partially by new ortho submitters. So I guess, can you just talk a bit more about what's driving those new orthos coming on board?","Thomas M. Prescott","It's really a couple of things. We've got more of those coming out of their graduate programs, maybe didn't get enough Invisalign in their program and as they're coming to a practice, they're very interested in, just trying to do Invisalign, that's 1. Two is we have some great established ortho practices that maybe got trained 10 or 12 years ago. I would say back in the early days, we weren't ready for prime time. They didn't have a great experience with the product. Couldn't address very complex needs. And as they've seen our progression, they have come to the view that they need to get on board. And so we've had a number of terrific kind of market-leading practices, want to reengage. In our mind, those are new practices, we haven't had business with them for years. And so that's the other part of the mix. Both are very positive, small numbers, but I think what's more important is what those kinds of practices represent over the next 3 to 5 years.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, just on the gross margin side for the fourth quarter guidance, it's down sequentially. I think, you had mentioned some product mix, lower-priced products there, but can you just discuss a little further what other factors might be planned into that? And then, longer term, as we look on to 2014, how should we think about that gross margin trend unit?","David L. White","Chris, let me see if I can give you a little color. As you look at our margins in the third quarter, they're, I think, almost a record, if they're not a record for the company, on the Invisalign side of the business. As we shift into Q4, however, though, we're going to see a lesser mix of you might say, the top end of our product line and that's going to get displaced with more volume in the lower end. So that mix shift is going to bring margins down to some extent. Then in my prepared comments, I made a comment that we had this mid-course correction that caused an adjustment to our deferrals, which is about 0.7 points of margin effect sequentially to Q3, but that's nonrecurring in Q4. And so we don't have the benefit of that in Q4. We also -- we'll have more training events this quarter. And when you -- we don't -- our training business is not an 80-point margin business. And so that will tend to drag the margins down a little bit as well. And offsetting those 3 is the fact that we -- is our scanner margins should improve quarter-over-quarter as well. And so the net of that is that margins should be down sequentially a little bit. As it relates to '14, again, I guess, the best guidance I could give you would be to look at the full year results, look at the trends, look at the -- and look at the operating margin, the targets or the business model that we talked about and I would plan off of those things.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And if I could sneak one more in. Tom, just going back to the visibility into the business, I was hoping you could talk about how maybe that's evolved over the past, say, 12 months. Seems like, I think, you're talking about improving that visibility in recent quarters, some office surveys and other initiative to gauge more of a month-to-month trend in patient traffic and other market trends. So how has that evolved over the past year compared to third quarter of last year? And then, how that contributed in the fourth quarter guidance that was given today?","Thomas M. Prescott","So I'll take my shot with -- while I'm knocking on wood, we're glad to have the positive results. I think, the starting point for all this is: A, we have the same kind of visibility we've always had in the core flow of the business; and then, B, our customers don't forecast, so asking them forecasting questions doesn't necessarily lead you to a factual framework you can count on. What is different, there are a few things different. The evolution of business this Q3 and Q4 from last year is fundamentally different. Patient traffic started declining in U.S. dentists office in the middle of Q2 last year, as we reconstructed all that. Procedures started falling with them, and mix shifted to lower value procedures, that really wasn't visible well into Q3 and we didn't really see it until summer didn't kind of bounce back. So that's different and that's why we keep stressing that stable to slightly improving patient traffic, mix in procedures is a really good thing for us. It's a good thing for everybody, but it's really good for Invisalign. To your second point about what we're doing differently, we do a lot more differently, a lot of things differently. When you get it wrong or you get humbled or you get surprised, you ask yourself a lot of questions about what can we do. Everything's on the table. We have instituted a whole series of what we internally call poll surveys. And it's not so much of forecasting, I just call it observational. We haven't been at that even a full year yet now in detail. And I would say we're far short of predictable kind of results. Our goal over time is going to be able to correlate some of that with other external factors like patient traffic. Empirical data we can observe. But boy, we're well short of what I'd call predictive capabilities. So what is reflected in our outlook, what is reflected in our results is good execution of business and everything we can control and a very solid environment out there in the countries that matter for us. And then, maybe the third fact is we have this very low penetration for Invisalign into a pretty big darn space and we still have a lot of headroom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder, Tom, if we're far enough along that you could give us a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing with SmartTrack? Have you been able to get a view of what kind of impact that's having in practices that were maybe early adopters or beta testers, any discernible or hopefully quantifiable impact on how the mix of ortho cases there is impacted in terms of the percentage of cases that are going to Aligners in those practices?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. Simple answer is for the most frequent users of Invisalign, including some of those that were in the pilots, even a year before we released, and others that just see, most quickly see the benefits, they have virtually all expanded case complexity and gotten most of the benefit out of it. We are still, I would say, working through our complete customer base. For a customer that does, even a great orthodontist that's only doing 10 or 15 a year, it's taking them longer to see the benefits because they generally are treating simpler cases. And they're just -- they don't have the at-bats that a high-volume doc doing 200 or 300 Invisalign cases a year would. But on those higher volume practices that are -- their progression has been towards greater complexity and earning a bigger part of their practice. And they say kind of yes to Invisalign more often when that patient asks, that's the short answer.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there a case for 5 points of mix shift over some horizon, can you quantify any of this for us?","Thomas M. Prescott","It's not -- I wish it was as simple as that. We actually have some internal ways we measure it. And we look at the kind of the incidences, what presents with a -- at an average orthodontist or dentist office for the malocclusion and put them into categories, and then we look at what that incidence is and then what they treat against that mix. That same chart varies widely by the practice and how much they've adopted Invisalign. So we have 2 things. In our most ardent supporters, we get the biggest chunk of their Class 1 crowding cases, adult and even teens. And again, teens are harder cases to fill because everybody's aiming for absolutely perfect. And if they think they're making any clinical tradeoffs, they're going to be more resistant using Invisalign. But at least for adults, we're doing very well there. As you get over towards more straightforward Class 2 or even hard Class 3, the doctors that have got the greatest confidence and have had the greatest results with Invisalign are much more comfortable offering that to an adult patient. So there's a temporal framework that goes along that opportunity. The least frequent users are the least penetrated to those indications would be most around Class 1. And the most frequent users who have the greatest confidence are doing it on much more complex cases. So it's not as simple, I'm sorry to say, I wish it was, to say there's a projection of growth or share, but both are being driven by evolutions like SmartTrack and G4 that give us both greater confidence and because they're getting better results with those tools.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then, as my follow-up, I wonder if you could give us an update on your thinking around partnerships in the world of inter-oral scanners. I wonder if there's any new thinking there? And I wonder, now that you have a relationship with Henry Schein that's expanded, if that might be a gateway, if some of the Henry Schein partnerships might be more logical for you? And then, I'll drop.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. Thanks, Steve. The update is when there's news to talk about for interoperability, we will be happy to do so. We think it's strategically valuable. You saw we keep going up around 250 to 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter in cases coming, just with the iTero base among our customers. And we know there's interest out there. So it's in our best strategic interest to have those partnerships and you ought to assume that we're interested in doing that. But until we get there and can actually validate appropriate high quality scanners, I don't want to project.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you help us think more towards gross margins and specifically, when we think about the contribution of fourth quarter and out in the '14 for more value-oriented product offerings like Express 5, how do we think about that in combination with the ramp of Realine, which I realize is still in early days right now, but assuming it has to become a bigger part of the mix, how do we kind of weigh that when we kind of think forward on the gross margin guidance? And I have a quick follow-up.","David L. White","Yes. Again, we've had a few questions about 2014, and I guess, it's not surprising given our results in Q3 and Q4. As Tom said earlier, as it relates to Realine, it's really too early to call, to put a vector on that and to give any guidance as it relates to how that product will impact overall mix. As it relates to gross margins, we've continued to comment, I think, that as we look over the long term, that the percentage of cases that we treat, particularly for simple cases with adults and so forth will increase, and that will potentially drive down margins -- drive down ASPs, I should say. And clearly, our margins are influenced by product mix. But given that we're still growing well into double-digits year-over-year, while that may have some bearing on the directional indicators for margins, these gross margins, I don't think they'll necessarily have an indication of an effect, I guess, on operating margins. So going back to, I guess, the comments I made before, I think the best guidance for '14 is, again, going to be our operating model that we talked about.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. When we think about the scanner business, 22.2%, I believe, the gross for the quarter, could you give us a feel there in terms of the mix, what's being placed versus what's actually being sold into the channel and how that may or may not be changing?","Thomas M. Prescott","I'll see if I can take that one, and David can pile on if he wants to. First of all, the reported gross margins are nowhere near where we want them to be or where we expect to get them over time. If I understood your question, in terms of new systems going in versus services stream, was that the question?","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Thomas M. Prescott","I think, we spoke about roughly half and half in terms of the mix of services against new scanner placements.","David L. White","I would just add to that, as our scanners -- as we continue to penetrate the market with more and more scanners, that mix should go more favorably towards the service and licensing sides of that over time.","Thomas M. Prescott","With higher margins.","David L. White","Over time with higher margins.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","If I could, Tom, just to follow on or to clarify that, when the actual system is placed, is the system sold outright or they placed early on, on a volume commitment, I'm just trying to tease out why the margin's at 22%?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, the margin's at 22% because our build material and cost of goods, we have the best scanner in the market and we don't make money on them. We -- and with pricing that has come down over the last 1.5 years, 2 years, with a lot of competitive entries, we've met that pricing, pricing is actually stabilizing a bit in the scanner market, have raised -- coming up a little bit. And we do think scanners will be ubiquitous. We think it's critically important for us to be at chair-side in the middle of a clinical discussion with the patient right there, and then, creating advantages for our Invisalign franchise and other things we intend to do over the long term. So with that said, the gross margins aren't anywhere near where we want them on the scanner. We intend to fix that over time. The services stream is better and we think we've actually got some strategic advantage there over time. But it's just the build material that's expensive, and it's the best scanner in the market, which is a kick, but we'll fix that over time.","David L. White","Yes, and just to add to that, as I said earlier, just to make it maybe clearly, state it more clearly, that service element should grow against -- it's in proportion with the install base, and not in proportion to the number of systems we're selling in any particular quarter. The other thing, as you talk about the 22% gross margins in the second -- in the third quarter, some of that was also the result of the fact that we were selling, under promotional programs, some of our older scanners. So that had -- that promotion to kind of move some of that inventory had a dampening effect on margins in the third quarter and that's one of the reasons why the margins in that business should be up in the fourth.","Thomas M. Prescott","Chris, I just realized, I didn't answer a part of your question. You were theorizing maybe there was placements instead of sales, we really don't do that. So those are all sales. Whether there was a financing involved, we don't finance either, but whether it was financed for us, it was a net sale, period.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All of my questions have largely been answered here, let me just ask one, Tom. I want to make sure I understand the timing comments on the DTC, I was surprised, your DTC spending may be down this quarter, I know it had kind of flared up in the second quarter as you launched some of these new programs. And so is that just kind of a normal kind of ebb and flow of that spending? How are you thinking about maybe DTC spending given that it seems to be generating some nice top line, how are you thinking about that spending over the next several quarters to couple of years?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. I think, as David was talking about, the broader issue of the timing and mix of spending isn't always in the same cycle with volume expansion given cyclicality, seasonality et cetera. And the example, I believe, was summertime is typically our strongest media, traditional media, digital media, everything else. And it's often a softer quarter, given the seasonality, people out on holiday in Europe, and certainly in North America, where we advertise most. So in general, there is a general consistency to our program spending on consumer and that is light in Q1, heavier exiting Q1, stronger into Q2, setting up for the summer season, heaviest spending exiting Q2 into the summer, and then pretty strong through all the summer, slowing as we exit Q3 into Q4. And you probably shouldn't see us by the time Christmas advertising is on in general just because there's so much noise. That is -- and now there's a whole -- there's a parallel mix of digital PR. Again, this integrated campaign, if you see for every TV commercial that you might see on one of the -- Bravo or one of the channels we work with, there's probably 10x that activity through multiple other platforms, whether it's Pandora for radio, whether it's gaming and other things. So that's the visible part in traditional media on TV. But again, there is generally the same profile for that spending in North America. Does that get at your question?","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that does. And I guess, last year, you had obviously some timing shifts or some fall off probably to that normal cyclicality, just given the Olympics and that, but I would assume, looking forward, nothing on the horizon we need to be thinking about that might shift that timing, at least in the near intermediate term?","Thomas M. Prescott","The Winter Olympics is nowhere near the media frenzy of Summer Olympics. We don't have an election year. There's a lot of things that you have to engineer around in the media world. This should -- I don't know what normal is in the dental industry but if we had to imagine a normal, this feels like more of a normal. Now the second thing is we were off the air a bit more exiting '12 because we were getting ready to launch a whole new campaign. And I think, when we spoke about our guidance in January for the year, we were talking about investing in new assets, a creation of new creative and materials and all the associated elements that go along on the digital side and everything else. So all that, that's where the spending was, it wasn't necessarily visible media that was part of the first half year -- first half of the year profile in greater spending. So again -- but in general, you should expect stepwise expansion investment and the same kind of impact that we expect to get for payback year-to-year.","Shirley Stacy","Operator, we'll take one more question, please -- we'll take 2 more questions, we've got time for 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","David, just curious if you could give us an update on where we stand on the NOLs and when you expect to have to begin paying cash taxes, whether that's anytime soon?","David L. White","So I'll say, we do pay -- I'll be clear here, we do pay some cash taxes. Typically, those are in foreign jurisdictions and in states here in the U.S.. As far as our U.S. federal return is concerned, we do have NOL carryforwards. And currently, today, obviously, we're making money here in the U.S.. Those taxes, however -- that income, however, though, the taxes on net income, we do have the benefit of R&D tax credit, which offsets that to some degree, we also have the benefit of stock exercises and the ability to deduct some of that off of it. And so it means that we use up less of our NOL than what we might have otherwise in the absence of those credits. Altogether, our estimation is that our NOLs will probably run sometime into or through around 2015.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, just one more for you, given this is your first conference call as the new CFO, I would be curious to hear your view around how you think about capital allocation and share repurchase in general with cash building on the balance sheet pretty substantially here?","David L. White","Well, I guess, I would say, philosophically, that if a company is accumulating cash and doesn't have a need for that cash to either grow its business and just to run the business, then at some point, there should be a plan to figure out how to return that to shareholders. That said, we just finished here in line, as I'm sure you know, $150 million stock repurchase plan in the June quarter. 95 -- $93 million of which was spent in that quarter. And so we just completed one of those plans. We haven't really quite come up for air yet. I would tell you that as we kind of look at our annual plan for next year and our 5-year strategic plan, we are right now pulling together what we think our investment requirements are going to be for the company. And clearly, those investments will, at some point, are going to mean added manufacturing capacity, market expansions, we're going to have both domestic needs, as well as international needs. And at this point, we haven't really assimilated how all that's going to fit together. But at some point, we will in the not-too-distant future here. And to the extent we come to a conclusion, at least with the board, that we have excess cash that we don't need as a company. We'll figure out what plan we're going to do with it. But right now, as of today, we're just not ready to declare what that next step will be. But I think, if you can be patient with us, we'll probably have more to say about that in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of John Block from Stifel Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe I can just slip in 2 or 3 questions. I guess, the first one, on the investment side, and I'm also guessing people are going to stop asking if you're staying by your long-term margin guidance, on the investment side, you've done a ton in the past 12 months, APAC, you've added North American reps, you did some work in the international side, and then you're starting to obviously post a leverage. I think, in the past, the spend has been very lumpy. And so, Tom, can you just speak broadly about incremental investments from here, maybe not detailing what exactly they're going to be, but again, will you pull back at all, will they be as lumpy as they've been in the past? Any color would be great.","Thomas M. Prescott","I guess, I have to start with the word lumpy. From our perspective, the business cycle itself here in the dental industry is cyclical. Maybe use that instead of lumpy. And in many areas, these investments, it doesn't make sense to line up investment choices that are multiyear in nature and have a strategic value to fit them perfectly, maybe fit them generally, yes, but not fit them perfectly into that kind of annual cycle we see. Q3 being a great example of one that's softer. So where we choose to make investments that during a quarter or 2 would take operating margins down a little bit, as we did in Q1 when -- or into Q2 as well where we talked about it with the yearend results in January of this year, we also made the commitment that we expected to be able to generate volume growth. And I think, David said it well earlier, we think looking at the model, in terms of our annual performance is the right way to look, and so the question is going to be we know that's not how you have to model on a quarterly basis and the reports you put out, but from our perspective, we're trying to deliver an annual result with the quarters that make sense, and some of the spending, an example is consumer is going to be in advance of that volume step up. And in this case, this year, it was also on top of substantial headcount investment that we had all completed by end of Q1. All that headcount was in North American sales force on an incremental basis. And you had virtually none of the volume was coming in yet. We had a new media camp, a new consumer campaign going on yet, with very little impact felt yet. So that's great examples of where it's the right thing to do and the timing is better to get at it quickly and get it in. So simply stated, I think, we will continue to be a little more cyclical in our total operating margin profile. But where we are on the lower side of that, I believe we'll continue to articulate what the spending is going towards so that our owners can understand that the kinds of things we're investing in, we have high confidence will lead to either increased earnings, in the case of the right kind of factory, or increasing volume, and ultimately, operating margins on an annual basis.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just shifting gears over to teen, it was up 18% year-over-year and it looks like some of that was a little bit lower on teen growth from GPs. It's certainly good numbers, but it's a second quarter in a row where you sort of had a decel into the mid to high-teen level, and then it goes mid-20s in 2012. So I'm just trying to find something to pick on. I mean, what do you think about growth in teen going forward? You mentioned, hey, they're looking for perfection. Is SmartTrack starting to give them better conviction that they can get there with Invisalign? Again, any thoughts would be great.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. If this is the only thing we've given you to pick on, I'm really happy as CEO. Look, first of all, we're thrilled with the progress we're making. We've said for a long time that earning that marginal teen case is the hardest case to wrestle away from brackets and wires, which is still standard of care. So we have to be better than brackets and wires in many ways. And we're getting there. Now I think it was a question earlier that I answered, that was comparing where each practices and their adoption and their clinical confidence, a practice that uses a lot of Invisalign in adults and teens doesn't seem to worry about it. They'll lead with Invisalign. A practice that's more conservative that is just now maybe starting to get SmartTrack is just now starting to get more complex crowding cases on adults. And so our goal is over time, is to move practice by practice, this progression through and have them see that experience firsthand, have the patients be thrilled, get those great results. And that just reinforces their own journey. So it's literally that practice by practice process that we're encouraging. On a numbers basis, we get big enough. The denominator gets tougher, 18%, 21%. We're in the right neighborhood and we're thrilled with the process. SmartTrack is a big part of that, G4, all the rest of it. We can't do enough consumer advertising if the product -- if they're not confident the product doesn't work. So the right coverage in clinical education and clinical support, the right product evolution and the right consumer, those 3 legs of the stool go together really well for the teen market and we're very confident over the mid to longer-term, our goal is frankly to become standard of care in orthodontics. The teen market is the last place, we'll get there.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question, if I can just jump in there David, this might be for you. International ASP, and those slides are helpful, but international ASP looked like it was down sequentially despite what I believe was an extra month from APAC in a euro that went in your favor. So what am I missing on why international ASP would just be down Q over Q?","David L. White","Well, you're right to pick up on foreign exchange. I mean, that was a benefit to us, about $1 million in the quarter. But again, back to the comment I made before, when you look at these ASPs, it's an average across the mix of products that we're selling. And so, when that mix changes, the ASP can come down, even though -- you can point to examples where the price on every single product could go up quarter-over-quarter, but if the mix changes, the overall could look like it's going down. So there's really no trend there that I think you should be concerned about. It's really more of a mix shift than anything else, I believe.","Shirley Stacy","Well, operator, that concludes our formal comments today.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today I'll provide some highlights from the quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, care aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the first quarter and I'll offer some commentary on how we see the 2017 unfolding. Following that I will come back and summarize a few key points and then we'll open upto questions.","Q4 was a strong to the year with revenues at the high end of guidance, up 27.3% year-over-year resulting from better than expected Invisalign and iTero volume, primarily in North America offset by lower ASPs, discounts and FX. Q4 Invisalign case shipment increased 6.9% sequentially reflecting an uptick in North America and EMEA, and was up 18.5% from the prior year driven by continued growth across all geographies and customer channels. Our iTero business also finished strong with scanner units up 27.7% sequentially and 171% compared to Q4 a year ago. EPS was $0.59 which was lower than our outlook primarily due a $0.08 impact from exchange rates on a strengthening U.S. dollar that John will explain further in his comments. ","By all accounts 2016 was a terrific year for Align. We exceeded $1 billion in annual revenues for the first time in our history. We had more than 700,000 adults and teenagers store [indiscernible] with Invisalign care aligners and we more than tripled our shipments of iTero standards to nearly 4,000 units. All while delivering several new products expanding our global footprint in operations, establishing a new doctor direct-to-consumer channel, the small direct love and implementing an entirely new ERP system without any major business disruption. For Q4 North American Invisalign volume was up 5.7% sequentially driven by expansion of our customer base and increased utilization from both customer channels.","During the quarter, North America Orthos gained momentum following our Invisalign Summit in November. And North American GP growth was driven by both Invisalign Full and Express family of products. On a year-over-year basis, a shipment growth of 15.2% was driven by continued adoption by North American Orthos has seen a record utilization and solid growth from GPs, especially with Invisalign Express. We continue to make progress with the Dental Service Organizations or what we call DSOs, the fastest growing segment of the dental industry which represents nearly 20% of the market today. In Q4, roughly 8% of our North American volume came from DSO practices and they outperformed private practices significantly, both in terms of growth rate and ortho utilization.","Q4 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 9.1% sequentially driven by strength in EMEA coming off Q3 summer seasonality, offset somewhat by seasonally a slower period in APAC. On a year-over-year basis international Invisalign volume was up 25% reflecting continued strong performance for both EMEA and APAC. In EMEA, Q4 volumes were up 20% year-over-year reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign in core market led by the UK, Spain, and France, as well as continued rapid growth in our expansion markets of Central Eastern Europe and Nordic. We also saw initial momentum with a successful launch of IGo. Our Q4 EMEA shipments do not reflect the strong underlying demand as our reported growth rates were dampened by the imbalance between receipts and shipments that we described in our Q3 earnings call. As our backlog in fact returns to more normalized levels in Q4, there was a dampening effect on the shipment that cut across all regions because the lines were fabricated and shipped on a first-in, first-out basis without regard to geographical regions, notwithstanding this EMEA still had a record quarter.","In Asia Pacific, Q4 volumes were up 35% year-over-year led by China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. During the quarter we held numerous clinical education and training events across the region. In China more than 1,000 doctors attending an Invisalign Day at the China Orthodontic Society's Annual Meeting. In Japan we held Invisalign Forum with more than 200 doctors in attendance, and we participated in the Taiwan Association of Orthodontists meeting for the first time. We also successfully transitioned from indirect coverage in Korea to direct, our largest beauty\/cosmetic surgery market in the world is in Korea. During the Teen market, or two-fourth of the total number of teenagers using Invisalign decreased 7.7% sequential as expected due to the seasonality and was up 19.7% year-over-year driven by continued adoption worldwide. Q4 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for teenage start. For the full year 169,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, an increase of 19.6% we compared to last year. The International teen case starts represent about 30% of total teen starts and grew 31% in 2016 when compared to last year.","Our results reflect solid execution of our strategic approach drivers which includes international expansion, driving ortho utilization of Invisalign, especially among teens, helping GPs treat and refer more patients; and lastly, ensuring that billions of potential patients that we generate through consumer demand program are offered Invisalign treatment. Product and technology innovation are key to all these initiatives and in 2016 we continue to see increased clinical confidence as a result of innovation in Invisalign treatment for customers worldwide. Q4 was a particularly busy quarter with product releases designed to improve feeder [ph] predictability, outcomes and efficiency. We launched Invisalign G7 with features that helped us to fine tune certain tooth movements and we launched the latest version a ClinCheck Pro for more flexibility in treatment planning. We also announced upgrades to our iTero Element scanner, software the Invisalign Outcome Simulator chairside app, adding 3D progress tracking to help assess Invisalign treatment progress and finding with a recommendation of many of our most experienced doctors and our North American Clinical Advisory Board, we issued a recommendation for weekly aligner wear and Invisalign Teen cases. But we are now recommending one week wear for Invisalign Go.","Innovations like our G-series features and smart-track material give doctors' confidence that they can get the result they want with Invisalign while changing aligners weekly instead of every other week. It's a real improvement in treatment efficiency and a better experience for patients to reduce overall treatment time.","Our integrated consumer marketing program where we're just traditionally in media search and digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point and consumer purchased security. Consumer interest in demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. In 2016 there were over 8 million unique visitors to Invisalign website; 1.8 million potential parents searched an Invisalign provider on dock locator which is up 38% from 2015. And Invisalign social media community grew 50% to 530,000 consumers [ph]. In Q4, our scanner business revenues are up 19.3% sequentially and up 157% year-over-year reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter, approximately 27.7% quarter-over-quarter, primarily North America. Usually iTero scanners from Invisalign case submissions in place of EDS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner North America increased to a record 51.3%, up from 48.8% in Q3 and 39.7% in the same quarter last year. While these scanners were predominantly from iTero scanner, we also are seeing some uptake for [indiscernible] which were previously qualified for the Invisalign case submission.","Q4 was our first quarter supplying aligners for Smile Direct Club. We continue to work closely with Smile Direct Club theme developing processes around the manufacturer of their aligners and continuing to ramp our efforts in the referral cases to our network of orthodontists and dentists for in-office Invisalign treatments. The potential this new entirely market, new market force is large. While the business is going to [indiscernible] we remain very excited. I'd like to update you on our plans to expand our operations globally and get closer to our customers local market. This past July we transitioned our order acquisition operations which is the digital scanning of the cemented TBS impression for the EMEA region, we move it to Amsterdam. We focused initially on moving the order acquisition process because of the huge customer experience benefits which faced several days for initial ClinCheck turnaround time.","Order acquisition has a low labor and training component and is therefore relatively easier to relocate. We also get immediate net cost savings for COGS or costs of goods sold from the lower freight costs. While still early, we're already seeing these benefits from having operations in the region. We're planning to establish order acquisition for the APAC region in Singapore and expect to begin processing incoming Invisalign cases for that region in early 2018. Our first treatment planning operations outside of Costa Rica and our first aligner fabrication operations outside of Mexico will both be located in the APAC region. We are focusing on Asia Pacific first because of the diverse customer needs of that region, language and translational challenges, and a significant distance in time zone differences that currently results in more time for ClinCheck turnaround. The China market will be our initial focus for treatment planning operations in APAC and be located in Chengdu, China. We expect to begin processing Invisalign cases in Q2 2017. A location for our APAC aligner manufacturing has not been finalized yet however, we plan to be operational in the first half of 2018.","We plan to establish our operations in EMEA in a similar way. We have treatment planning operations in Cologne, Germany starting in Q3 2017 followed by Spain in the first quarter of 2018. We're building more detailed plan for putting treatment planning and the other core markets in EMEA over the next few years. International expansion of Invisalign value chain which includes order acquisitions, treatment planning and aligner fabrication is on the way. I'm excited about the opportunity and the potential to being closer to our customers. Our operations are very flexible and we see so many benefits that will allow us to scale with our business and ensure that we offer the best customer support experience.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on our patent litigation. At the conclusion of the International Trade Commission action against ClearCorrect in September 2016, we filed a motion in federal district court in Houston to lift the stay that had been in place since the filing of the ITC action. The court granted our motion and the matter is now active and we are proceeding aggressively, relying in part on these prior findings of infringement and validity from the ITC proceedings. In addition, today we announced that we have filed a new lawsuit against ClearCorrect and Your Smile Direct LTD of Dublin, Ireland, for patent infringement in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom. We believe that ClearCorrect is now infringing Align's European patents by offering its aligners to consumers through Your Smile Direct and to practitioners through it's own distribution throughout the United Kingdom. The ITC already found Align's U.S. patents to be infringed by ClearCorrect and we will continue to assert and defend our intellectual property rights against infringement, both in the United States and internationally.","With that, I'll now turn it over to John Morici.","John Morici","Thanks, Joe. I'm very pleased to be here. Let's review our fourth quarter financial results. The total company revenue for the fourth quarter was $293.2 million, up 5.2% from the prior quarter and up 27.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis our reported Q4 revenue was reduced by approximately $3 million, both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.","Fourth quarter clear aligner revenue of $251.5 million which now includes both Invisalign and Smile Direct Club aligner revenue was up 3.2% sequentially reflecting growth of Invisalign volume partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs. Our Q4 shipment volume and revenue to Smile Direct Club were immaterial to the quarter. Our year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 17.5% reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customers' channels and geographies. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $50 to -- from Q3 to about $1,230 reflecting higher promotional activity and the impact of foreign exchange rate. On a year-over-year basis Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down approximately $20, primarily due to promotional activity and again, the impact of foreign exchange rates which was partially offset by price increases. For the fourth quarter total Invisalign shipment of about 190,000 cases were up 6.9% sequentially refracting growth primarily from our EMEA and North American customers. Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was 18.5% driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 3.2% sequentially and up 20.2% year-over-year.","For North American GPs, case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 9.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year reflecting continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased utilization. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q4 was a record 5.2 cases per doctor, up from 4.9 in Q4 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 11.3, up from 9.9 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.2, slightly up from 3.1 in the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0, flat from Q4 last year as we continue to expand our customer base. In Q4 we added 3,700 new Invisalign doctors worldwide of which 1,420 were new North American doctors and 2,280 of which were new international doctors. This compared to 2,615 in Q3 and 2,670 total doctors trained in the same quarter last year. Note that the total number of doctors trained in Q4 includes 670 Invisalign Go doctors in EMEA that were recruited over the course of the year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $41.7 million, up 19.3% sequentially and up 156.8% year-over-year.","Moving on to gross margin; fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.1%, flat sequentially and up 0.1 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.5%, down 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to lower Invisalign ASPs partially offset by cost leverage from higher volume. Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.4 point year-over-year primarily due to increased aligner's per case as we continue to treat more complex cases. Q4 gross margins for our scanner segment was a record 61%, up 3.9 point sequentially and 23.2 point year-over-year, both the sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower manufacturing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to our previous scanner. Q4 operating expenses were $151.9 million, up sequentially by $4.8 million or 3.2%, primarily related to increased employee headcount which was partially offset by lower media cost and foreign exchange rate impact. On a year-over-year basis Q4 operating expenses were up 33.8% reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activity, each critical to the growth of business.","Our fourth quarter operating margin was 23.3%, up one point sequentially and down two and half point year-over-year. This sequential increase in operating margin related primarily to OpEx leverage from higher volumes and revenue. On a year-over-year basis decreased operating margin primarily reflects higher OpEx as we've grown into business. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, Q4 operating margin was minimally impacted by foreign exchange rates as we have a natural hedge between our revenue and operating expenses. With regard to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 19.8%, up by approximately 1.4 point compared to Q3 of '16. Recall that Q3 was benefited by a change in our corporate structure as part of our ERP implementation.","Commencing in the fourth quarter we also began to find aligners to Smile Direct Club. Revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reported results although they were immaterial to the company. Additionally, we also report our share of Smile Direct Club's losses below operating margin in our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee, net of tax. This Q4 loss, net of tax was approximately $1.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.59 compared to $0.63 reported in Q3 and $0.60 reported in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter EPS was unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar which amounted to approximately $0.08 per share, primarily due to the net realized foreign exchange losses related to the revaluation of certain balance sheet accounts addressing unrealized foreign exchange losses included in other income and expense.","In conjunction with the implementation of our new international corporate structure in July we changed the function of currency of our Netherlands entity from euro to U.S. dollars. As a result, monetary balance sheet accounts are revalued into U.S. dollars and any impact from that is charged to the P&L. Prior to this change these impacts were charged to the balance sheet. We have now changed our processes to limit our exposure and the impact of these kinds of currency movement which we believe should not have nearly as large of an impact on earnings going forward.","Moving on to the balance sheet, as of the fourth quarter cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investment were a record $700 million. This compared to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $21.3 million. Of our $700 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities, $241 million was held by the U.S. and $459 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $247.4 million, up approximately 1% sequentially. Our overall DSA -- DSO was 76 days, down two days sequentially and up 14 days year-over-year. The year-over-year increase is a result of our new ERP system implemented in July 2016 and other related systems that impact the timing of our customer collective. As we indicated last quarter, we anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several quarters as we work through these changes.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $81 million and free cash flow for the quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to a record $66.8 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $14.2 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases or additional manufacturing capacity as well as building improvement. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $38 million under that April 2014 repurchase plan. Subsequent to year end we completed this plan, we purchasing the remaining $3.8 million. We still have $300 million available for repurchased under the 2016 repurchase plan which we announced last April.","Before we move to Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2016 results. In 2016 we shipped a record 708,000 Invisalign cases of 21.5%. This reflects 32.4% volume growth from our international doctors and 16.4% volume growth from our North American doctor's. Shipments of iTero scanner were up more than three times over 2015 to nearly 4,000 units. Total revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 27.7% year-over-year. Full year operating income of $248.9 million or 23.1% of revenue, free cash flow was $177.1 million. For the year we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Align stock for $96.2 million. In 2016 diluted EPS was $2.33.","With that let's turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with demand outlook; for our international market expect seasonally slower period for APAC with the Lunar New Year and for EMEA with winter holiday and vacation. For North America, seasonally up GP and Ortho. For our scanner business, Q1 capital equipment purchases are seasonally lower. With this as a backdrop we expect the first quarter to shape up as follow; Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 200,000 to 203,000 cases, up approximately 22.2% to 24% over the same period a year ago reflecting continued strong demand across all channels and region. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $295 million to $298 million, an increase of 23.6% to 24.8% year-over-year with gross margins in the range of 74.2% to 74.5%. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $162.5 million to $164.5 million, up quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the increased headcount and increased marketing expenses. Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 19.1% to 19.3%.","Regarding our tax rate; at the start of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update entitled improvements to employee share based payment accounting under this new standard excess tax benefit and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as paid in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement for the reporting period in which they occur. Under this new standard we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 1% to 2% which includes $12 million in extra tax benefit. We estimate the Q1 impact of the Smile Direct Club transaction will reduce earnings per share by $0.01 per diluted share, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.3 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 which includes approximately $0.14 of excess tax benefit.","Finally, it should be noted that our Q1 CapEx will be larger than normal as we recently entered into a purchase agreement for the new -- for our new facility in San Jose, California. Accordingly Q1 CapEx should be approximately $70 million to $75 million.","Now let me turn our view to the full year. We anticipate 2017 revenue growth to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at or above midpoint of that model. As for our scanner business, recall that 2016 revenue and volume growth significantly benefited from the unfilled backlog carried over from 2015. And while we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2016. We expect operating margins to be flat to slightly up over our 2016. Those investments will include geographic expansion both in countries and markets we already serve, as well as expansion into new territories including Latin America and India. And aggressive direct to consumer advertising campaign targeted directly at teen, international expansion of the Invisalign value chain including order acquisition and treatment planning to get closer to our customers as Joe mentioned.","Commercialization of several new products including in class two and tubular [ph] advancement feature for international markets, Invisalign Go for North America and new iTero scanner features and functionality, and implementation of the CFM model in North America and APAC which was previously rolled out in EMEA. We believe these investments are key to the continued customer adoption and acceleration of our growth. Similar to last year, many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful return. We expect the equity loss from our investment in Smile Direct Club would be two to three times the 2016 losses we recorded. We expect our tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 18% which includes $19 million of excess tax benefit.","Finally, as typical, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than in the first half with second half operating profit to account for somewhere in the range of 56% to 58% of our full year results.","With that I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph Hogan","Thanks, John. In closing, I'm pleased with our continued progress but behind all this progress and hard work, what we've really done is to build on the original vision and work started 20 ago this year, and that has created digital way to move [indiscernible] predictably, comfortably and statically and we're doing that. Digital is the future of what Donek [ph] which means all season in future will be moved digitally throughout.","We have good momentum and energy heading into 2017, something we all felt that they are still waiting to kick-off at the year in North America, APAC and EMEA. We have a lot to be excited about with new products coming to treat younger patients and solutions specifically for general dentist, expanded opportunities through Smile Direct Club and our new consumer campaign to much more. I look forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various financial conferences and industry meeting. Before I open the call to questions, I want to take a minute to welcome Lin [ph] who will join Align on February 27 in the newly created position of VP, Americas.","This newly created position for the Americas region will allow us to provide greater focus on each region, respond to their different needs more quickly and effectively and harness to collective power of our largest market in the world. We've never had one leader for the region with our expansion in Brazil and greater Latin America, we thought it was time to bring all these activities in the Americans under one leader, just as we have in EMEA and APAC region, this is an opportunity for us to add an executive with experience who is going to help us scale and continue to grow. I know that she'll be an excellent addition to our team.","Lastly as we announced in Q3 earnings, David White, will officially leave Align in February. I want to thank David for as many contributions to the company over the past three years and which him the best is his retirement.","With that we'll now open for any questions you might have. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Thanks, Joe and welcome John. So I guess you know looking at the results, despite what appears to be somewhat of a softening overall dental end market, you guys were able to post and forecast strong case growth. So I guess Joe big picture question, I guess how important is the overall foot traffic in particular in the GP office relative to how you think about referrals and growth of Invisalign?","Joseph Hogan","You know I think you can never negate what traffic, I mean it's important that you have -- store traffic in that senses point of view there. I mean witness what happened to us in the third quarter and obviously from a GP market segment we saw that decline so I think what you're seeing here is, you know GP did come back kind of from a seasonal standpoint we expected that as we indicated in our forecast. So also you see this ortho utilization really picking up in a big way also. So I think those two combined variables but I mean to specifically answer your question, so what traffic goes down 20% in ortho, this is going to affect us in one way or another but a continuation of 2016 into 2017 is what we're projecting when you heard with forecasted -- I think that's why we're still bullish in a sense of as we look at 2017.","Robert Jones","Got it. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you know, you guys called out higher promotional activity as driving the decline in the ASPs and I know you guys run promotions often but I don't remember it being this big of a drag on ASPs. Can you maybe just give a little bit more detail on the promotions you ran and should we expect this level of promotional activity to continue as we think about '17?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, I think you know, when you -- look Robert, we have some promotional activity but obviously nothing would have been outline as what we've done in the past and fourth quarters except there is one 75% -- $75 bonus that we gave to the orthodontic community that came through Las Vegas. And we saw a pretty big uptick from that thing. And so you know, that hit us a little bit from an ASP standpoint but held volume but then we had some FX and some mix in here also. So it was a good balance in that central [ph].","Robert Jones","Got it. Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good afternoon. Joe, on -- in terms of the '17 outlook first on the top line, can you give us a sense of what you're embedding for FX impact to the top line as well as the ASP trends for the year? And then when you look in the middle of the P&L you outlined a number of initiatives; can you help us size or put some numbers to the relative sizes of each of those initiatives, each of the cost buckets in terms of the incremental commercial spend?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, I'll take the FX and ASP. You know we've set our plan for 2017 based on current FX rate, so we've adjusted to what we're currently seeing and that's what's in our guidance. And as far as ASPs, we expect them to be flat to slightly up as we plan for 2017 from that standpoint. And then from a spend standpoint we're continuing to invest in our sales and marketing organization and specifically on the marketing on the direct to consumer and really targeting that team market. So it's a continued investment that we're making in 2017.","And as we think about this from year to year is, you know we've done the last few years in this business, we really hit the channels hard in a sense of hiring sales people, seeing the international growth that we have. Just to look at our business next year is doing exactly the same thing; we're running the same plays maybe to a higher degree because we have higher momentum and higher volumes to deal with. So real added cost is our team focus these for next year, you know that will be anywhere between $10 million and $14 million but I would say that's the inordinate kind of change from your year that we would have had versus our normal kind of OpEx extension that we feel -- you know, I mean that's why we struggled so much in the first quarter in a sense of it could be lowered all these investments so we can realize those in the second half of the year.","Brandon Couillard","And just curious about you think about the potential risk of a board of tax on Mexico imports? And any -- let's say mitigation efforts that you could take to perhaps offset that? And could you update on the exact mix of how much of the production is coming out of Mexico today? Is it 100% of the volumes?","John Morici","Well, I mean out of everything our production right now is slowly and whereas in Mexico, and 60% of our production goes to North America and 40% goes overseas. Now you're asking me to comment on Trump's comments, I don't know which tweet you want me to address. I'd say all those tweets have different financial scenarios. Part of it also is going to be reduction of the corporate tax rate, it looks like it's come together maybe the 20% range or so; so it's really hard -- it's kind of washed that's been out right now. What I want to give investors' confidence that we're aware of it, and we'll make the new kind of changes from a flexibility standpoint, we could be nimble on what new to be done. But the last thing I'd say is, you know our Mexican facility, I don't want it to be looked as the low cost facility, this is an incredibly high tax credit -- incredibly important aspect to us and so we've invested tons of money over 20 years to bring this as a modern day production facility, it's the biggest 3D printing business in the world. This is really a valuable asset for us and we'll do all we can just to make that asset as productive as possible regardless of what we see.","Brandon Couillard","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Bouchard [ph] of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions everyone. I wonder if we could reflect just for a minute on the first quarter guidance when I think back to the company's approach to guidance over the years, that there has been -- you know, there have been times when we thought well, you know, the guidance could have been a little higher but the company has pretty steadfastly stuck to this view of looking at past sequential trends, seasonal trends to say, okay, here is where we think the business is going to grow. When I look at the first quarter though, the guidance for the sequential volume growth -- significant -- relative to trend, stronger than normal trend; so I wonder if you could spend just a minute there -- kind of clue us into anything we might be missing about what might be different this time around?","John Morici","Steve, this is John. I think what we saw -- we saw a very good volume in Q4 and I think that's what led to strong shipments and strong revenue performance in Q4 and we've seen that continue into January and into 2017 that we feel very good about where we're at from a volume standpoint and that's why we've given the Q1 guidance and it helped strengthen where we think we're going to be at for 2017.","Unidentified Analyst","As you look back at order patterns over the last several months, do you think it might have been in part more of a timing issue where new orders were delayed upto the latter stages of the year and into January?","Joseph Hogan","I think you got to look at Q4, Q1 normal list -- you know how -- there is some seasonality in a sense of how we go about things too. So I hope we're answering your question but I know what you're saying is we're probably a little outside of what -- kind of guidance we've given in the past. I'd just take John's comments in this specific momentum but also your understanding of the seasonality that says the Q4 to 1Q is the two main variables and why we're predicting that Q1 to be what it is.","Shirley Stacy","Just a final on Steve, I -- do you recall a few -- the order imbalance that we referenced on the Q3 call that -- you keep in mind right that strength carried over, [indiscernible] which is the received strength obviously carried over as the inventory and backlog, even down in Q4 and that strength obviously has carried over to Q1.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Now last one for me\u2026","Shirley Stacy","This was actually Steve -- I think you even said something about this on the last earnings call you asked whether this would carry over into Q1 and that's potentially what you're seeing.","Unidentified Analyst","Well don't give me too much credit Shirley.","Shirley Stacy","We won't give you credit for the strength but --","Unidentified Analyst","Last one for me. I wonder if you could give us any early reflections on the traction you're getting with the one week change out; how broadly are you seeing that adopted if it's something you can pick up from your friends in the channel? And what are the -- what's the early feedback or clinicians thinking about this as in any way changing the way they go about using Invisalign? Thank you.","Joseph Hogan","Yes, I think we've had good reception from a doctor's standpoint Steve. And the data we presented, the clinical evidence was as far as wide smart track, smart force, that you need aspects of our product line that allows us to happen, honestly we feel -- some of the doctors are aggressively pursuing this and it's ones who are really investing in this line in a big way, it's significant. Other ones are more cautious I think in a sense of how they start up and that is part of the tendency of this industry. The last thing I'd say is, it's going to be really important for us as part of our communications to patients is that the availability of this kind of opportunity, I think as patients ask for that as they movie with the GP treatment that you will see a more and more enthusiasm and uptake in that.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. I really appreciate the help.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Joe, I believe in your prepared remarks you talked about the design order backlog, and generally coming back to normal. Can you just expand upon that is there any imbalance in the backlog that still persists in the first quarter? Are you totally back to normal there?","Joseph Hogan","We're back to normal John.","John Kreger","Great, great. And then John the '17 outlook commentary that you gave which was very helpful; can you give us a sense about what the Smile Direct Club contribution would likely be based upon your expectations to either revenue or volumes?","John Morici","Yes, sure John. It's very minimal, we're definitely ramping up and growing with the Smile Direct Club but in our numbers it's very, very minimal.","John Kreger","Great, thanks. And just one last one, Joe, you mentioned that DSOs are becoming a much bigger part. Are you seeing that globally or really just in the U.S. and how do you think about that from a mix impact on your business either in terms of ASP or margins? Thanks.","Joseph Hogan","John, it's a good question. First of all, this is more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon, that's what to say that other heavy GP markets like the UK or whatever won't go through this dollar consolidation effect. Obviously there are some large DSOs out there from a deal standpoint, we obviously incentivize to drive volume but you know, right now we're not looking at any kind of -- I say material effect in the sense of ASP because you know balance is going other full patients in things that we offer. So as we go forward, we will be continuing to report as how we work with DSOs and how the things are going but did you prepare like a model John for 2017, I wouldn't think that you want to handicap it for DSO pricing.","John Kreger","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Ravi [ph] in for Rich. One question on the gross margin, it's a little bit [indiscernible] came in guidance for a little bit later than we had thought. Your base volume guidance is little bit higher, I'm just wondering if you could plan to put to take around that?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, I mean from a gross margin standpoint I mean we're going to continue to see some FX pressure. ASPs what we expect in the first quarter to be a little bit better than the first quarter due to some of the promotional activity that won't continue from Q4 into Q1. And you know, I think it's -- we haven't -- from a standpoint of planning our pricing for 2017, in the past we've taken is it's price increases in the past couple years we haven't planned that for 2017 yet so that might be something that is further down.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks. And then one on this -- forced in your revenue mix, the scanner business you have this new launch sort of hitting the little drive last year growing pretty impressively, you know it seems that we shouldn't be expecting that this year, in '17 should we still think of the scanner business is growing faster than clear aligner business? Sort of what commentary you can provide for another backlog?","Joseph Hogan","Yes, definitely we had a great backlog coming out of 2015 into 2016 for iTero and that contributed to the significant growth. The backlog is much more normalized growth for an equipment business now for iTero. So for 2017 we expect consistent [ph] growth to maybe a little bit better than Invisalign but certainly not nothing like we saw in 2016 because of the backlog.","Unidentified Analyst","That's it for me. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Ravi. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Block","Great, thanks and good afternoon guys. Joe, you gave '17 guidance and maybe now I can ask about 2018 and beyond. But -- you better top line for '17 but also higher spends, so it looks like you're getting to a similar operating income or you're absolute dollar is not far off from where we were but just a different formula getting there. And in around that 23% op margin, just taking a step back -- when you look out where the business is today or from an investment standpoint, where do we start to see that sort of elusive leverage? I mean you've got tremendous topline and it really is huge but you're still short of a good couple of hundred basis points below the low end of that 25 to 30 EBIT goal; so maybe can you speak to -- when you look out beyond '17, how you bring the leverage back to the business?","Joseph Hogan","When you say bring the leverage back [indiscernible] this happens to the point of the 25 or 30 that -- everyone here wants to get to and what you've got to look for. I'd say John, we're constantly faced here with are actually, really great short-term investments for us to expand this business significantly and an operating expense, it's almost immediately accretive within that year. And so you know what -- I think at some point in time as we become more and more penetrated or over utilization of these markets more spread internationally in a sense when we go internationally, you just don't hire sales people, you have to put infrastructure in place, you have legal firms, so a lot of things you have to put in place that puts this organization together. So I can't tell you that I don't want to start forecasting 2018, 2019 or whatever John but I hope what you see here is an incredibly profitable business that throws out a ton of cash year-in, year-out; we're in the 23%, we're in striking distance for the 25% range. If you want to cut back some of that investment and sacrifice some growth, we can be at 27% tomorrow. We just feel like it's the right thing for this business to keep investing in these. But I would say accretive types of investments, the payback was less than a year to 18 months and you're seeing in our results, you're seeing in the growth. But as we go forward, I'm very confident we're going to reach a 25% to 30% range, it's just -- we will continue to invest to grow and improve that utilization rate where it makes sense for the business.","Jonathan Block","Got it, very helpful and fair enough. I guess the second one, unless I miss the EMEA commentary, it seemed like it suggested that trends picked up throughout the quarter, so sort of 4Q orders were higher than shipments and arguably that sets up well for 1Q '17 shipments. I believe IGo was launched in the quarter in the UK and Germany, sort of during that fourth quarter. So any thoughts on -- you know the early traction or findings from IGo in EMEA. And when do you expect IGo to be released here in North America? Thanks.","Joseph Hogan","You know as far as IGo uptake, I mean we saw good uptake in the UK, we're working through Germany; Germany you see has a slower infusion rate than most countries in a sense of how we go about things. We're moving into Australia in that sense and working over to APAC and we will introduce it -- we're beginning to introduce it here in certain regions in the United States. So we'll keep you updated John, I mean we're excited about that product, we do need something for that GP segment, it's simple, it will allows GPs to assimilate this product quickly and see how it's integrates into your workflow. And so you will see us aggressively push that product around the globe in North America as we move in 2017.","Jonathan Block","Alright, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon. So Joe, let me follow-up I guess on John's margin questions and you might not have liked his question, you'll probably like mine even less I guess. But I'm just trying to understand -- you know, operating margin has been down a couple of hundred basis points this quarter. It seems like you're guiding down 250 basis points or so next quarter, and yet guiding flat for the year and I really respect a lot of the investments you're making; I think they're the right calls for the business in 2017 and beyond. So just trying to understand if the last couple quarters or at least 4Q and 1Q are down; how do we get flat for all of '17 in the face of some of these investments that you are making?","Joseph Hogan","Jeff, I think -- you know, I've been here long enough to be through a few of these first quarters now, I think you know that our first quarter a lot of something that presses up working margin in expenses, that's is a reason how we account for things, we lay in investments for the rest of the year so it's always our most pressured quarter from an operating profit standpoint. So I mean look at that comparison from 4Q to 1Q, that's always a tough comparison in sense of how we're offering. I'll step back, you know, Jeff, I don't mind John's question, in fact I think it's a question that we've always asked ourself here so I never wanted you guys to misinterpret that we will get unsettled for a question like that. I think it's legitimate in something we wrestle [ph] this year.","You know as we forecast for next year, you're right, we're keeping our projections for operating profit or you know, it's pretty much flat with what we thought this year. This year it's pretty phenomenal and sensible what we're forecasting. We think that's the right focus for this business right now. You know, look, I'd just say it from respect to the standpoint if I came in closer, we're going to be 18% operating profit for all of the next year because we're doing something -- I'd say that and we'll probably be out of the room or what we will speak of this team but we want to be as close to the edge as we possibly can in making sure we produce good margin and cash for this business and take advantage of all the opportunities we've had and that the balance we hope that we're communicating for you and now we're executing.","Jeff Johnson","That's helpful. And last question I guess or two, one for John, just -- can you remind me John, does the peso of weakness that we've seen so much in accelerate here recently, does that help at all from a margin perspective? I think the answer is yes, but just if you could remind me there. And then on ASPs, I know the question's been asked a couple times Joe but just want to circle back there; they have been declining here over the last couple of years and I know the promotional activity and some of the utilization rates, people are hitting their targets, things like that so that's all good but I think you said DSO is flat on the year and that would definitely be a change in the trend line from the last couple years so just want to confirm maybe what's driving the flattening out of those ASPs after a couple years of having come down a bit.","Joseph Hogan","Just to answer your question on peso, yes, the dollar strengthening against the peso is favorable for us as of the cost there.","John Morici","On your DSO question, I'd say don't misinterpret my answer on the DSO. You know, the DSOs, they have some pretty good targets in a sense that they could grow; they will get a commensurate kind of discount from Invisalign standpoint. What I'm saying is in the whole mix of products that we have in North America, don't overweight that thing falling down the overall total. But you will see the DSOs can grow aggressively, they will be rewarded for it and so we'll continue to grow that.","From an ASP standpoint, I think you have to remember we've got price last year too and that helps us. FX didn't help us in the fourth quarter and that way also so we're playing in a bandwidth here, you know, price increases, FX of $20 or so and I have no idea\u2026","Shirley Stacy","International mix.","John Morici","Yes, international mix. So I think David continue to guide ASPs that we're pretty much constant from year to year. We still think about that but there is a lot of noises when we think about that from oceans that we do and mix like Shirley mentioned. But we're counting on it pretty level as we go into 2017.","Jeff Johnson","Fair enough, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks, good afternoon everyone, congrats on the results. So just for us, I guess a couple of quick questions here, just on the litigation news that was in the other press release today. Just first on that patent loss in news in the UK, we don't have as much background than UK market dynamics; so I guess I'm just wondering you are able to provide any current approximate market share splits maybe for you and other such as clear correct in that market? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Joseph Hogan","As far as I can't give you any answer but it's not material in the sense of market share in the UK. You know, there entity over in UK, I want the o be certain when those bounce like direct but it's not, it's something to do with this, and is still pretty much [indiscernible] here, just trying to continue with the model that they have in that and hook up with someone in the UK that really wants to try to implement it in the model. And so you know obviously our lawsuit is not exactly what we do but it's extended as we mentioned to the international market and we'll continue to be aggressive in defending our IP.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, and then as far as the implications in refilling the action in the federal court in Houston, again without having the full historical background at my fingertips; is this still related more to the patents that are set to expire this year in the U.S. or is it more geared towards U.S. patents that go well beyond this year?","Joseph Hogan","We've got a special guest today.","Unidentified Company Representative","Good afternoon everybody. The patents that are before the court in the clear correct action are a combination of patents that will expire in the next couple of years and also patents with a longer life span.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, but as far as\u2026","Joseph Hogan","[Indiscernible].","Unidentified Company Representative","Sure. I mean once the patent expires, it just means that the art disclosed in the patents can be freely practiced by anybody in the market. It doesn't make up for infringement during the life of the patent for which anybody would be responsible for damages.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, got it. Okay, maybe I'll just follow-up offline with some additional questions on that. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","We can set up a call with Roger.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Matt O'Brien","Thanks. So I've got one here. EMEA growth continues to be very strong, how much of that growth is attributed to the expansion into non-core markets?","Joseph Hogan","You mean non-core market to be other countries? What do you think it is?","Matt O'Brien","Yes, correct.","Joseph Hogan","I'd say it's minimal at first. I mean, we look at India, we're moving in from different places, so I wouldn't look at that as material but I might look at Nordic countries in Europe that we've done that three or four years ago, that's starts to become important. So again, as we talk about moving into new markets just think we have -- we laid out a lot of infrastructure, spend money to put sales people in place and then you start to see almost geometric growth in those areas but that's not what I would say to drive in anyway. Right now the kind of forecast we're getting in for 2017 or what we saw in 2016.","Matt O'Brien","Okay. And then also you guys point out low volume docs in Q3; how did those guys perform in the quarter?","Joseph Hogan","They were good. And we had -- we had -- because we had the issue obviously in the third quarter, they came back pretty strong. You saw the GP in United States from 3.1 to 3.2 utilization standpoint, that might sound small but that's pretty big when you look at it across more than 150,000.","Matt O'Brien","Okay, great. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Operator, we'll take one more question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Matthews of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Two things; one Joe, you mentioned in the script something about being improved evidence of clinical efficacy and I'm wondering where that came from and what impact that's having because you know back in the day the pushback from Orthos was all about a lack of clinical proof here and so that sounds like a trend in the right direction.","Joseph Hogan","I first say you know not to be smartass during the things but we spent in a course of 20 years a $1 billion in trying to learn and accomplish significant predictable orthodontic movements and increasingly as you've seen our G-series, you know, from G3 all the up to G7, we just announced; we just improved that capability year in and year out. So I think depending on when you take, when you go back in history, many of the people in Nordic [ph] community, they have gone way up and they wanted their competence. And what's really critical or in general how you finish and they have confidence that they can really finish and what more we hear is that they have as much confidence in how this line can finish but they do it large. So I hope I'm answering your question?","Unidentified Analyst","No, that's right. No, I appreciate it. And don't worry, you're not being a smartass, I appreciate that. Second thing, you were early on Joe in this production shift, moving closer to end market even before the election result made it sort of a headline issue; but given all of the comments that you made about how much you've invested in [indiscernible] and high tech it is; what are you learning about the shifting to other countries now that you're actually in the process of doing it in Asia and Europe; what have you learned? What's the price, if any?","Joseph Hogan","You know, honestly Jeff, I've done this is in other businesses I've been in the moving products and facilities in some locations to others and I'd say over learning here is what I've seen in other areas. One is, you never been just transfer production unit to unit, it's going to be different and have to reflect culture and where you're moving to. So if you look at APAC, we'll probably look at different types of automation in different aspects of that plan because as you know there is a difference than what you have from a labor standpoint in Mexico to do that. I think we're learning that our infrastructure is really a challenge in the sense of the IT piece and I have to have much more flexibility to be able to handle these things and when you get away from a unitary spot and you move to a broader area. But you also understand from our customers, you see the excitement from our customers knowing that things like ClinCheck, or to get closer to with China because we have many interactions for Mandarin, you know, the fact that English that goes between Costa Rica and China and different part of APAC; great excitement from our customer base to really improve that efficiency and to have more of a regional -- kind of a cultural aspect to the business. So those three things aren't a surprise to me but what I really love is how much customers embraced it. And we have flexibility in the sense of how we manufacture products and how we do things in that whole value chain that we talked about between OA and clinical IT and also the fact for using -- disassemble and reassemble those change around these areas to make it better for our customer base and that's a great thing about them.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks so much.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Jeff. Well, thank you everyone. This concludes our conference call. We appreciate you taking the time today. Look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences including Leerink and ROTH, as well as the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show at the end of February.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?","Joseph Hogan","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the fourth quarter and the full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the first quarter and share our thoughts for 2019. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year. Q4 revenues were better than expected, reflecting higher Invisalign ASPs and volume growth of 31% year-over-year. As well as another record quarter for iTero scanners with revenue up 55% year-over-year.","Q4 sequential growth was driven by a strong quarter for EMEA with record growth for teens as well as continued traction with Invisalign Lite and iGo. Q4 operating margin of 22.6% reflects higher doctor training and manufacturing costs as well as higher legal fees than anticipated, partially offset by sequential improvement in Invisalign ASPs.","For the quarter, we trained a record 5,270 new doctors in Q4, which includes about 3,000 international doctors, of which, half were in EMEA and half were in APAC.","For the year, we achieved record revenues of nearly $2 billion and had over 1.2 million people start treatment with Invisalign clear aligners for the first time, resulting in our 6 millionth Invisalign patient, a teenager from China. These results reflect record revenues and volumes for both Invisalign and iTero.","Across customer channels and country markets and continued strength from teens, which grew 40%. The total number of teenagers treated with Invisalign this year was over 333,000, representing 27% of our volume.","Finally, in 2018, we trained a record number of new Invisalign doctors, nearly 20,000 worldwide. And for the first time, more than half of them were international doctors.","Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results starting with the Americas region.","For the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume increased 21.7% year-over-year and was down sequentially off a record Q3 volumes, which benefited from strong uptake of promotions last quarter, predominantly by high-volume Invisalign doctors. On a sequential basis, Q4 reflects growth from the Americas GPs, offset by America's orthos, particularly high-volume doctors.","Year-over-year growth for Q4 reflects continued adoption of Invisalign treatment from both orthodontist and GP channels, which were up 24.7% and 17.3%, respectively. We also saw good growth from our DSO partners across both GPs and orthos, up nearly 50% year-over-year.","For the full year, Invisalign volume for the Americas region was up 24.2% compared to 2017. Americas orthos were up 27.2% and Americas GP dentists were up 19.8%, the second highest annual growth rate for orthos and the highest annual growth rate for GPs in 6 years.","For Q4, we trained a record 2,290 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which, 1,725 were North American doctors and 565 were Latin American doctors. In total, we trained 7,885 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas in 2018, an increase of 19%.","For international business, Q4 was a great quarter with Invisalign case volume up 12.2% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the EMEA region, offset somewhat by seasonality in the Asia Pacific region.","On a year-over-year basis, strong Invisalign volume growth of 45.3% reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region. In Q4, we trained nearly 3,000 new Invisalign doctors internationally with roughly 50% in EMEA and 50% in APAC.","In EMEA, Q4 was a strong quarter, up 42.7% year-over-year, driven by record Invisalign volumes in all country markets as well as strong growth in the teen segment, which is up 75.1% from the prior year, reflecting continued success of our Teen 360 program.","For the full year, EMEA was up 38.6% led by Iberia, France and the U.K. as well as our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe. During 2018, we went direct in Turkey, Israel and Russia, adding to our expansion country markets.","For APAC, Q4 was down sequentially as expected due to seasonality -- seasonally slower period in the region, up 49.3% year-over-year with record Invisalign volume in almost every country market led by China, Japan, ANZ. Q4 results reflect continued strong growth from teenage patients as well as adults, with GP dentists up 77.1% year-over-year.","During Q4, we trained 1,530 new doctors in APAC, of which half were in China. We held several clinical education events across APAC designed to help increase doctor's confidence in adoption of Invisalign treatment, including how critical the iTero scanner is to practice growth.","For the year, Invisalign volume from the international doctors increased 45% led by growth from China and our core EMEA country markets. In total, international volumes represented 41% of worldwide Invisalign case shipments.","Despite our record results, we're still very clearly underpenetrated in APAC overall and specifically in China. As the second largest market for Align, China represents enormous growth potential, and our ability to expand and drive penetration across the region relies on our ability to be closer to doctors and their patients, communicate in local language and as much as possible, operate like a local company.","Late in Q4, we began fabricating Invisalign aligners in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China, our first aligner fabrication facility outside of Juarez, Mexico. There's a temporary facility that will be replaced by our own building in 2020. Over the next year, we will continue to build our manufacturing abilities in Ziyang and ramp up production to serve the rapidly growing Chinese market.","However, it would take a couple of quarters to fully transition aligner production from Juarez to Ziyang, and we would expect manufacturing overhead in Ziyang to be underutilized during this period.","Product and technology innovation continues to be a key growth driver across our regions. Over the past year, we launched several new Invisalign offerings for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive treatment to give doctors more tools and choices to treat a greater range of cases, from adults to teenagers and now even kids as young as 7 years old.","In mid-2018, we launched a new Invisalign Go product with a more user-friendly iTero digital chair-side experience and greater flexibility to treat a wider range of mild to moderate cases such as crowded or gapped teeth that require teeth straightening prior to restorative treatments.","We also began offering Invisalign First, designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion.","We're pleased with the initial uptake and customer feedback. In 2018, we shipped nearly 5,000 Invisalign First cases to over 1,300 doctors, primarily in North America, EMEA, Australia and New Zealand, and Japan.","And in October, we received FDA approval for Invisalign with mandibular advancement feature in the U.S., which is the only clear aligner product approved to simultaneously move teeth and the mandible in young patients. In Q4, we began shipping mandibular advancement in the U.S.","Late in the quarter, we are seeing initial uptake along with continued ramp globally. To date, over 17,000 teenagers have used Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement, led by China, Canada, France and Spain.","Overall for the teen market, in Q4, over 87,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 37.3% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, driven by both the Americas and EMEA regions.","For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North America orthos increased 23.7% and international doctors were up 63.7%. For the full year, total teen cases worldwide grew 40.3% to a total of 333,000 teenagers, or 27.1% of our total volume.","Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. We invest over $100 million each year in consumer marketing and programs, including TV, digital, social media, PR, event marketing and more recently, our patient concierge and Invisalign Experience program. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.","In Q4, we continue to see strong digital engagement with consumers and had nearly 4 million unique visitors on invisalign.com sites for a total of 17 million over the year. Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our fourth quarter slides.","The impact of the digital technology on our world and specifically in our industry is challenging our customers to evolve just about every aspect of their practice, especially how they engage with consumers and turn them into patients. What worked for doctors in the past from a marketing, conversion or workflow perspective will not work today.","Consumers expect more and are demanding different types of digital-driven expenses. Many doctors don't know where and how to start. The work we are doing with our integrated consumer marketing platform, patient concierge service, and Invisalign Experience program has given us better insights and information that we're sharing with doctors to help them reshape their practices.","For example, the Invisalign Experience program is designed to reach consumers in a retail environment where they shop, play and dine and educate them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment and value of getting a better smile and connect them with an Invisalign doctor.","One of the ways we do this is through the Invisalign store, which is owned and operated by Align. Invisalign stores bring the brand directly to consumers in a contemporary, interactive digital environment. Consumers can browse, ask questions, learn about Invisalign treatment and technology, and the benefits of straightening their teeth.","Visitors are offered a complimentary iTero intraoral 3D scan and a visual simulation of what their smile might look like after Invisalign treatment. Interested consumers are connected with a local Invisalign doctor's office of their choice to discuss potential treatment options.","By the end of 2018, we finished with 12 locations in the United States, and these stores are helping us learn more than ever about reducing barriers to treatment for potential patients so that they are excited about getting a better smile with an Invisalign doctor.","In addition to providing potential leads to participating Invisalign practices, we're also seeing a positive halo effect and increased growth rates for all of the Invisalign practices in the surrounding area, whether they participate in the store network or not.","Over the past year, more than 55,000 consumers visited Invisalign store and nearly 10,000 received a complementary scan. While we are still early in the development of our Invisalign stores and the overarching Invisalign Experience program, we're excited about its potential and the positive impact we can have on demand creation for Invisalign practices by engaging directly with consumers.","The Invisalign Experience program is just getting started and continues to evolve. In October, we announced that we're partnering with a few Invisalign doctors in selected U.S. cities to pilot new ways to reach consumers and connect them directly with doctors to start Invisalign treatment.","These Invisalign Experience locations are owned and operated by doctors under a special license from Align and are intended to help doctors integrate consumer friendly design and consultation workflow into their practices and test new Invisalign Experience branding and explore a consumer focused approach to consultations and Invisalign treatments starts in a variety of settings, including in-office, retail and mobile. We'll continue to share our learnings as we get more of these pilots up and running.","Finally, I want to spend a few minutes talking about digital technology and the transformation in our industry from an old analog process to an end-to-end digital workflow. Align is helping doctors on their digital journey, which starts with an iTero scanner and ends with stronger practices and better smiles for their patients.","As a leader in digital orthodontics, we are best positioned to help Invisalign-trained doctors find more efficient ways to drive digitalization in their practices and support those practices and to help them improve their productivity over time.","To that end, last year, we launched project [PNO] we now call -- we have renamed it ADAPT, Align digital and practice transformation, with several small orthodontic clinics across EMEA, APAC and North America with the objective to demonstrate that a fully digital practice can be productive, efficient and profitable.","Process involves detailed analysis of the current practice data and workflows performed by experts and continuous improvement in workflow. While it's still early, the initial results from the ADAPT study are incredibly promising. Based upon the study on practice development, we've come to the conclusion that the benefit fully from technology and to own the digital transformation of their practices, doctors need to organize their workflows and premises so that approximately 80% of their organization is built around this digital transformation with clear aligners.","This means that doctors who commit to digital transformation had the potential to do more, see more patients and expand their practice or take more time off. Whatever their goals, with Invisalign plus iTero together, we can help them see the benefits they want from a fully end-to-end digital workflow.","For iTero scanner and services business, Q4 was a very strong quarter with better-than-expected revenues, which were up 13% sequentially and 54.8% year-over-year, driven by strength in all regions and customer channels. Record Q4 volumes reflect continued commercialization of the iTero 2 Element and Element Flex scanners, especially for restorative GP dentists in North America, the continued rollout of our major DSO partners and increased sales internationally, including Italy, Japan and China, where we began manufacturing the iTero Element this past year.","For 2018, we had an outstanding year for iTero scanners with volumes up 77.2% year-over-year. Cumulatively, over 11.5 million orthodontic scans and 3.2 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.","For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with digital scanner in the Americas increased 72.6% from 65.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased 57.5%, up 41.4% in the same quarter last year. What's really exciting to see is that within the Americas, 88.7% of cases submitted by North American orthos were submitted digitally.","In China, it went from 0 to 45.9% in 1 year. This means that within 1 year or 2, nearly all Invisalign cases will be submitted digitally, primarily through an iTero scanner. We're very excited about the continued progress we've made with iTero business overall, and remain confident that will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase adoption of Invisalign treatment.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Morici","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $534 million, up 5.7% from the prior quarter and up 26.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago.","For the full year, revenue of about $2 billion was up 33.5% year-over-year, reflecting a record 1.2 million Invisalign shipments and 31.9% year-over-year growth, with strength across all regions and customer channels as well as record iTero scanners volume, which was up 77.2%.","For clear aligners, Q4 revenue of $445.6 million was up 4.3% sequentially on higher-than-expected Invisalign ASPs and strong Invisalign volume from EMEA. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 22.4% reflected strong Invisalign shipment across all customer channels and geographies.","Q4 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $5 to $1,235, reflecting price increases and lower discounts, partially offset by higher growth on non-comprehensive cases and includes a $10 of unfavorable foreign exchange.","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down approximately $70, reflecting promotional discounts, higher growth on non-comprehensive cases and includes $25 of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by price increases.","Total Q4 Invisalign shipments of 333,800 cases were up 4.5% sequentially and up 30.9% year-over-year.","For Americas orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was slightly lower than our Q4 outlook, primarily due to longer cycle times in Latin America, and was down 2.9% sequentially and up 24.7% year-over-year.","For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 3.2% sequentially and up 17.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 12.2% sequentially and up 45.3% year-over-year.","Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $88.4 million, up 13% sequentially due to volume increases in Americas and EMEA. Year-over-year revenue was up 54.8%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions.","Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 71.7%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 3.8 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.1%, down 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to higher number of aligners per case, higher freight cost, reflecting faster international growth, higher training cost due to more doctors trained in the quarter and manufacturing spend driven by operational expansion in China, which was partially offset by slightly higher Invisalign ASPs.","Clear aligner gross margin was down 3.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher number of cases per -- aligners per case, lower ASPs, higher training costs and freight charges and regional expansion of our manufacturing-related activities in China and EMEA.","Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 59.9%, down 4 points sequentially and down 2.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to manufacturing and freight costs and lower ASP.","Q4 operating expenses were $262.6 million, up sequentially 6.5% and up 26.1% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses primarily reflects our continued investment in sales and R&D activities along with higher legal, consulting expenses, partially offset by seasonally lower advertising spending. Year-over-year, the increase in operating expenses reflects higher spending commensurate with growth.","Our fourth quarter operating income was $120.5 million, down 3.8% sequentially and up 9.9% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income is primarily attributed to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses as mentioned earlier.","On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating income primarily reflects higher revenue offset by higher sales and marketing, R&D, legal\/consulting spending and unfavorable foreign exchange.","Our fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, down 2.2 points sequentially and down 3.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin, as mentioned earlier. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin as described earlier and about 0.5 points impact from unfavorable foreign exchange.","With regards to fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was [8.5%] [18.5%], which includes approximately $1.9 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.","Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.20, down $0.04 sequentially and up $1.07 compared to the prior year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the fourth quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $744.5 million, an increase of approximately $131.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations.","Of our $744.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $432.5 million was held in the U.S. and $312 million was held by our international entities.","Q4 accounts receivable balance was $439 million, up approximately 4.5% sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 74 days, down 1 day sequentially and up 5 days as of Q4 last year.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $241.3 million, up $79 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $187 million.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities.","During Q4, we repurchased $50 million of stock against our stock buyback authorizations and have $500 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program.","Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2018 results. In 2018, we shipped a record 1.2 million Invisalign cases, up 31.9%. This reflects 45% volume growth for our international doctors and 24.2% volume growth from our Americas doctors. Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 77.2% versus 2017.","Total revenue was a record $2 billion, up 33.5% year-over-year with Invisalign revenues of $1.7 billion.","Full year operating income of $466.7 million, up 31.9% versus 2017 and operating margin at 23.7%. Free cash flow was $331.4 million.","For the year, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Align stock for $300 million. 2018 diluted earnings per share was $4.92.","With that, let's turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For international, we expect Q1 to be up sequentially as the EMEA market maintains momentum from Q4 and APAC is seasonally flat sequentially as some markets observe the Lunar New Year holiday.","For Americas, we expect Q1 to also increase sequentially with strong growth from North America orthos and a slight increase in North America GPs. We expect Latin America to be down sequentially given this is their summer holiday season.","We expect our iTero business to be down slightly from a record Q4, consistent with seasonal trends and capital equipment market. And we continue to expect minimal volume for SmileDirectClub.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign's case volume is expected to be in a range of 340,000 to 345,000 cases, up approximately 25% to 27% year-over-year.","We expect Q1 revenues to be in the range of $525 million to $535 million, reflecting increased volume and flat ASPs versus Q4 2018. We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 70.3% to 71%, reflecting our higher start-up costs in China and increased doctor training expenses.","We expect Q1 operating expenses to meet a range of $290 million to $294 million, which reflects our sales force expansion and increased legal expenses. Q1 operating margin should be in a range of 15.1% to 16.1%.","Our effective tax rate should be approximately 16%, which is higher than 2018 due to nondeductible officer stock compensation based on recent IRS guidance and our lower stock price. We expect approximately $3 million to $4 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub's net losses. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $80.9 million, exclusive of any share repurchases.","Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.78 to $0.84. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q1 to be approximately $60 million to $65 million. And we expect depreciation and amortization to be $19 million to $20 million.","Now let me turn to our view for the full year 2019, notwithstanding the impact of foreign exchange rates. We expect total revenue growth for the company, Invisalign and iTero, to be in the middle range of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%. We anticipate Invisalign ASPs to be flat from Q4 2018, reflecting continued growth from international regions, increased share of the teen segment and uptake of non-comprehensive products.","We anticipate Invisalign volume to be in the middle of the range of our long-term model target of 20% to 30%. We anticipate gross margin and operating margin to improve over the course of the year. We anticipate gross margin to approach our long-term model target of 73% to 78% by Q4.","We will continue to fuel growth globally and expect to invest in international and operational expansion as well as sales and marketing initiatives, including nearly 100 new sales reps in Americas hired at the end of Q4 and additional GP sales reps in EMEA beginning in Q1. These investments also include continued litigation expenses to protect our intellectual property and extend our competitive advantage.","Given our continued growth and expansion internationally, during the year, we intend to reorganize our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. The proposed corporate structure may also allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies after they are implemented.","As a result, we will incur expenses in the near-term and expect to realize the related benefits in subsequent years. We expect our operating margin for the second half to be in a long-term model of 25% to 30%.","For the full year, we anticipate operating margin to be below our long-term target as it includes approximately 1.5 to 2 points impact from increased legal fees and the planned corporate structure reorganization. We expect equity loss for our investment in SmileDirectClub to be $3 million to $4 million per quarter.","We expect our tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24%, which includes about $8 million of excess tax benefits. 2019 tax rate is higher than 2018 primarily due to a release of unrecognized tax benefits that will not repeat.","We expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating results to account for somewhere in the range of 50% to 55% of our full year results. We expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph Hogan","Thanks, John, and thanks to those who joined our call today. Overall, 2018 was a great year for Align, and I'm very pleased with the strong performance for Invisalign and iTero across all key regions, customers channels and products. This year, not only do we celebrate our 21st year in business, we also achieved several major milestones, including our 6 millionth Invisalign patient and $2 billion in revenue for the first time. It took nearly 20 years to reach our first $1 billion in sales and only 2 years to reach our second billion dollars.","We also delivered in our strategic growth drivers with new product and technology innovation, expansion of our manufacturing and treatment planning operations, and raising awareness of Invisalign treatment with consumers and engaging with them in more innovative ways than ever before.","As I step back and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, I want to reinforce the importance of the investments we're making to drive growth globally. The underlying opportunity for doctors and their patients is expanding based on digital technology that Align has spent over 21 years developing.","And while we have a huge amount of accumulated expertise and knowledge in digital technology and orthodontics, we have to ensure that we have the capabilities to further expand and regionalize our operations, extend our competitive lead and protect our business from companies willing to take shortcuts with respect to intellectual property. It is incumbent upon us to drive the transition to a fully digital workflow and continue to deliver new products and services that not only benefit Invisalign doctors but their patients and consumers alike.","Following our Ortho Summit in November, I met with hundreds of Invisalign doctors and their staff, I had the opportunity to travel to our regional kickoff meetings and connect with Align team members at every level of our organization to hear their detailed plans of their upcoming year. While I spent more of my time at the Americas kickoff because of my interim role as the Americas leader, I can say unequivocally that across the company, the excitement and level of engagement surrounding our business and market opportunity was palpable.","Overall, the demand profile globally is solid and nothing we see in the environment suggest otherwise. We're running the place we know and are confident we can bring greater efficiencies, economies of scale and know that adding sales, training to get closer to customers in local markets creates sustainable competitive advantage.","Finally, as most of you know, one of the key orthodontic journals in North America is the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, and they often flip through it and ask why there aren't more clear aligners profiled. This week, I was caught off guard when I opened the December issue and found it dedicated entirely to clear aligner therapy.","Bob Keim is the editor of the JCO and has been to many of our Invisalign Summits. In meetings with him and reading his editorials, I knew he supported Invisalign treatment and clear aligners in general, but it was never clear to me today extent he believed in clear aligner technology as we've seen in the most recent issue of the JCO, especially the editor's column, \"The End of Braces?\" If you haven't had a chance to read the JCO, you should. Bob could not take a stronger position for clear aligners. He acknowledges that he may take some flak for being so bold, but I believe his strong endorsement is a major breakthrough for Align and digital orthodontics.","With that, I want to thank you, again for joining our call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. We'll see many of you in Chicago Midwinter Meeting next month as well as industry and financial conferences throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, just to start on ASPs. Joe, could you maybe talk through the progression of ASPs that you saw over the quarter? On a worldwide basis, certainly seems like you guys were able to stabilize ASPs in 4Q relative to 3Q and looking at the implied guidance from 1Q, seems like that's expected to continue, and in the full year, you're calling for that to be at the kind of level we should look for. So I guess, just how did they progress throughout 4Q? And then just related to that, what are the major pushes and pulls as you think about ASPs over the course of '19?","Joseph Hogan","Bob, that's a big question, but I'll make it simple, okay? We had an issue in the third quarter in the Americas with our Advantage Program that I think kicked off this ASP concern. As we said, we retracted that $300 that we offered on teens and also adults at that point in time.","After that, basically, out ASPs are what they normally are, in the sense of mixes and matches across the spectrum of EMEA in different places. So I mean, that's the total -- you want to talk about we have an exchange hit this quarter also but again, I think we prepared you for that in the last quarter. So overall, the only change is we didn't have an advantage issue in the third quarter as in the fourth quarter.","Robert Jones","Yes. I guess just to follow on, on that, Joe. I mean, I think the question really is as you think about '19, obviously, those programs go away. I guess, the expectation looks like here in the slides that you're still thinking that it's going to be flat to the 4Q levels.","So just trying to understand a little bit better what could move the ASPs up over the course of the year as we think about some of the things that hopefully, would not reoccur in '19 what happened in '18.","Joseph Hogan","Yes, John will jump in on this.","John Morici","Bob, this is John. So the couple of positive mix that we talk a lot about, the international growth, we continue to see strong growth internationally. Mandibular advancement in the U.S. contributes overall to our team growth, which are comprehensive cases and those help. And we are also seeing growth on the comprehensive side. So we think those three, we've seen some balance and that's what we would expect for 2019.","Robert Jones","Great. And then I guess just as a follow-up from me, John, while I have you. If you think about the margin outlook for the year, it looks like you guys are calling for the growth in operating margins to get into the long-term ranges in the back half. Just at a high level, I guess, how much visibility and control do you guys have over that trajectory into the back half of '19 around the margins?","John Morici","Yes, Bob. It really starts with some of the manufacturing efficiencies that we expect to get as we start to ramp up in China and continue to ramp up with our treatment planning. We'll see that continue to ramp as we move through the year. We have other products and programs that will also help us from a mix standpoint as well. So we feel really good about how we're -- how we view the year and the expectation of margin improvement throughout the year.","Robert Jones","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit more about the reorganization expenses. Are you sort of thinking of those on an ongoing basis or more onetime? I guess, my question stems in part because I was wondering if you were thinking about perhaps potentially backing those out of your 2019 results?","John Morici","Elizabeth, this is John. This is a onetime. I mean, it's -- as the company expands and grows internationally, it's looking at some of the efficiencies that we can gain through that change. And we report numbers on a GAAP basis. We'll continue to do so, but we'll give you highlights as the year goes on as update.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, also could you just talk a little bit more about the sales investments that you guys are making into the Americas in terms of any particular details you could provide on that? That will be helpful.","Joseph Hogan","Yes, Elizabeth. It's Joe. Look, in Americas, we're still really underpenetrated in the marketplace, particularly on the GP segment, and so we decided we'd add 100 salespeople. We feel really good about that investment giving us good short-term returns. We've done this before almost in every cycle since I've been here. It's a play we know how to run, and we know the importance of it overall.","So don't look at it as an anomaly. It's just a continuation of building out our sales force and taking advantages of some of the man out there. Elizabeth, I'll also tell you. It's a high touch thing. You have to touch doctors in this business to drive sales. It's really -- and it -- this doesn't happen on itself.","It's -- there's a constant touch to it. So we're really aware of that. Often, our treatment is much different than what these doctors have done before. Our salespeople, we train them well clinically but also from a business standpoint so that they can talk about clinically how to use a product line but also from a business standpoint how you integrate it into the practice. So adding salespeople is really important.","Elizabeth Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Please proceed.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I think the paranoia is going to sort of move from ASPs to volumes and margins tomorrow. So maybe on the margin side, John, for '19, you mentioned expectations to be below your long-term op margin goal of 25% to 30%. Specifically, you called out 150 to 200 bps from increased legal fees in the reorg.","So a couple of questions there. Is that reorg all specific to '19? And then if we were to normalize for the 150 to 200 bps, would your '19 op margin approach the lower band of your long-term 25% to 30% goal? And then I got a quicker follow-up.","John Morici","Yes, that's the right way to look at it, Jon. So this is 2019 expenses. And these expenses, we think we would have been in the long-term range that we have of 25% to 30% if we didn't have these expenses.","Jonathan Block","Okay. One question, short answer. I'll take it. And then maybe, Joe, for you, on the vols. Just any more color. I mean, any thoughts on the North American ortho weakness? I do have a hard time believing that all the weakness was Latin America just looking at the size of that business.","But anything more North American ortho weakness? Is this a pause before mandibular and Invisalign First greater hold in 2019? And maybe, if you don't mind, any thoughts on what MAF and First could contribute to North America this year? Thanks, guys.","Joseph Hogan","Yes, Jon, look, I - the America's growth this year, I know we had the blip in the third quarter overall, but 2018 is a good year for us. If you look at the last 6 years, this is actually the second highest growth profile we've had. America's growth is about 17% on an average over those 6 years.","The orthos grew -- this is the only -- this is the second -- from a percentage standpoint, best year we've had from an ortho standpoint. What happened between the third and fourth quarter, again, we think it was a -- that I mentioned on my opening, was the uptake that we have at that Advantage Program in the third quarter. And that was repeated in the fourth quarter, and we think we have this quarter-over-quarter kind of discrepancy.","GP is at an all-time high from a growth standpoint overall. And then obviously, from a Brazil standpoint, too, it's starting to become material in the sense of the size of that business, and we're looking for good contributions this year. So Jon, I hope I'm answering your question.","But I'd say then if you look at the volume overall, you see how strong EMEA has been. The expansion of EMEA, in the areas like Turkey and Russia and in the Middle East, has been important to us. But also France is growing well. Spain has been strong. Italy came back. We saw it. We've had great success with Go in -- with the GPs out of the U.K. but also in Germany, too.","So we really feel great about that region. And then APAC, again, we see strength. We've seen strength in China. We see strength in APAC overall. Japan's growth has been phenomenal. And then bleed that in with our iTero growth, too, that you see across the spectrum. Overall, we feel good about volume.","Jonathan Block","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for your time guys,","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of housekeeping items, John, in terms of the fourth quarter. Could you quantify the impact in Latin America from the longer cycle times? And you expect that to normalize in the first quarter? And then in terms of the fourth quarter OpEx, it looks like it was about $12 million above your guidance, which is very atypical and unusual. Can you point us to the areas of spend that -- or perhaps accelerated or brought you in above your plan?","John Morici","Yes. So for the fourth quarter in Latin America, I mean, it's a growing business, as Joe said, and it's a couple of thousand cases that were kind of in transition on a -- from -- right at the end of the fourth quarter. And then as far as spend, were you specifically talking about spend in fourth quarter or compared to the guide in the first quarter?","Brandon Couillard","Yes, the fourth quarter OpEx relative to your guidance.","John Morici","Yes. We saw added litigation expenses as we've been going -- as a part of our process that we have on the legal side. There's some added costs that we're showing there. And as Joe said, we added some salespeople, and some of that, those hires and those expenses came into fourth quarter. But we wanted people on the ground and ready to be able to sell and give us volume as soon as possible into 2019. So some of those costs hit there as well.","Brandon Couillard","And coming back to ASPs for 2019. It would seem to imply that worldwide ASPs for the year would be down about 3% year-over-year. I understand currency is probably half of that. Mix is another dynamic. But would it be your expectation that promotional activity would be sort of consistent year-over-year? Or is there some cushion built-in perhaps for more, I guess, promo activity in '19 relative to last year?","John Morici","I would say there's nothing that specifically that we're looking at additional promotions or others. We look at the business as various products and new products that come out, changes that we make. We look at promotions to better drive volume and drive uptake across the regions.","So they vary by region, but nothing out of the ordinary. And we were pleased to see where ASPs finished and have a good expectation of -- given the positive growth internationally, the positive growth that we see on teens, and we're seeing strong non-comprehensive growth. All that taking into account keeps us flat for ASPs.","Brandon Couillard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon, Thanks for time here. I wanted to focus on how you thought about incorporating any potential contribution from the sales force additions in the outlook for 2019. If I think back to -- in past years where there had been substantial adds to the sales force, something like 6 months after those [pit] hit the Street, we saw a benefit.","So in 2019, are you modeling in any benefit from these rep adds that you may have already? If so, can you give us a sense for how big those might be? And I'm just curious. As we think about the outlook for the year, let's call it 25% on volumes, 25%, 27% in the first quarter, it just doesn't look like there's any anticipation of acceleration or benefit from those hires.","John Morici","Yes, Steve. This is John. Yes, 6 months to 9 months is kind of the range you would expect to really start seeing those salespeople that you add once they're fully trained and have their territories and kind of hit. So we should see an acceleration in the second half given the adds that we have. And as we see, we factored in into our guide as much as we can see now based on those adds.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then I would agree with the comment that was made earlier about where the paranoia is going to shift. And so I just wanted, given in part in response to the many e-mails I've gotten here in the last 45 minutes or so, give you a chance to just comment on your thinking on competition. Is there any sign of competition being relevant in the field that you can pick out at this point or still the view that it's just not material, not something that people ought to be thinking about?","Joseph Hogan","Steve, it's Joe. We -- obviously, we're seeing Ormco down in ANSI, and I think we saw recent announcement that they are going to kind of pace themselves as they go through 2019. I think you're seeing the same thing out of 3M, too. So honestly, we know you guys do surveys, and we read your surveys. We do our own or whatever.","We know some of the docs out there trying these product lines. And we have access to some of the software that's going on out there and the product lines that they're representing or whatever. But I don't want to -- I don't diminish it. But as far as 2019 goes, we're not thinking about any major competitive issues that we're going to face in any of our key areas or key geographies right now.","We think this will take some time for them to ramp. We've talked about this before. This business is not easy. You have to be able to hit on a lot of cylinders. You got to have a good sales force that touches the customers and can make that doctor feel really strong about the product line.","Secondly, you have to have really good treatment planning and consistent treatment planning that can deliver. And third, you got to have an operation organization that can deliver these things in sequence and on time and on high quality. And putting those things together is difficult. And so 2019, we're not factoring in a huge amount of what we think is competitive pressure.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, got. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Erin Wright","Hey, thanks. A couple of international ones here. I guess, can you speak to the dynamics in terms of fundamental demand trends in China given the broader macro dynamics? And could you also speak to the competitive landscape and how that's evolving there? And then also on Brazil, just as you build out that market, any sort of surprises there that you're seeing in the broader traction in Brazil?","Joseph Hogan","Yes. Erin, it's Joe. From a China standpoint, look, our demand there has been great. I think as I talked about in my opening, it's a really underpenetrated marketplace. And so -- and there's a lot of demand for our product lines. So our manufacturing investments we're making there, our treatment planning, all those things that make us a local company, we think will allow us to really penetrate that market at a higher rate.","So look, I mean, we're not numb to the international scene right now, where people are concerned about China demand. We don't have anything to report right now that would say that we have a diminishing or a paranoia over China demand as we go into 2019. As far as competition over there, Erin, Angela Align is the most credible competitor that we have there.","I would say that Angel has really focused on kind of Tier 3 cities in areas of China where we really focused on in the first 5 years or so of our logistics in China in Tier 1 or two cities, and moved into Tier 3. We don't feel that Angel is throttling our growth there at all. They are a fast follower. We see them in different areas that come after us.","But we -- there's not a whole lot of head-to-head competition we feel right now, and I think that reflects not a whole lot about Angel being either good or bad. It just reflects the size of this marketplace and the investments you have to make in the sales force, how you really have to service that marketplace.","There's a lot of work that you have to do. The channels just don't exist right now in the sense that you have to build those channels and really make them viable. So right now, we consider them a competitor and our largest competitor, I'd say, in the world, in the sense of a number of clear aligners that they supply. We don't look at them right now as slowing us down in China. And the Brazil surprise.","I'd say that the surprises were always in Brazil. It's the Incredible uptake of our product line there. You saw the 1,300 doctors that we've trained there recently. They're so excited about the product line. It's -- we talked about Spain often in the sense of the uptick of our product in Spain and the growth there. We see the same kind of enthusiasm and the same kind of, what I would call, Latin enthusiasm for what our product can do and really bring to that area.","So we look to make major investments there and increasing our sales force and our presence in the Brazilian area. We really feel good about Brazil from a standpoint of future growth of our product aligner.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. And a broader question on promotional activity. I'm just curious kind of what other promotional activity could you implement that isn't necessarily prized-driven, whether the co-marketing arrangements or other types of incentives. Is this something that it is in your game plan for 2019 or something that you're planning?","Joseph Hogan","Erin, there's no lack of creativity in our commercial forces as promotions go, so there's a lot of adult supervision that we have to supply as we do those things. And what -- you can look at our [Adapt] program as a good one. That's a program where we're trying to take doctors to 80% Invisalign and really demonstrate, as I mentioned in my opening, is that when you get to a digital practice, when you get to 80%, first of all, no one goes back, no one goes back to wires and brackets.","You really set a precedent that you have control over your practice. You don't have 30% of your cases resulting in emergencies. Doctors aren't spending 45 minutes a day with patients. It's just a much -- but you have to get to 80% to make that work. We'll continue to put money into that. That's not like a promotional program that we would offer at a lower price.","That's just a program we work with docs that really want to get there. There's always promotional programs that we do that we offer aligners to staff at orthos that are starting up with us or also with GPs or whatever so that they can understand the product and have that experience and be able to communicate that well to patients. They come into the practice. Those are ongoing promotions that we do in all 3 geographies, too.","We do have seasonal promotions at times in different countries at different areas. But I'd say that we have a -- this is outside of the third quarter issue obviously we reported on kind of ad nauseam over the last 6 months. We have a good handle right now on what promotions that we'll offer throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ravi Misra","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to get into the kind of the gross margin outlook in the commentary that you were providing. Can you help us understand maybe what the pushes and takes are between the 1Q guidance and kind of the 4Q guidance ramp?","And especially in terms of what's that fixed overhead that's strapped there, kind of the ball park? Is that somewhere around $10 million, $15 million a quarter right now that's annualized into your COGS on that that's going to fall off once the China sales ramp?","John Morici","Yes. Ravi, it's John. It's not that high. But when we think of our operation that we've had to date, really it's been a -- it's treatment planning in Costa Rica, and it's been manufacturing in Mexico. We are now -- as we've been expanding our treatment planning and now expanding out to China manufacturing, it's -- we want volume. We want to better push volume through those centers and get as much productivity as possible.","So as we see some of the volume in -- the margin impact in the fourth quarter, that continues a bit into the fourth quarter. But as that volume comes through and as you don't have to add as much overhead, you see more and more productivity to be able to come through those whether the treatment planning or the China manufacturing. And so we expect to see this kind of quarter-over-quarter of improvement through 2019 as we get more and more productive at these facilities.","Ravi Misra","So it sounds like that's really going to be led by a step-up in the clear aligner gross margin versus the scanners?","John Morici","Yes, definitely. When you look at kind of where we're seeing that volume leverage as we expand out globally, it'll be on the clear aligners side, and we should see that progress through the year.","Ravi Misra","Right. And then maybe just 2 more questions. Just on the -- one on the orthodontics and then another kind of just on the consultations through the Invisalign brand experience. So just on the orthodontics step-down. I'm curious. That's the first time in, gosh, I think about 12, 14 quarters. I've seen that number stepped down.","Any kind of impact -- I know you're saying that the impact from Ormco. 3M was kind of limited. But how about some of the other direct-to-consumer manufacturers there? Is that playing into that at all? And in the sense that, that end-user volume might actually be going down?","And then second, you talked about the 85 -- I think the 85,000 people that have visited the store and gotten a consult. What's the conversion rate on that? Are those getting scans to actually becoming consumers of your product?","Joseph Hogan","Ravi, Joe again. From a standpoint of Americas and orthodontics standpoint, again, I'll tell you we had our second best year in history following from the standpoint of overall orthodontic growth. When you talk about SDC, my feeling on SDC is they don't really take orthodontic cases. Remember, the normal orthodontist in the United States is 75% to 80% teen. You won't see many teens being done by SDC, and so those cases would primarily come out of GPs. Adults, kind of simple cases that are going on.","As I mentioned, we had our highest GP sales rate ever in North America in 2018. So neither of those dimensions do I think that we or experience competition enthralling the business in some way whether it will affect us in 2019. As far as the Invisalign stores and the scan ratios, all those things, look, we just -- we're still working through this as well.","We haven't released that information from an overall standpoint yet, and at some point in time when we think we're ready and we really have that ironed out. And I'd say that, Ravi, not that we're hiding anything. It's just we found that when you look at CCAs, we call it clear order in this business, this can take anywhere from 4 to 6 months to 7 months to really iron itself out.","We see patients going and get scanned. And then there's a huge halo effect because when we do this local advertising, it benefits not just the doctors in the program but also in a broader sense, any doctor that's within that 10-mile or 15-mile range.","So when we're really -- when we're ready to report this, we'll report it in a broad sense to that halo effect, the whole, what you talked about, the conversion rate and also what that means from a timing standpoint, okay?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed.","John Kreger","Thanks. Joe, a few times on the call, I think you talk about your view that it's sort of critical to get your customers to really make the digital conversion of their practices. Can you just talk a bit more about what that really means? And is that an expense on your part? Obviously, it's got some positive implications for volumes if and when it happens. But what are the sort of practical implications of getting an ortho practice to make that transition? Thanks.","Joseph Hogan","John, that's a good question. There's 3 key parameters, right, is first of all, there's extended payment terms that you have to deal with. Because when you go with a clear aligner product versus wires and brackets, their cost overall are about 4x from a variable cost standpoint of which you'd have with wires and brackets. So you just have to get ready for that cash play and try in some way to extend those kinds of payments.","Secondly, you have to look at their workflows. Because when you really go to a full digital practice, it changes completely really. We find out in our [Adapt] program that you need fewer chairs but you'd need more consultation rooms to put people in, to show them simulations, to talk them through what it would be.","With no emergency cases, it completely redefines in the sense of how a day goes in a doctor's office. It's not 30% of the time are people scrambling around trying to find someone that can fix something to occur with wires and brackets in some way.","And then third is a demand component, is you're going to have to drive more demand within that practice, which Invisalign does. And so obviously, with $100 million spend that we do a year in attracting patients and moving them into doctors, how we pipe those patients into doctors, how they prepare themselves for both teens and adults to do that.","So it's on those 3 dimensions. And John, specifically on the Adapt program, we're just going through that program right now and how we'll offer that to customers and whether it will cost to actually do that to customers at that point. And after we've done probably 5 to 8 of these and have them complete, we'll have a better story in the sense of -- a more complete story in the sense of here is how we'll do it, what those costs will be.","But don't look at those as being overly broad. Remember, we have iPro today that we basically use to take customers through clinical kind of episodes. So we have our concierge service that grabs patients to move them through doctors, too.","So the big components of operations that you need to work around the Adapt , we have those in place. We just have to modify them more to this 80% or digital treatment play.","John Kreger","Very helpful. One quick one, John. As you think about the '19 outlook that you described for us, what sort of number of stores is that envisioned by year-end?","John Morici","Yes, we have 12 as we noted now. It's really not a material change from that. We're evaluating what's best locations, what makes sense for us. But we really want to drive productivity and conversion at the stores we have before we go on a larger scale.","John Kreger","Okay. So we shouldn't expect that to be materially different by December of '19?","John Morici","That's correct.","John Kreger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks, good afternoon, everybody. So I guess just given the ramp in investments in 2019, likely some slower EPS growth. I kind of feel that 2019 is maybe somewhat similar to what Align went through back in 2015, where that was, let's call it, somewhat of a throwaway year for earnings growth because of heavy spending.","But then the company came out of that and really had 3 strong years of growth in 2016 through 2018. I know it's a different management team back in 2015. But should we draw really any sort of parallels through 2019? Or maybe you're just setting yourself up for another strong earnings growth cycle in the next couple of years beyond 2019 with the investments that you're making this year?","Joseph Hogan","Steve, it's Joe. I think first of all, I'd say we play offense in this business. So even though we talk about restructuring or if we talk about adding salespeople, when we talk about defending our IP, all of those things are, to me, setting a foundation for future growth in the business.","When you sit back and you look at this business, we're incredibly underpenetrated based on consumer preference for clear aligners to move teeth and also the size of the market that digital opens up even beyond, the 12 million orthodontic case starts that we talk about globally.","So please don't call 2019 a throwaway year. Hopefully, the earnings and the growth that we're projecting here are substantial. And we haven't even mentioned the law of large number on you guys over the last 3 years, right? Because we continue to build these huge percentages over top incredibly larger numbers than what we had previously.","So I look at this as -- don't -- look at is as these are aggressive investments in a young business to lay a foundation to allow us to be better in the future. And that's -- we have to take these.","Steven Valiquette","Yes. I guess a quick follow-up to that, which is the, how important is consistent EPS growth at Align at this stage of the corporate life cycle? Or it's just still mainly about driving top line growth for all the things that you just mentioned?","John Morici","Steve, this is John. It's both. I mean, we want to drive top line. We want to be able to grow this business. As Joe mentioned, we're vastly underpenetrated, and we have products and technology to be able to increase that market. But at the same time, we want to be able to grow profitably.","And as we layer on some of these investments, we expect -- whether it's China or sales force addition or others that we're adding in, over time, we'll be able to see those benefits. And that over time, as we laid out, is over 2019. We should see that sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter as those investments start to pay off as we move forward.","But we want to make sure that we're returning the most back to our shareholders, and that comes from revenue growth and the volume that we drive as well as doing this from a profitability standpoint. And we're very aware of the long-term growth model, and we stick with that.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, got. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Steve. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB-Leerink. Please proceed.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I was just wondering -- I know you guys are still -- it's still really, really early days in China, and the opportunities are enormous, including your growth rate in that region, haven't really shown any slowdown. But can you just talk a little bit about what -- we've seen some headlines and some other companies talking about the macro slowdown in China and the consumer discretionary realm.","Can you give us your thoughts from the way you see things? Clearly, you're investing, so I would imagine there's nothing there that would suggest there's any slow in growth. But what are you seeing kind of at the ground level in terms of the macro?","Joseph Hogan","I mean, we - like I mentioned before, Richard, this is -- the growth that we saw throughout 2018 was really strong in China. I mean, obviously, we're making these investments in China. It's a commitment. They are the second largest country in the world right now. The under-penetration, the opportunity there is huge.","Look, I mean, we're up with global events. We see the issues going on with China and United States. And hopefully, they'll come to a trade deal sooner or later. I look at that investment. When I talked about manufacturing there, it is moving closer and having a Chinese business and being able to operate in that country with a lot of fluidity. But it also makes me feel good that we have a good insurance policy in the sense of the trade dynamics between the two countries, too.","So right now, again, we haven't seen what other companies are reporting. I think the penetration piece we're talking about is probably maybe the variable of difference between the two.","We're not saying that we're recession-proof ever. I think that's a ridiculous position to take. But what we've seen right now in the growth rates and what we've been experiencing, right now, we're looking for a good 2019 in China.","Richard Newitter","Excellent. And just if you could maybe just -- maybe you mentioned it earlier, mandibular advancement. What's contemplated? Or how are you thinking about the contribution in 2019? Should we think of that launch kind of hitting the ground running right off the bat? Is that more of a gradual cadence? And what's contemplated in the outlook?","Joseph Hogan","I'll take the high level of it. John, take the specific level. But remember, MAF was just approved in November of 2018. As you can see, we have -- I expect our normal uptick in the United States, which is -- what those will do, 2 or 3 cases and get used to it. It's a phenomenal product. It really is.","To think you straighten your teeth. It can move your mandible forward in that sense and build bone. It's just -- it's incredible. But when it's something that big and that revolutionary, doctors -- orthos are conservative anyway. And obviously, they're going to take their time in the sense of proving it. Now [indiscernible] MAF has been outside the United States for a while, too.","So we have, I think, 17,000 cases we talked about that we've gone through it. What's really interesting, too, is we have several updates from [Jelco] and the engineering team on MAF also. When teeth are shorter, how you arrange your aligners to make it work, making sure the wings are a lot stronger than before. So this is approved in the United States. We think we've significantly improved the product over the last 12 months, too.","Now we find, too, is just the great halo effect around MAF and Teen. If you start to do more MAF, you do more Teen. And so we're looking forward to that. But again, it's new days in the United States, and we'll give you updates as we go through the year.","John Morici","And so when we look at our forecast and we think about flat ASPs, this is one that helps us. This is a positive move back to our ASPs because it's a full case, it's a teen case, it's complicated. Like Joe said, it gives us more and more teen volume, and we look at that as favorable mix and favorable growth for us.","Shirley Stacy","Okay.

We encourage listeners to review these items.","We\u2019ve also posted a set of GAAP and non-GAAP historical financial statements including the corresponding reconciliation and our second quarter conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Align Technology\u2019s President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?","Tom Prescott","","Thanks Shirley. Good afternoon everyone. On the call today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner & CAD\/CAM Services. Ken will discuss our Q2 financial results and outlook for Q3 in more detail and then I\u2019ll come back with a few closing comments and open the call up to questions.","The second quarter was another great one for Align and I am pleased to report strong results for revenue, operating margin and EPS all better than our outlook. During the quarter, strong Invisalign volume grew across all products, customer channels and geographies, reflecting continued increase in Invisalign utilization. Our Scanner & CAD\/CAM Services business in North America also grew nicely this quarter and continues to exceed our expectations, while scanner sales in Europe remain challenging and our disappointing results there continue.","For Q2, total Invisalign case volume was 95.3000, an increase of 12% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by growth in all customer channels. From a product view, Invisalign Full and Invisalign Express which includes Invisalign Express 5 launched last quarter drove sequential and year-over-year growth.","Invisalign Express 5 are five stage aligner offering for very simple cases, is hitting the right value point in the market in getting some traction with patients who want to correct a little crowding or spacing, but believe current comprehensive orthodontic treatment is just too expensive for minor correction. They are primarily seeing Invisalign Express 5 usage from our more experienced customers both Ortho\u2019s and GPs alike. These docs are pricing this treatment from around $1,200 to $1,800 a case which is helping them treat more patients and expand the market.","For North America orthodontists, Q2 case volume of 35.4000, cases increased 10% from Q1 and 24% year-over-year driven primarily from increased utilization of all Invisalign products. We believe utilization growth is a result of an improved product efficacy from new features and functionality in Invisalign G4 as well as increased patient demand for Invisalign stemming from our consumer and marketing initiatives. We also saw a good growth in Invisalign Teen product in Q2 reflecting our continued progress in the overall teenage Ortho segment.","For North American GP dentist, Q2 case volume of 37.3000, cases increased 13% from Q1 and 21% year-over-year. This quarter we saw another record number of GP submitters combined with an increase in product utilization as our base of GP customers continue to expand and use of Invisalign increased across the board. As described a moment ago, Invisalign Express was up nicely for our GP customers in Q2, reflecting the recent launch of Invisalign Express 5.","The teenage orthodontic market, which for us consist of teenagers, 11 and 19 years old using any Invisalign product is the largest segment of orthodontic case starts and represents a great opportunity for us to continue taking share from existing wires and brackets case starts.","Q2 was a strong quarter for teenagers using Invisalign, with the total number of teens starting treatment at 20.3000, or 21.3% of worldwide cases. This is an increase of 13% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, a nice increase from the same quarter last year when total teenagers grew 7% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.","Invisalign Teen product is primarily targeted at younger teens, 11 to 15 and has specific features such as compliance indicators interruption tabs to address the needs of younger patients. For Q2, Invisalign Teen case shipments were 11.9000, cases, an increase of 19% sequentially and 38% year-over-year, very positive indications of our continued progress.","Both Orthos and GPs took advantage of the Invisalign Teen\/Vivera Retainer promotion during this quarter, which includes a free Vivera Retainer subscription for every Invisalgin Teen case customer buys. The objective of this promotion is to drive penetration of Invisalign in the teenage ortho segment during the summer season and generate broader trial and use of Vivera Retainers.","During Q3 last year when we first offered the Teen\/Vivera promotion, we saw a strong uptick in Invisalign Teen cases and since then, the doctors who participated in the promotion have subsequently continued to grow their case volumes consistently. In addition, Vivera Retainer volume has accelerated steadily as well because of the success we saw last year in case volume and doctor behavior. Given that impact we just tried to initiate the promotion in May, a month earlier than last year in order to have the offering in place for the entire teenage peak summer season.","For international doctors Q2 case volume of 22.6000, cases increased 13% from Q1 and 35% year-over-year driven primarily by growth in our direct business in Europe as well as by continued strong performance by our APAC distributor. In Europe, we had good growth across all countries led by the UK where growth has resumed and where we continue to make good progress with both Ortho\u2019s and GPs.","During the quarter, we launched Invisalign i7 in the UK, a seven stage aligner offering for minor crowding and spacing. Much like Invisalign Express 5 in North America, Invisalign i7 increases the treatment options for doctors with a cost effective product that is specifically designed for minor tooth moving. Additionally, Invisalign team grew nicely this quarter in Europe and has begun to gain traction in teenage market albeit off a small base.","We also had very nice growth from China and Japan; Q2 marks the one year anniversary of our commercial launch in China where we are successfully executing our focused strategy of working in the top four cities with key opinion leaders and leading orthodontists. Over the past year, we have successfully launched Invisalign 4 and Invisalign Teen in China.","We have made great strides of those KOLs and top doctors and established a strong base of local advocate or gaining access to the pricing system of numerous major public and university hospitals. We are also seeing good traction from recent initiatives to train Chinese doctors and help them develop the skills and knowledge to build their Invisalign business. Overall, interest in Invisalign is high and we remain very optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity there in China.","Q2 growth for our Invisalign distribution partners continues to be driven by our APAC partner. Our other partners in the EMEA and Latin America are also doing well and continue to expand their customer base and drive for utilization growth. Our Invisalign distribution partners represent an important long-term growth lever, but I will point out that they are only about 3% of our total worldwide revenue today. Continued adoption across our customer base in Q2 is reflected in our Invisalign metrics of utilization and new customer training.","Overall, utilization rates remain strong across all channels particularly among North America Ortho\u2019s. As expected, we trained more GPs this quarter typical for us as we offer fewer CE1 courses in Q1. In addition almost half of the total number of new doctors trained in Q2 were international doctors reflecting our continued growth and expansion outside North America.","Now let's turn to consumer demand where our integrated consumer marketing platform combines paid media like print, broadcast and digital along with a mix of PR, event marketing and social media outreach. The goal of this platform is to raise awareness in Invisalign and Invisalign Teen as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among adults and teens and their parents particularly moms. In addition, it is important for us to help these potential patients find a great practice that can meet their needs.","Activity in our consumer website is a good measure of progress on this front; perspective patients can get more information, take an interactive smile assessment and search for Invisalign providers in their area. At the end of Q2, we had nearly 3 million visitors to Invisalign.com to-date this year up 40% from the same period in 2011.","Website leads are up 45% from this time last year and we continue to see increasing traffic from mobile device users particularly when our ads are running on TV. We launched Invisalign.com mobile site at the end of June to leverage this traffic with the site optimized for mobile visitors particularly those on smartphones. Website traffic like many of our consumer metrics is positively influenced by our on air TV presence. In Q2, we began leveraging the peak Teen season by running our twins TV commercials to reach moms and teens. ","We will be on air with these commercials through the end of August with a short break between the Olympics at the end of July. Our TV presence during the importance summer month is supplemented by radio, digital and traditional PR and event marketing including our second year sponsoring Radio Disney\u2019s next big thing tour which includes elements of all those marketing channel. ","We began running Radio Disney spots in Q2 and officially kicked off this year's tour on July 1 in Chicago market. And with the online launch of the Disney Invisalign Teen straight up celebrations sweepstakes which will run into the tour end in December. We expect another successful year with this Disney initiative as it gives us an opportunity to reach the very engaged Disney teen audience and their parents at local market events and through Disney\u2019s radio, TV and online properties. ","On the public relations front, we are continuing to target both moms and adult female audiences through editorial coverage that not only builds awareness for our brand but also educates about the benefits of treatment. One of our most recent examples from our PR effort on this front was a very nice segment on the CBS day time talk show \"The Doctors\" which aired on July 10 on the \u201cHide It, Fix It, Flaunt It\u201d episode. ","The segment which featured Invisalign patient and her doctor talking about treatment reached the show\u2019s audiences of more than 3 million viewers. If you would like to see the clip search for Invisible Braces for Crooked Teeth or you can reference the link in today's webcast slides. ","Consumer demand initiatives have always been an important part of our strategy for market expansion and sustained growth in North America. Over the past few years, we've also been laying the foundation for direct-to-consumer advertising in appropriate markets in Europe. ","Now given these economic times, it may seem counter intuitive but it's really an opportune time for us to establish our brand, build awareness and get placements in the lower cost in this area. So we have started to implement programs in select country markets such as our recent launch of TV advertising in Spain, in the UK with an integrated marketing campaign around our sponsorship of the UK version of the bachelor TV show and the continued success of the right white campaign in Germany featuring former football star Matthias Sammer. ","All of these are serving to help educate teens and their parents. Combined with good PR in digital marketing activities across the EU markets, all of these integrated marketing elements are designed to help raise awareness of Invisalign as the best treatment option and is very under penetrated market.","Moving on to our scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment, Q2 revenue was $11.9 million compared with $11.8 million in Q1 a slight increase from Q1 which reflected strong North American scanner sales offset by lower service revenue in international scanner sales. Our scanner business continues to exceed our expectations in North America. ","We are gaining leverage from the combined efforts of our scanner and Invisalign sales team, especially major in Invisalign events including the [AAO] meeting in May and several customer reforms all across the US in Q2 which were primarily for GP dentists. ","All-in-all we are seeing terrific progress in North America, almost good enough to offset some of the performance gap in Europe. It appears that capital equivalent market remains soft in Europe we are just not satisfied with our execution and results in this area and are working to remedy the situation. ","Given these challenges over the near-term, we are not expecting any significant improvement from our scanner and CAD\/CAM services business in this region. With the majority of our New Jersey consolidation completed, we have posed most in the gaps in scanner customer service, technical support and delivery that I mentioned last quarter which were felt most acutely by legacy iTero customers. ","Our continued evolution in hardware and software applications along with our maturing customer support resources we will take care of any remaining matters over the next quarter or so.","We\u2019re making great progress on product, systems and technology. As our strategy evolves, our near-term focus is on maximizing Invisalign leverage both in driving new scanner sales as well as increasing adoption, utilization of Invisalign. This Invisalign inter-operability became available. We\u2019ve seen digital impressions begin to replace traditional PVS impressions. ","As of Q2, 12.8% of North American cases were submitted with a digital impression from an iTero iOC scanner instead of PVS impression. This is up from 9.2% last quarter and 5.9% in Q4 of 2011. The trend towards accelerating digitization is very positive as Invisalign is one of the very few treatment modalities in dentistry that relies fully upon digital technologies. This trend also benefits our customers as it reduces cycle time, eliminates (inaudible), and results in more positive experience for their patients.","As we invest and accelerate product development, we will launch high value applications like the Outcome Simulator, expected later this year along with even more applications to follow.","We know its working well in the scanner business. We see everyday in North America. We have an opportunity to replicate that success elsewhere. We are committed to investing the time and resources needed and knowing to get things back on track in Europe. I will now turn the call over to Ken for a review of our Q2 financial results. Ken?","Ken Arola","","Thanks, Tom. Before I get started, I would like to remind everyone that there are several items that we exclude from our GAAP results when we report non-GAAP results. These include acquisition and integration related costs, amortization of intangible assets and severance and benefit cost for the New Jersey consolidation. ","In my comments today, I will not review the total dollars excluded for non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense and operating margin and instead we refer you to the press release table of reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP key financial metrics and the business outlook summary for a complete reconciliation. Now let's turn to the second quarter financial results beginning with revenue. ","In Q2, net revenue was a total of $145.6 million which consisted of Invisalign revenue of a $133.7 million and scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue of $11.9 million. This is a sequential increase of 7.8% from $135.1 million in Q1 2012, and a year-over-year increase of 21.3% from $120.1 million in Q2 2011. ","Q2 Invisalign revenue of $133.7 million increased 8.4% compared to Q1 revenue of $123.3 million and increased 17.6% compared to Q2 2011 revenue of $113.6 million. A sequential increase in Q2 revenue was driven by Invisalign volume growth in all channels and products. This was partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs resulting from advantage rebate, promotional activity, product mix and to a lesser extend foreign exchange rates.","On year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign revenue growth was driven by volume increases in all channels and products. Q2 scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue of $11.9 million increased from $11.8 million in Q1 and was driven by North America scanner sales. Q2 2011 revenue of $6.4 million included two months of scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue as we posed the acquisition of Cadent Holdings Inc. on April 29, 2011. ","Now moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Q2 GAAP gross margin was a $108.8 million or 74.7% this compares to a $100.8 million or 74.6% in Q1 and $91.1 million or 75.9% in the same quarter last year. Due to GAAP gross margin for Invisalign was 79% and scanner and CAD\/CAM services was 26.6%. This compares to 79% and 28.7% respectively in quarter one. ","Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was $109.2 million or 75%. This compares to $101.5 million or 75.1% in quarter one and $91.4 million or 76.1% in the same quarter last year. The benefit from increased Invisalign volumes was offset by lower ASPs. In Invisalign there was no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 or Q1 of 2012 and Q2 of 2011. ","For scanner and CAD\/CAM services Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 30.3% compared to 34.6% last quarter. Q2 GAAP operating expenses remain flat at $72.8 million compared to Q1 operating expenses. Operating expenses for the same quarter last year were $74.5 million. Q2 non-GAAP operating expense was $71.6 million and this compares to $71.1 million in quarter one and $68.1 million in the same quarter last year. ","Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses remains relatively flat from Q1 and reflects a sequential increase in media spend to get in front of the teenage summer season offset by lower compensation related expenses, consulting expenses and some deferred headcounts. Q2 GAAP operating income was $36 million or 24.7% and this compares to $28 million or 20.7% in quarter one and $16.6 million or 13.8% in the same quarter a year ago. ","Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $37.6 million or 25.8%. This compares to $30.3 million or 22.4% in quarter one and 23.3 million or 19.4% in the same quarter last year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34 compared to $0.26 in quarter one and $0.14 in the same quarter last year. Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.34 compared to $0.27 in quarter one and $0.20 in Q2 of last year.","Now moving on to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities including long-term investments were $304 million. This is compared to $257.2 million at the end of 2011. In Q2, we generated roughly $27.3 million in cash from operations compared to $15.4 million in quarter one and $29.7 million in the same quarter last year. ","Q2 DSOs were 63 days compared to 63 days in quarter one and 62 days the same quarter last year. Overall, Q2 was another strong quarter and the first half of the year has been outstanding. Our business continues to be very healthy and we are confident we will continue to build on this over the remainder of the year.","Now let\u2019s turn to our business outlook for Q3 2012 and the factors that inform our view. As we enter Q3, we continue to see solid patient traffic and activity in our customer\u2019s offices. Our North America Ortho\u2019s are busy with new teenage case starts and we expect Q3 to be a strong teen quarter for Invisalign. ","For North American GPs we expect seasonality to be a factor as we are anticipating doctors will have less in office days due to vacations. Our international doctors had a great first half of the year stronger than expected and we anticipate Q3 to be a slower period particularly for Southern Europe countries where many customers take extended summer holidays. ","As a result, Invisalign case volume as it is anticipated to be in a range of 94,800 to 96,300 cases which reflects a year-over-year increase of 19.5% to 21.3%. This compares to a year-over-year increase of 25.3% in quarter two 2012 and 19.8% in quarter three 2011. Our Invisalign shipment volumes are an important metric pointing to the continued progress and strength of the business.","For Q3, we expect the scanner and CAD\/CAM service business to be down sequentially from quarter two, give summer seasonality for capital equipment purchases. In addition there are no major industry or Invisalign customer events in quarter three that would give us additional selling opportunities like we had in Q2 with the AAO in May as an example.","We also expect Q3 scanner sales in Europe to be flat. With that as a backdrop, we expect Q3 revenues to be in a range of $136.8 to a $140.8 million. Overall revenues reflect lower Invisalign ASPs resulting from deferrals associated with the Invisalign Teen\/Vivera Retainer promotion, Advantage rebates and headwinds from foreign exchange rates.","Now let's move on to gross margin. We expect Q3 GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 73.4% to 73.8% and we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 73.6% to 74.1%. The expected sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin reflects lower Invisalign ASPs as just mentioned. In Q3 we expect GAAP operating expense to be in a range of $71.7 million to $72.4 million. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expense to be in a range of $70.6 million to $ 71.3 million, slightly down from Q2.","We expect Q3 GAAP operating margins to be a range of 21% to 22.4% and GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.28. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating margin to be in a range of 22% to 23.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29.","In Q3 we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $83.5 million and cash on hand to be in the range of $345 million to 355 million.","With that I will now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments.","Tom Prescott","Thanks, Ken. Overall Q2 was another outstanding quarter for Align. As you can see from our results there are a lot of good things going on in our business with visible progress in virtually every area of the company. Our doctors' offices remain busy and while we are anticipating the combination of a slower summer period and some promotional activity lowering Q3 revenue a bit, our outlook for Invisalign volume growth of 20% plus year over year is even higher than reported in Q3 last year and demonstrates our continued growth and adoption and utilization worldwide.","We continue to be content about the future due to our low market penetration, outstanding offerings and solid execution of a winning strategy. We are committed to tracking towards our long-term financial model with the right combination of revenue and earnings growth. I look forward to sharing this continued progress with you at the end of Q3.","And with that I will open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Matt Dolan with Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead.","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","So the first question is looking at the Q3 guidance. You know I think you mentioned a survey on the last call; clearly the teenage segment is building here into the summer season. Last year we didn't see as much seasonality as you're implying with your guidance. So maybe you can talk through what's new on the international side and the GP side that would make this year unique?","Ken Arola","Yeah, I guess. I will start with Matt is if you think back a year ago, coming off of quarter two particularly in International, we typically see some nice growth Q1 to Q2. Growth was a lot less in quarter two last year which growing off that base into the summer months, we actually had an increase in revenues during that summer month with international business.","Its different this year in the fact that we had what I would call more of normal Q2 for us, as far as the volume was there from the doctors. All quarter long, we saw some long good strength in Europe this last quarter and now rolling into the summer, we are looking at going back to what we would normally see or typically see which is doctors being at the office on holidays and not seeing that same growth we saw last year. So that was the main part of it.","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","Okay and then domestically?","Ken Arola","Domestically GPs, depending on the summer they have been up and they have been down. Last year was some nominal growth in GPs on a quarter-over-quarter basis and this year we are again expecting it to be kind of the same.","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","The second question is on China. We get this a lot, so wanted to relay it on to you on this call. It seems like you know International is healthy, can you quantify or give us any type of direction to how much is coming you know beyond Europe?","Tom Prescott","You know I think Matt I will take that. Qualitatively first, China is a very small part of our \u2013 its small today in revenue. It's large in terms of opportunity and so this idea of going very, very slowly to build the right base, so we can go faster later is still a very important theme. It's still a very small contributor to top line that will change say over a five-year period substantially. You know I am just trying to find a right way we describe this. In general those smaller geographies outside the US are growing more rapidly than International in general which is growing more rapidly than North America. If I would stack it up that way, is that good to answer your question?","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","Yeah, sure and we will follow up later. And then the last one on your duplicative costs with this transition in New Jersey, are those stripped out of your non-GAAP results, are those, would those be a further cost reduction, I think about down the road and if so maybe you can help us understand how much those might be on a go forward basis?","Ken Arola","Yeah, so costs in relation to duplicative costs of employees and those types of things. Those are in our non-GAAP numbers. The only thing we pull up from a GAAP to non-GAAP are severance associated costs and the like. As far as the consolidation is concerned itself, New Jersey consolidation. We talked a while back about being able to enjoy about a $1 million cost savings per quarter, about $4 million a year as we complete that transition.","It looks like we are right on track with that as far as the cost reduction with the move itself. What we will see coming into play here is the fact that in the scanner business as it's been growing in particular in North America very nicely, we've had to add more trainers in to do the installs of the units in doctors' offices and that's going to be an offset a bit to the cost savings we've seen with the New Jersey consolidation.","And then with the more recent issues we've been dealing with the Ichiro system and doctors in the marketplace with a customer service point of view, we've actually had to layer in some additional resources to get after that from a customer care and a technical support point of view and that will be also some offset to the savings that we are (inaudible) enjoy.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Kreger - William Blair","Can you just review what's driving the lower ASPs both in your second quarter results and what seems to be implied in Q3 guidance?","Ken Arola","That was one of the, there is a couple of drivers here in Q2 and will continue into Q3. It has to do with our Advantage rebate program and also the Teen\/Vivera promotion more specifically and then in Q3 there's also the impact of foreign exchange rates more heavily on the business. That we can't do a lot about obviously. I will come back to the other two. ","So the Advantage program is a program we've been having, we've been in place for a number of years now and it really rewards the highest point in doctors and it\u2019s a good ROI for us because doctors submit more cases to us, but they enjoy a little bit of rebate associated with that but in all reality we don't put a lot of effort into supporting those particular doctors as we do a low volume doctor who needs a lot of customer care support and technical support in getting to the case.","So from an ROI perspective, it's a very positive program for us and it returns a nice profitability in relation to even doctors who are not getting any rebates. More specifically sometimes we run programs like the Teen\/Vivera promotion to drive volume and get doctors moving up in their number of cases there has been. We again as we said on our call, very successful last year and running the Teen\/Vivera promotion and we are running it again this year.","We started it a month earlier, that's very specific to the summer months here and as the doctor turns the case into us, a Teen case into us they will get to use a Vivera case between now and the end of March next year. There are some associated revenue deferrals with that because we are offering a Vivera case to the doctor along with the Teen part, so there's a bundling effect and we differ a portion of that revenue and we will get that revenue back as the doctor takes the Vivera case.","Tom Prescott","Hey John, if I can pile in for just a second. In general pricing is very stable for us globally, with the exception of that Baxter moment; most of the changes that are happening in ASP are because we are pulling on certain levers. Ken laid out a few of them. Overtime we will expect ASP to go down a bit more as mix evolves and with product like Express, and i7 and Express 5, those are incremental cases we probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten. They come with the roughly equivalent gross margins, but our market is expanding for us and will, so the visible ASP may go down. We are going to help you unpack that overtime. So you realize, it\u2019s not us necessarily losing price, it\u2019s an evolution of business.","John Kreger - William Blair","Question flipping over to the scanner and CAD\/CAM services business, can you just update us on what\u2019s driving the declining gross margin and as you complete the integration, can we expect that to start trending up again?","Ken Arola","Yeah John, so Q1 to Q2 gross margin decline had to with a couple of specific items. First of all, we revised our standards on the scanners. In fact at the end of quarter four and we had units shipping in quarter four that we actually didn\u2019t recognize revenue, till quarter one they had lower standard costs associated with them and that\u2019s because we do the install with the doctor and that\u2019s the point in time we recognize revenue.","With the revised standards, we have actually increased a little bit. We had an additional manufacturing resources would increase the standards a bit. We see that coming through and shipments we made for the remainder of quarter one and into quarter two now that scanners are getting installed at just a little higher costs.","The other piece of it is, we have been adding resources and trainers over the past few quarters and you see the impact of that and that has to do with making sure we can support the number of scanners we\u2019re placing in North America and getting the doctors trained on that system. So those two things are some of the bigger drivers.","John Kreger - William Blair","","And then finally, can you just comment on the macro environment in Europe and how it might be impacting your business. It seems like the core Invisalign business continues to do surprisingly low, but Cadent faltering a little bit; either those really being impacted by the tougher backdrop?","Tom Prescott","","I am not going to hide behind the economy for a minute, let\u2019s talk Invisalign for just a moment. What we focused on Europe over the last year, year and a half is execution that we could control and if you remember, a year plus ago, we were struggling in the UK and in some other geographies, we\u2019ve in some cases reconstituted the sales team or the leadership of that country, re-looked at programs, in some cases like i7 have rolled out new products and we\u2019re growing again very nicely. UK led the international team this year in terms of individual country markets in Europe, and it\u2019s great to see.","The UK economic environment hasn\u2019t gotten better in the last year. So I would say that we have the benefit of better execution using that as an example and still a really low penetration. We saw lots of headroom for growth. And you know the example of Spain; we\u2019re growing very nicely in Spain and these are -- we\u2019re all watching the news everyday. So I think accepting the calamitous kind of financial outcome there, I believe in general we can continue to motor through this and find opportunities for growth with good execution. Doesn\u2019t mean things can't change.","On the scanner side, on the scanner side it\u2019s real hard to move the rock uphill because principally there is a piece of capital equipment that practitioners\u2019 don\u2019t need to buy today. They\u2019re doing physical impression, PBS and other impression materials today and this is about productivity and in a period of time when there is great uncertainty, the easier default is not to invest in this kind of new capital.","So I think that is a factor, but in addition, we\u2019re not where we want to be and we\u2019re working very hard with our partner on that and I believe overtime we\u2019re going to be able to make that better; but I think there is also different from the Invisalign business, there is execution that hasn\u2019t turned it around yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","I just want to follow up for a minute on John\u2019s ASP question; you know because it\u2019s clear that you have laid out a whole bunch of issues whether it be the FX issue, the rebate issue or the promotional opportunity; I was wondering Ken would you feel comfortable just kind of maybe isolating this FX issue to give us a sense for big it is so we can think about maybe what\u2019s within your control and not within your control as we model ASP up in the next couple quarters?","Ken Arola","Sure; if you think about FX, the impact to us this last quarter, if you look at the international business it was probably in that you know $5,00,000 to $600,000 range, so pretty small overall to the revenue base. But going forward looking at FX rates in particular for the year I am talking about that had been running around low 130\u2019s over the past several quarters and now bouncing around on the low 120\u2019s it will have a more pronounced impact on us from Q2 to Q3.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Okay, can you care to quantify that at all or\u2026.?","Ken Arola","Well, we haven\u2019t given you specifics on our revenues for international, so I don\u2019t want to make a comment specifically on that.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Okay, can I may be assume that based on the guidance you\u2019ve kind of given us today you kind of assume that the year remains in the low 120s?","Ken Arola","You know I think that\u2019s a fair call; what we look at is where the rates have been running as we come into the quarter just before earnings and we are looking at our guidance for the quarter and we make the best call we can, so I would say that's probably a fair range to be in.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Hey Tom, could you maybe talk a little bit more about the scanner business, you mentioned that you are starting to see some of the benefits of integrating the sales teams here in North America, you know could you quantify that or are you starting to -- could you elaborate a little bit more and the leverage you are seeing as a result of combination of the effort of those two sales forces?","Tom Prescott","Sure, I mean, we've got, we're headed tremendous 200 total people touching customers in North America and we are 30,000 plus customers in North America that we have good credible relationships with and it provides an opportunity to do some qualification and assessment of opportunity and then we really rather than dragging a scanner around individual offices, we use these events when we get them all together, study clubs, workshops, CE1s, CE2s, forums, summits and obviously trade shows where all the other vendors are in the room.","We've done a very good job of cross selling and working and the first job I think all of our owners said is don't take your eye of the Invisalign ball, so I think we've demonstrated, we didn't do that; but in addition we've got attention from our Invisalign customer base and quite a few of them are either having discussions or have already bought a scanner. So that's our best opportunity.","As we build the scanner sales force, we have roughly one scanner rep per region in the country and in large areas like LA or New York kind of two-ish or so; two or three. So they are very much a part of the daily rhythm with the Invisalign teams and a lot of open communication, a great amount of partnering.","So with kind of very little cultural effort the two teams have grown very close together and we are pretty efficient about finding opportunities and then using these environments where we've got a group of customers together that demo and close sales. We expect that to continue and I think if you look at the good start we had off for selling scanners last year we just expect overtime that\u2019s going to continue.","On the opposite side, the Invisalign side, we are just trying to get real leverage out of these accounts whether they be orthodontist or GP dentist that are now increasing utilization of Invisalign because it\u2019s easier and patients are happy and all those things. So that\u2019s just for interoperability and you see what\u2019s going on with the number of increasing cases from that.","When we start putting tools like the outcome simulator which we showed a little piece of during the Chicago mid-winter which will be out later this year, this is testing incredibly strong with our customers. They literally, when we demo with them to get some user interface information they don\u2019t want to take it off their scanner when it\u2019s time to leave. So there are other tools coming out that will make it much, much easier to interact with patients to case assessment and openly submit cases too I would say that it\u2019s really going to just reduce friction around the entire Invisalign experience.","And then on the whole restorative side there is a whole host of opportunities for us to leverage great enterprise environment; we have got it Invisalign, Align Technology where we literally communicate with 30,000, 40,000 customers everyday on a very robust external facing environment and we are starting with the best scanner in the world.","So from our perspectives, we have gotten past all the table stakes issues, now at a point as we start bringing out a flow of software and new hardware evolutions and capabilities that just gets better and better. So again, setting Europe aside there is whole set of issues we are working on, we are pretty excited by the broader set of opportunities that are evolving.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","And that\u2019s helpful, Tom if I can just ask you one last question then I\u2019ll hop off. I just want to quickly touch on the competitive landscape, as you guys kind of moved down the market a little bit towards i7 or the Express line, you start to get a little bit more in direct competition with where maybe [donor] or dentist like clear correct those guys are. Are you worried at all about the competitive landscape and the impact of that on pricing? Just what are you seeing in the market place?","Tom Prescott","","Well, first of all, Andy Grove said it best in \"Only the Paranoids Survive\" a great little book but if there is a combination of being confident and paranoid at the same time, maybe that definitely its schizophrenia, that\u2019s where we are. The great thing is why would anybody given a choice add a certain value point in the market settle for anything less than a best aligner product in the world. ","For any five stage or seven stage product, we should be able to move more efficiently to create the greatest and most predictable amount of movement for any inclusion you\u2019re trying to fix and so our view is we\u2019re not pricing our value products any different than what the market already has and (inaudible) told our variable cost per unit is probably lowest in the world. ","So we have a great deal of flexibility, the margins in those products are sound. These are market expanding and I think it\u2019s a good thing if other manufacturers are moving in this area, growing its just going to make it more acceptable for people to use clear liners, skills and we think that\u2019s market over time when. So, obviously we\u2019re paranoid about much bigger and better equipped players but the same talking we're completing through innovation and cycle time and speed and all that.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Spencer Nam from ThinkEquity. Please go ahead.","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","","Just a couple questions here. On the pricing, in the pricing side, I can understand why US pricing is coming down because of promotions and all that. But I also see your pricing coming down on the international market. It\u2019s been coming down fairly steady over the last couple of years and I was just wondering what's driving that?","Tom Prescott","","I have a couple of things driving, Spencer. First of all, foreign exchange rates. If you go back a year ago, the year was running in the low 140 to 144 to the dollar. Today it's running in the low 120s, 122, 123. That has a big impact on the year-over-year basis on the international side of the business. The couple of components, ROE introduced new products this last quarter called Invisalign I7 into the European market.","So as volume there grows instead of lower price point. So we will have some mix going on and also our distributors have been growing very nicely as we pointed to over the last several years and overall, the pricing point there is basically have the half list price in essence because they\u2019re selling a distributor pricing and they\u2019re taking care of all the customer issues. As a mix of the distributors grow internationally and that some of the lower price products grow over time, you we\u2019ll see more of an impact to ASP for a mix.","Ken Arola","","Hey, Spencer, on a kind of a net profitability perspective, our international partners even with the discounts for that. You know we don\u2019t have the offsetting support cost. So that falls through nicely as volume and then the second thing is that margins are comparable on these lower end offerings to our full teen and those other products.","So those are, other than FX which you would call a negative effect, everything else fits into our P&L nicely and the one expectation would be say, promotion in North America, or Europe were we run it which we would look at payback from that but in a period it might look like that\u2019s negative.","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","","And then on the promotions going on in the US, I think you guys are mindful of your competitive landscape but I was also wondering whether you guys, the part of the promotion was related to the competitive aspects that you know that you are trying to ensure their high volume, Invisalign physicians, dentists remain within Invisalign instead of jumping over to competitive so on and so forth. Is that calculated in your strategy of aggressively pushing the rebate program?","Tom Prescott","Every program, every promotion has its own rational and we look at what we trying to accomplish with it. In the Teen\/Vivera promotion it was not so much for competitive reasons, it was to expand the value and accomplish two objectives. The first I think I mentioned two minutes ago was if we can --- teen is the hardest share to gain because no orthodontist or dentists treating teens wants to do anything other than perfect for outcomes. ","They don\u2019t want to sacrifice any clinical advantage or leverage. So as we evolve Teen and the teen product in G3 G4 etcetera, we are cracking that more complex case now and helping that doctor deliver perfect their definition of perfect with mom or dad. ","The goal of anything we do to accelerate teen usage usually is a persistent effect office by office where they take advantage. So if we can get a good ROI on a program like Teen\/Vivera program and they do incrementally more teen cases during that busy season when they have got the highest patient flow for those teen starts, that utilization level remains and they move up from there. ","So when we look back a year ago, this is a persistent effect and therefore it is very virtuous, the payback is very positive. We get revenue deferral from that which we pick up couple of quarters later. The second thing that's really positive is we are trying to widen the base of repeat the very usage and so many of these orthodontists that bought Teen\/Vivera promotion or bought teen get Vivera, they hadn't used much of Vivera as they start getting really good feedback from patients they start ordering more Vivera. So the Vivera usage is also persistent and our goal is to widen the base of Vivera users which is happening so that program had two objectives both are being met and it was targeted right at the busy summer season, less so a competitive kind of dynamic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","","Tom, I wanted to drill down a bit more and a number of users in the quarter and the growth of the user base. We've talked about this before. This growth rate is very high and as you've commented before this is clearly borne out. You guys are doing a terrific job training not just more users but getting to people that are really going to fair very well with this system. How do you at this point to mention the sustainability of the growth of that user base, how long can that hold up and is there an upper bound in the US and in terms of the right base of users?","Tom Prescott","Let's break this into two pieces, Steve. The first is Orthos. We are, we think there's 9,000 to 10,000 practicing Orthos in North America and we are not, we are now just have 5,000 number in front of the submitters on an annual basis you know, it's taken us 13 years to get there. ","So we've got half of the active orthodontists in North America, we are not doing any business with and some of those practices are very desirable practices with you know high end, big volume and all that so that represents a long-term opportunity that where going to crack through continue to evolve the product in delivering great results, what we call predictability and all that. ","And that's just a long journey towards acceptance and adoption. Our view is standard of care some day. That's our hope. So we can train them, but the tougher journey there is not a training dynamic, it's acceptance and acceptance of clear line of therapy, the standard and then secondly us getting that chair.","The second one I think, may be where your question was specifically targeted around GP customers and with a 130,000 to 140,000 GPs, we've just trained a slice of them and we have this long journey with them going on, where it usually takes two or three years to, with some exceptions, it takes two or three years to get them to where this is starting to become routinized. Even with the practice that's interested and engaged.","So you know from seeing our utilization, we have this long tail of lower volume practices that are slowly percolating along you know doing their thing. So for practical purposes we could probably, you know we have done some segmentation in the GP base. There's probably a practical number, but even if we wanted to say maybe half of the GPs wouldn't be appropriate for Invisalign in the next five years.","That still leaves us with more than double the install base we've got of users today. And so from our purposes, as we recruit for new doctors, we are really trying to qualify that they really want to bring something different into practice and put effort into it. So could we step on the gas and train 10,000 a year? Sure, I am not sure we get to a better place, but the head room is there to do that.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And then one on your, what you are hearing from the sales force now that we have another quarter under our belts here. Specifically what are you hearing from the sales channel in terms of broader orthodontic patient flow in the US, I mean given your results and what we heard from one of the big diversified players this morning, it sounds like ortho in the quarter very solid, would you take any issue with that, was it solid throughout the quarter and what are you assuming in the third quarter in terms of the sustainability of that strength? Thanks so much.","Tom Prescott","Well sure I mean Danaher Ormco, we think is part of the share leader in North America and worldwide in terms of case starts. So they are probably defining what we probably call the market dynamics in a complete way. I think you have to look, you have to unpack that a bit and success or not success, I guess is probably defined more by products and what\u2019s being used.","So from our perspective, Q2 was a great quarter for us without those. In fact Q2 was a great quarter in virtually every area, we channel every product. So Q3 is typically a strong quarter, but again we are up against these really good competitors like Danaher and Dentsply and 3M and their divisions and they are doing everything they can with their offerings and products to hold traditional or even more modern bracket offerings.","We believe we will continue to be able to wrestle share away from them overtime and we would expect that we will have I think as Ken described in his outlook, we will have a lot of contribution from orthodontists especially in North America in Q3, that\u2019s pretty typical. So I think the offices are pretty active, the summer rush is on, moms and dads are taking kids in when they are out of school and it\u2019s a shopping season for the orthodontic industry at least in North America. So I think all that portends, we have got to go get more than our fair share in Q3 and see what it looks like when we talk in a quarter.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Steve. Operator we will take one last question please.","Operator","Sure. Our next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Tom, could you speak to the demand trend you experienced intra quarter and may be into early 2013 and I am particularly interested in how June may have fared mostly in the US relative to your expectations? And then secondarily to what degree if at all do you perceive the Invisalign product is less sensitive to say the winds of consumer confidence or discretionary spending?","Tom Prescott","If I can take that, I will make the first one easy because we typically don't talk about flow of business. What we do talk about is the things that give rise to flow of business and what I would say is activities in office with our team promotions and programs and consumer, all those demand drivers are running well and we expect to whatever is possible to do as best as possible. Again, so I am not going to comment specifically on the details inside a quarter, the shipments and our performance have to kind of speak for itself and we give a lot of detail about that.","The second part of your question, I completely lost it. I totally apologize. I was doing pretty well till I got there. I will also try to say blithely, I'm not going to answer your question. Please ask your second part again.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Just to what degree, you think the product may be less sensitive to consumer confidence or discretionary spending relative to history?","Tom Prescott","Thanks, you are very gracious. We actually test this a fair amount and we still know that cost is one of the primary reason why a consumer says I am not going to do orthodontic treatment right now. They're rated very highly, but they say not right now. $5000, $6000 to $7000.","We have got a few examples going on to test that a little bit with low end offerings and interestingly we have doctors that are saying with Express 5 for example, they are treating a patient with Express 5. As a result they believe they are going to get the patient back in two or three years for a full treatment, fixing a little bit of crowding or a little spacing has that patient more excited about making this a priority.","And so it's an interesting step one towards comprehensive treatment. The second part of your question is called recession proofing. There is no such thing I think in the real world. I would say that in general, teen and pediatric orthodontics is when it comes time for that; families really try hard to make that fit. We have spoken externally about the size of North America for consumers and we kind of peg that around 23 million to 24 million people in general are interested, available, capable of paying and getting a better smile very high.","If we took, if we go back and look at some testing we did in 2008-2009 in the middle of the meltdown, with consumer confidence being shattered, if we lost half of that potential in terms of willing and able, we still are dramatically under penetrated. So A; orthodontic treatment is under penetrated, B; our product with its value proposition which is a more expansive than orthodontic treatment in general is really under penetrated.","So the best thing we got going for us right now relative to your second question which I completely forgot a minute ago is that under preparation is a wonderful thing. We have got lots of headroom for growth.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Thanks and then Ken, on the cash flow side, were there any one-time items that may explain the year-over-year decline in the operating cash flow and then if you could explain you know just how D&A was down year-over-year; that would be helpful?","Ken Arola","Okay so the cash question. This year, well actually we exited last year and moved into this year, we have actually had some more capital purchases in relation to getting the factory up and running in Juarez and that had some impact to us there and also and things like we benefited related to the tax provisions and stock-based comps, those types of things.","So I think that answers most of that question. The other one on DSOs, DSOs have been pretty consistent at around low 60, 62, 63 days. We don't anticipate that changing a whole lot. You know customers are you know paying us pretty routinely here. You know our terms are 60 days with the doctors in North America, so having DSOs hold in there, we feel pretty good about that.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","You know I meant depreciation and amortization.","Ken Arola","Depreciation and amortization, sorry. So depreciation and amortization will pick up a little bit here. It already has started a little bit and the reason being is we put new equipment into the Juarez facility as bought new facility down in last year, outfitted it and the equipment that we had in and we have been running with for many years is fully depreciated. So you are going to see more depreciation coming from that equipment.","Shirley Stacy","Thank you, operator. That concludes our call. We appreciate your time today.

Tom?","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments: Invisalign Clear Aligner, and Scanner and Services. I'll also provide some color on our customer performance, as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will provide more detail on our financials, discuss our outlook for the first quarter, provide some commentary on our overall business for 2015. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","We are pleased to have delivered a good quarter and finish to the year, driven by continued strong growth in our EMEA and APAC regions, along with solid results in North America.","Q4 revenues of $198.6 million increased 11.4% year-over-year, and Invisalign case volume growth of 14.2%. For the full year, revenues of $761.7 million increased 15.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all customer channels and geographies, as well as expansion of our customer base and increased utilization by existing doctors.","I'm also very pleased to report that shortly after the New Year, we shipped our 3 millionth Invisalign case destined for an Invisalign teen patient in the New Jersey area. This is a significant milestone for Align, for our doctors and for our employees. It took us 10 years to reach our 1 millionth case, another 3 years to the next million and only 2 more years to reach 3 million patients now and counting.","On an overall basis, 2014 was another great year for Align. Our results reflect continued execution of our strategic plan, including our 3 key strategic growth drivers, which are market expansion, product innovation and brand strength.","I'll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. First, market expansion. It comprises the many ways we are working to expand the adult orthodontic treatment category with clear aligner therapy, increase our share of the largest segment of orthodontics, the Teenage market, and open up new and existing markets and geographies around the world.","Over the past year, we have continued to invest in sales coverage, professional marketing and education programs, along with consumer marketing in selected country markets. We've also made targeted investments in opening up new geographic markets. For example, we further expanded our directly covered country markets in Europe by converting 23 countries previously managed by our EMEA distributor back into direct sales geographies.","Today, we are announcing further expansion in the EMEA region with 3 additional European countries, which are Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg or Benelux, which are moving from distributor coverage to our direct sales organization this quarter. As with the previous countries added, we will leverage our existing infrastructure from the adjacent country teams to build local sales coverage, drive long-term market penetration and create a much stronger consumer brand for Invisalign. In the near term, we do not expect the material impact from these new countries, but over the longer term, we believe these smaller individual country markets will support and extend a strong growth in the EMEA region.","In a very important Teen segment, which accounts for approximately 3\/4 of total orthodontic case starts each year, we continue to gain share against traditional brackets and wires. This past year, over 117,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, up 16.1% in an orthodontic market that is growing a low to mid-single digits, overall. While we're pleased with our continued progress, we have yet to realize our full potential in our Teenage segment in North America, not to mention in EMEA or APAC, where we are just getting started. We intend to more -- we intend to achieve more meaningful share gains for Invisalign among teen patients through expanded coverage and support, as well as consumer demand creation programs, to speak directly to teens and their moms to address common misconceptions about Invisalign treatment, letting them know the reality, about how great teen compliance is, the fact that Invisalign costs about the same as braces and the excellent treatment outcomes doctors consistently achieve on teen patients.","The second strategic growth driver, product innovation, aims to create greater doctors preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to increase our doctors' confidence in treating patients with Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. As the science, technology and clinical capability behind Invisalign evolves and expands, our ability to gain incremental share of orthodontic case starts expands with it.","In 2014, we announced multiple innovations designed to improve clinical applicability and predictability of treatment outcomes. In March, we launched Invisalign G5 for deep bite, which includes comprehensive features that make it far easier for our customers to treat this large segment of the market. We estimate that almost half of the orthodontic case starts in North America and Europe and almost 1\/3 of malocclusions that present to doctors in Asia are deep bite cases.","Feedback from doctors on deep bite continues to be positive with some of our most experienced customers calling us a significant enhancement in predictability and sighting increased confidence in Invisalign treatment of deep bite cases. Not only are doctors treating deep bite cases with Invisalign more often compared to previous years, they also report increased confidence using Invisalign on more complex cases over all, and we expect this trend to continue.","In March, we also launched ClinCheck Pro in North America. ClinCheck Pro is the next generation Invisalign treatment software tool. It gives doctors more precise control over the final tooth position to better achieve their treatment goals. ClinCheck Pro will be available in EMEA and APAC this quarter, and we expect to see continued positive effects in treatment outcomes by enabling our doctors to show us rather than just tell us how they want their final set up.","In November, we announced the upcoming release of the Invisalign G6 for treatment of severe crowding and bimaxillary protrusion or first premolar extraction, a common type of malocclusion that affects more than 50% of patients in Asia; along with 20% in Europe; and 12% in North America. We're excited to offer our customers a set of features designed to deliver greater predictability in severe crowding cases that require tooth extraction.","Invisalign G6 clinical innovations will be available in a limited release to Invisalign trained providers in North America during Q1, with broader commercialization efforts in our APAC, EMEA and Latin America geographies throughout 2015. We expect to release Invisalign G6 more widely in North America in early 2016. Given the high relative complexity of cases Invisalign G6 we'll be addressing and a greater time required for treatment in these cases, we expect a gradual adoption much like we are seeing for Invisalign G5, as our doctors try the extraction solution, be comfortable with the increased predictability Invisalign G6 provides and overtime, begin to start more Invisalign cases for this important indication.","Both the Invisalign G5 for deep bite and now Invisalign G6 build on our commitment to systematically address the types of cases our customers are routinely treating in their practices.","Our third strategic growth driver is brand strength, which we use to build category and drive demand. Align is building a superior brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social network and eEvent marketing. Our goals are to make Invisalign a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment.","In North America, we continue to speak directly to adults, moms and teens utilizing combined media programs across TV, social media, PR and digital media. In selected markets across Europe and Asia, we are driving the Invisalign message through social media engagement and PR programs. We are pleased with the progress we're seeing with programs like our EMEA regional city initiative, which has been launched successfully in 10 target cities. In these markets, we have been able to raise awareness of the Invisalign brand and continue to reposition the attractiveness of orthodontic treatment with Invisalign.","There are plenty of highlights to share here, but since we included some details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides, I'll skip those details and let you revisit yourself.","Taken together, these 3 key strategic growth drivers, market expansion, product innovation and brand strength provide us with a set of levers to build the business, giving us confidence in our plans for continued long-term growth.","With these strategic growth drivers in mind, let's talk about how we did in Q4, by sharing some customer and geographic highlights, starting with our fastest-growing business: International.","Q4 was another strong quarter for our international business across the EMEA and APAC regions. On a combined basis, total international Invisalign case volume for Q4 was over 30% of our business for the first time ever, reflecting an increase of 17.1% sequentially and up 29.2% year-over-year. Our strong performance was driven by a combination of increased utilization by orthodontists in all countries, as well as our continued effort to add new Invisalign trained doctors.","On a full year basis, international case shipments increased 28.6%. This progress was driven by a combination of all 3 strategic growth drivers, market expansion as we continue to grow in new markets and achieve better penetration in existing markets through investments and coverage, product innovation as our doctors confidence in clinical results continue to improve from important evolutions in our products, and brand strength as we begin to more effectively reach consumers and help them get the smile they've always wanted.","In the EMEA region, Q4 Invisalign case volume increased 27.5% year-over-year, reflecting record quarter results across all major countries. In the APAC region, Invisalign case volume increased 32.7% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong growth across all countries, with Q4 being a record quarter for Invisalign volume in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.","In China, despite Q4 seasonality due to multiple industry trade shows, conferences and lengthy national holidays across the region, year-over-year growth continues to outstrip the rest of the region and more than doubled again.","The Asia-Pacific region is leading the growth story across the line by execution on the same integrated use of the strategic growth drivers as in EMEA, combined with an extremely strong focus on excellence in clinical education.","We are proud of our teams there and expect this good execution to continue.","For Q4, North America saw solid progress with Invisalign volume up 1.7% sequentially and 8.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q4 growth for North America GP exceeded historical Q4 over Q3 trends, which is offset by an expected slight decline from North American orthos, who typically have slower growth coming off the summer teen season.","On a year-over-year basis, both customer channels were up and growth was driven primarily by continued expansion of our customer base and increased utilization from North American orthos.","Now turning to our Scanner business. Intraoral scanning in general, and with iTero in particular, represents a key future trend in dentistry and a means of connecting all areas of a practice. We are continuing to build a great digital footprint through a growing installed base of iTero scanners. In Q4, our Scanner and Services business revenues were up 3.6 sequentially and up slightly year-over-year.","Our Scanner business continues to benefit from leveraging our combined Invisalign and iTero sales and marketing resources and taking full advantage of Invisalign and industry events. We generated a lot of interest and sales of iTero scanners at the ADA during New York Dental Meetings, as well as our North American Ortho Summit in November.","Our customers have recognized that having an iTero scanner at chair side is a great way to improve the orthodontic experience for their patients and overall practice attractiveness with Invisalign. This underscores the reason why we continue to see substantial growth in utilization among customers with an iTero scanner.","As of Q4, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with the digital scan in North America rose to 37.8% compared to 34% in Q3 and 26.6% in Q4 a year ago.","Overall, the progress we're seeing in North America is encouraging, but does not yet reflect the benefits we expect from optimizing our go-to-market approach and sales force structure, deployment and coverage model, some of which we referenced at our analyst's meeting last May, as well as highlighted briefly in my presentation at J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference a few weeks ago.","More than a year ago, we began a comprehensive assessment of the need for a significant evolution of our strategic and tactical approach in North America business to drive real change and accelerate growth. As a result, we developed and are currently implementing an updated go-to-market strategy with an expanded team and new structure to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage. Our intent is to provide better support and engage with our doctors and their staff members, owning a much bigger place in our doctors practices.","Better understanding of customer insights is essential for improved segmentation of our customer base to ensure more effective sales coverage, delivery of products and services that are tailored to specific needs and targeted selection of practices for recruitment. Our diverse customer base varies widely from the specialist to general dentist, and their needs are quite different from practice to practice. And bringing more analytical rigor to segmentation of our customer base, we are able to derive more holistic effective measures of practice potential rather than simply relying on the current run rate of the business.","Accordingly, we can organize and deploy sales coverage and customer support far more effectively, while reducing sales territory size and significantly increasing the face-time our field team has with these high-value partners.","In order to ensure North America sales and marketing team can increase time in-office and help each practice become more successful, they're in the process of adding a significant headcount to a North America field team that is also evolving a bit in structure. While creating some new roles, the primary changes is an addition of another 50 sales heads, most of which is in place as of today. While smaller in scope than the percentage increases in sales coverage still going on in our APAC region, this infusion of additional talent and expansion of coverage will ensure we can accelerate growth in our North America business.","This approach is similar in some ways to how we restage growth in EMEA and accelerated growth in APAC a few years back. We developed solid plans for each of those regions and invested appropriately in sales coverage, marketing capabilities and acceleration of product development to address more complex cases.","International teams have executed well against our plans, delivering very strong growth that we expect will continue, partly based up on our intent to continue investing into these attractive growth opportunities.","In retrospect, while we were busy increasing investment and building the teams in APAC and EMEA, we under invested in North America business, especially relative to the size of the opportunity. A combination of greater analytical rigor, improved segmentation and a more effective deployment model makes us confident that North America team will also be successful in reaccelerating growth rates.","Additionally, these increased investments in the North America go-to-market strategy and sales force expansion dovetail very well with other key infrastructure projects underway. These projects will ensure expanded capacity to handle additional growth with another manufacturing plant in Juarez, as well as implementation of improved enterprise systems, which will allow for more cost-effective scaling of the business, while enabling better ways of exceeding customer needs.","Combined with new product and technology initiatives, these investments will ensure Align's market leadership for a long time to come.","It's an exciting time to be here at Align. We are accelerating progress in market expansion, product innovation and brand. While we continue to see even more opportunities ahead. We have a robust pipeline of new product initiatives and a long list of high NPV projects in virtually every area of the company. Even with all of that, we still see significant potential to further leverage our unique core competencies, which include digital treatment planning at significant scale, the ability to create software and algorithms clinically informed by more than 5 million Invisalign iTero cases and computerizing precision control manufacturing for customized appliances.","For some time, we've been considering a few opportunities adjacent to orthodontics and restorative dentistry, which could potentially leverage the core competencies that I just mentioned. One of those is a large market for a serious and growing medical condition, obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. Increasingly, dentists are becoming involved in the treatment of, and management of patients with mild to moderate OSA conditions, principally through the use of devices called mandibular advancement or mandibular repositioning devices. We believe our core competencies line up very well with this therapeutic approach and have been working with several players in the dental treatment of OSA. While still a bit in stealth mode, we are now ready to share a little more about our plans, including a relationship with an innovator in the OSA market that is working with us to develop new products for dentists to treat mild to moderate OSA, with Oral Appliance Therapy.","This investment, in addition to other potential high-impact projects, fits extremely well within our overall strategy and can form the base for a new set of OSA therapeutic offerings at Align. These new products will benefit from continued evolution in our world class manufacturing technology base and over time, help make us far more relevant to our dental customers as they begin to treat a wider definition of oral health. We are very interested in this new adjacent market opportunity and the potential for commercial entry in the next year or so.","As I said a moment ago, these are exciting times at Align. We're in a period of substantial investment in a series of initiatives that give us even greater confidence we can accelerate top line growth, generate incremental operating income, and extend our market leadership in clear aligner therapy and digital restorative dentistry.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q4 financial results. David?","David L. White","Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all of the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. With that, let's review our Fourth Quarter and Full Year financial results.","Revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $198.6 million, up 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 11.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $186.4 million was up 4.7% sequentially and up 12.2% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth reflected strong volume from our international doctors, offset somewhat by a decrease in ASPs. Q4 ASPs were down sequentially $22, of which approximately $18 or $2.3 million in aggregate, was primarily related to the weakening euro.","Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, offset by lower ASPs, again, primarily related to foreign exchange rates and higher discounts.","For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 126,900 cases were up 6.1% sequentially, reflecting continued strong international growth, which was up 17.1% sequentially, whereas North America was only up slightly.","Year-over-year, case volume growth was 14.2% reflected in increased utilization, primarily from North America orthodontic customers, as well as expansion of both our North American GP customer base and international doctors.","North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 1% sequentially and up 12.6% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentist, case volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 4.1% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume increased 17.1% sequentially and 29.2% year-over-year. Worldwide, Invisalign utilization in Q4 was 4.4 cases per doctor, unchanged from 4.4 in Q4 2013. North American, ortho utilization of 8.6, increased from 8.0 in the prior year. North America GP utilization of 2.9 was slightly down from 3.0 of the prior year. In international, doctor utilization of 4.5 was essentially flat with the prior year.","In Q4, we added 1,170 new North American doctors and 1,255 new international doctors. In total, we added 2,425 new Invisalign doctors in Q4.","Fourth quarter revenue of our Scanner and Services segment was $12.2 million, a 3.6% increase sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our Scanner and Services revenue was slightly higher by 0.8%.","Moving onto gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, down sequentially 0.5 points and 0.6. year-over-year, primarily as a result of the impact of FX on ASPs. Recall that the prior years, fourth quarter gross margins also benefited from onetime items, of which, warranty costs were one, that amounted to approximately 1.5 points.","Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 78.8%, down 0.4 point sequentially and 1 point year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year decreases were primarily the result of lower ASPs, substantially attributable to a weaker euro and onetime benefit as previously discussed. Q4 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 30.2%, down 3.3 points sequentially and 0.9 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the results of higher product costs, and to a lesser extent, lower ASPs due to year-end promotions.","Year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs, due to higher promotional programs, partially offset by more favorable product mix. Prior year results were unfavorably impacted by the sale of older, end-of-life products.","Q4 operating expenses were $99.2 million. This represented a sequential increase of $6 million, due primarily to higher sales and marketing spend, attributable to key customer events, legal and related expenses, and to a lesser extent our first investment in the obstructive sleep apnea market.","On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating expenses were up $16 million, reflecting continued investment in new and existing markets and geographies, as well as new products and technology.","Our fourth quarter operating margin was 25.9%, down 1.2 points sequentially and 3.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was principally related to higher operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, lower gross margins as just described. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin reflects higher operating expenses. And as previously mentioned, the prior year's operating margin included onetime gross margin benefits, as well as approximately a $2.5 million benefit for stock compensation expense as a result of executive departures. These results increased last year's operating margin by 3 points.","Other income and expense included $2 million of charges, or approximately $0.02 per share, primarily related to FX losses due to the weakening of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Further, the quarter-over-quarter impact of currency on revenue, net of the benefit we get on the translation of expenses at a lower rate was $0.01 per share.","With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 20.6%. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.48 compared to $0.47 reported in Q3 and $0.51 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $129.8 million, down approximately 0.2% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 58 days, down 4 days sequentially and up 1 day over the same period a year ago.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $7.1 million, primarily relating to manufacturing capacity additions. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $69.4 million. And free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $62.3 million.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $602.6 million. This compares to $472 million at the end of 2013, an increase of approximately $131 million. The company repurchased approximately 470 -- 417,000 shares of stock for $20.8 million during the quarter. These repurchases were part of the 3-year $300 million stock repurchase program we announced on April 23, 2014.","Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I'd like to make a few comments on our full year 2014 results. Revenue was a record $761.7 million, up 15.4% year-over-year. In 2014, we shipped 478,000 Invisalign cases, up 13.2% and reflecting 28.6% volume growth from our international doctors.","Full year operating income was $193.6 million, or 25.4% of revenue. While this was better than the 2014 outlook we described at the beginning of the year, more importantly, it marked the first-time our operating margin has been within the range of our long-term financial model target for the full year, albeit at the low end of that range.","We generated $224.7 million of cash flow from operations in 2014 and had free cash flow of $200.6 million. In addition, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $98.2 million. 2014 diluted EPS was $1.77.","With that, let's now turn our attention to the outlook for Q1 and provide some commentary on 2015. Part of doing so, however, I'd like to start by reviewing the framework under which we operate and drive the business. We've consistently talked about 3 pillars of investments, that together work in tandem to drive top line growth and deliver bottom line results. Tom talked about them in his remarks. Market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. At the start of 2014, our plans anticipated significant incremental investments in new programs, most of which focused on market expansion and product innovation. We largely executed on that plan as evidenced by the exceptional 2014 growth of our international business and the release of various new product offerings, which Tom mentioned. It was the largest year-over-year incremental investment in new programs we'd ever made.","As Tom just described, our plans for 2015 are no less ambitious. This year, we expect to invest substantially more year-over-year in more programs. While much of that will again focus on growth drivers, particularly market expansion, there will be some new areas of concentrated focus, like obstructive sleep apnea and enterprise systems.","Together, we believe these investments will position us to increase our top line growth, deliver earnings leverage and produce operating results that will further penetrate our long-term operating model range, as we demonstrated in 2014 with outstanding International growth and operating margin performance. We're already executing on many of these investments, recognizing that there'll be some lag between investment and returns. Consequently, our outlook reflects that impact.","With that backdrop, let's now turn to our business outlook for the first quarter and the factors that inform our view.","Starting with the demand outlook. Consistent with historical trends, we expect demand in North America to be up slightly in Q1, driven primarily by demand from orthodontists.","Turning to our international business, our first quarter has historically been a slower period for doctors and fewer days in the office due to the winter holidays in Europe and the Lunar New Year in Asia, so while we expect continued double digit growth year-over-year, we expect International volume to be down slightly on a sequential basis.","As for our Scanner business, Q1 has historically been a slower period for equipment sales, following strong tax incentives driven demand at year end, and accordingly, we expect this segment to be down in Q1.","We expect gross margin to be slightly down in Q1, primarily as a result of foreign exchange, additional aligners per case as we treat more complex cases, as well as increased manufacturing costs, that I'll talk about momentarily as a part of OpEx.","Operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter, consistent with historical first quarters, based on several factors. First of all, employee compensation-related costs will increase in Q1 for 2 reasons. As a company, we operate on an annual cycle for all worldwide employee compensation reviews, including salary increases and promotions, as well as annual stock grants. These increases are effective in the first quarter. Further, employer paid payroll taxes, such as social security taxes in the U.S., reset at the start of the new calendar year.","Second, incremental investments in market expansion, particularly North America, but also internationally, will increase operating expenses as we add additional coverage resources.","And finally, investments outside of our historical core business, like obstructive sleep apnea and enterprise systems will also be incremental to our baseline spending coming out of Q4.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 124,400 to 127,400 cases, flat to a slight decrease from Q4. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $187.3 million to $192.4 million, a sequential decrease from Q4, primarily as result of lower ASPs driven by a weaker euro.","We expect gross margin to be in the range of 73.5% to 74%, down sequentially from Q4 as mentioned above. We expect the operating expenses to be in the range of $105.2 million to $106.5 million. The sequential increase from Q4 also reflecting the aforementioned investments.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 17.4% to 18.6%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23%, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $82.1 million, excluding repurchases as mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.32. And based on today's exchange rates, Q1 earnings would be impacted by about $0.04.","With that, let me now provide some additional comments with respect to 2015.","We believe our investment plans will continue to drive long-term sustainable growth that will far outpace the industry and further perpetuate our market share gains. While 2014 marked the first time we delivered full year operating margin results, within our long-term model, albeit at the low end of that range. FX and our new investment will make that more challenging in 2015. While we haven't had a practice of providing full year guidance, let me see if I can put these into context with respect to our actual 2014 results and our long-term model.","First of all, from a revenue standpoint, we see year-over-year growth in both Invisalign case demand and revenue, when measured on a constant currency basis, to be in the high teens and within our long-term operating model. Based on today's exchange rates, however, the euro has fallen approximately 16% from the 2014 average. As a result, 2015 revenue growth will face headwinds in the range of 6 to 7 points. If this rate prevails through the year, this will put our growth somewhere in the low double-digit range and below the bottom end of our long-term model.","From an operating margin standpoint, if we exclude investment and obstructive sleep apnea, which is outside of our core business, and investment in enterprise systems, which will have a limited duration, we believe 2015 operating margins, at constant currency, would be very consistent with our 2014 results and would again fall within our long-term model. To be clear, this does include all of the other incremental investments for market expansion and product technology that Tom referred to in his remarks.","Including these 2 investments, along with the weaker euro, however, will impact 2015 operating margins on the order of 4 to 5 points. This figure is net of the benefit we realized from lower OpEx as a result of the weaker euro. All said, this would place us below the low-end of our operating model.","We believe these investments present high-quality opportunities important for driving customer adoption, accelerating our growth in North America, continuing to expand and grow internationally and together, building a foundation for long-term sustainable growth. While many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful returns, others should begin showing returns in the second half of 2015. Hence, we see our earnings fall [ph] in the second half of the year as stronger than the front half of the year.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments.","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, David. On an overall basis, 2014 was a year of solid financial results and excellent strategic progress. Our teams continue to deliver in virtually every area and a few where we're not satisfied, like our North America business, we are taking important steps to accelerate growth to become even more relevant to our customers. We believe the evolution in the go-to-market strategy for the North American business, including the strategic deployment of more optimal coverage and the right technology tools and support for our combined marketing and sales teams is the right thing to do. I'm confident these investments will deliver a great return for our customers, our shareholders and our employees, and result in getting Align back to the midrange of our long-term target growth rate.","Given the number of attractive investments to grow the top line, drive improved customer outcomes and satisfaction, and better profitability, we are making the choice to manage the business carefully through this cycle of heavier investment, with the commitment to restage growth towards that middle of our long-term model range and deliver improved operating margins. The entire Align team is committed to making this happen. I'm extremely excited about our progress, and I look forward to discussing this with many of you as we get out to dental trade shows and investor events over the next few months.","And with that, we will move to take some questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And I do see the first question is coming from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I've got a handful, but I'll try to keep it to 2 and then I'll try to follow-up with you guys off line. I think I'll keep it big picture, Tom, I'm looking at 3- to 5-year models that say, Op [ph] margins of 25% to 30%. And it looks like because of the investment in OSA, you're thinking about going down in the near-term and some currency, but maybe down to around 20% or 21%. How quickly are these accretive? I mean, I'm just trying to think of if you were to even get to 25% Op [ph] margin in 3 or 4 years, your leverage would have to go something like 20%, 24%, 26%, 29%, to even get to the bottom end of the range. So can you just help us with your confidence that you can get to 25% plus Op margins in 3 to 5? And why you think they're going to be that accretive that quickly? That's the first question.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. Thanks -- or maybe 1a. I'll start and then ask David to come in behind me. The biggest thing here is FX as everybody adjusts to it. We've got plenty of company. That's the biggest single move pushing us down. Secondly, we have some transitory investments like initiation into sleep apnea that is more development-focused that is a little bit of a deferral for revenues streams, and I'd say that I think within the next year or so, we'll have at least some initial commercialization. From that point on, it should start to be closer to accretive. Third, we've got investments in the factory and some other places in infrastructure that are kind of period investments and then amortized over time, so it's a little lumpy here. If I come back to maybe the most predictable returns, they are on the go-to-market side. And with some exhibits we put out, some slides, I think we tried to -- given the size of the investments and the intensity of what we're trying to do, we want our owners to understand where that money was going as we provide a lot of information this quarter. If we look at what's going on in Asia, in EMEA and what we believe will play out now in North America, we believe those will start to return within 2 or 3 quarters, increments of coverage, doing better things in the right places, better programs for customer and all that. So if I started to go to market side, reasonably good track record there of demonstrating. And even in North America where we haven't been where we wanted to, we have delivered incremental results in the back half of the year, virtually every year, where we put incremental results in, maybe, in Q4, Q1. We expect that to accelerate a bit more with a bigger investment and going about it in a different way than we have done for years. Peeling that down to product and those -- well, we've got a series of new product releases coming out that we expect will have impact. And again, our cadence is invest in coverage, support, marketing programs and consumer earlier on in the year. Bring product releases right in behind them and then build that through the year. And virtually, every year -- I think David talked about more normalizing for FX and a few other things that are different this year, we've been able to show that operating leverage in the model every single year. 2014 was a great example. We wound up, speaking about some bigger investments, especially outside the U.S -- we grew into that as the year progressed -- we had a good operating margin at year-end, and for the first time, lived with a net model for the full year, so confident, comfortable. FX is a bit of a wildcard for everybody. We're not apologizing, but we're trying to be very clear about the relative impact, and I'll let David pile on a few things if I missed anything.","David L. White","Yes, I guess I would -- I'm not sure there's much to add there, actually, Jon. But we -- as we said in our remarks, if you look at 2014, we delivered within the operating model, and we continue to believe -- holding aside FX, our business will continue to grow year-over-year within that operating model, and so that's an incremental leverage that we should get off of the growth we expect to see this year with under almost all other circumstances fully cover the incremental investments we're making this year. The only carve-out we made was those 2 carve-outs: one for OSA, which is outside our core business; and then the other, which was enterprise computing, which is -- or enterprise systems, which is certainly inside our core business but is more of a limited duration in terms of how long that investment would be ongoing, more on the order a year or a year-plus, and so we feel like we're already getting leverage off of the scale as the business grows from the fact we believe we can absorb all those investments with those 2 carve outs only, so...","Thomas M. Prescott","FX aside, yes.","David L. White","Yes, FX certainly aside.","Thomas M. Prescott","Let's go to 1b.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, and then I guess 1b, and again, I'll follow-up with you guys on some more. But just, Tom, you didn't discuss your exact plans long-term with OSA and selling. But why now? I mean, you've been slugging it out and trying to reaccelerate growth here in North America, and I think it's been, in your words, a little bit tougher than maybe you had assumed 12 months ago. Why deter management focus, sales focus by going after OSA now instead of continuing to try to reaccelerate growth in a market where you, say, 25 million to 30 million people are looking for a solution to straighten their teeth?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. They're not mutually exclusive. These are different resources going to development cycles and upstream marketing, not -- and clinical development, clinical trial, et cetera -- not to sales, downstream marketing, anything. Secondly, as we dig a lot deeper into North America GP, and we really come back, and one of our clinical objectives for a long time, has been how do we become even more relevant with our average customer doing 10 cases a year doing against 3,000 dental procedures they do a year or more in a bigger office. So increasingly, they're interested by, and working with, new opportunities as patients think about expanding how oral health fits with their dentists and with physical health, and this is a very fast growing area, and we think it's an opportunity that directly leverages our strength. The other part of this is, globally, we probably now, I believe, have the largest specialty sales force in the world. And the reality is here that we're going to have an opportunity over time to put more high-value products into that team, covering the right GPs, doing the right things. That's not today. There's 0 distraction for this team. They're off and running, but over time, we'll have an opportunity to add more to the basket. In an area that is not a bolt-on just to have something, it's an area where we think we'd add real value to and can leverage our core competencies to the better, so there's never a perfect time. We have said for a long time that we don't have the money burning our hole in our pocket. It's more that can we find opportunities that fit our strategic direction that would leverage our core competencies and would extend our ability to add value to customers, and in this case, it's all 3. So that's why now, and obviously, FX is a lousy time for everybody, but we're not apologizing or complaining. We do believe these are the right investments to push through for the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the stats you gave. I think if I heard you correctly, you seem to suggest that the euro -- the exchange rate has fallen 16% from the average level in 2014? And you thought that, that would impact your revenue run rate by 6% to 7% and your operating margin by 4 to 5 points? Did I hear that correctly, number one?","David L. White","Pretty close. All except for the last part of the 4 to 5 points. The 4 to 5 points included not only the impact of foreign exchange rates but also included the 2 investments that I talked about earlier, which was OSA and enterprise systems, so that's also in that 4% to 5% bucket.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And if I look at your Q1 ASP levels, I think your revenues and K shipments kind of implying something in the low 1,300. This -- it seems to be down about 6% year-over-year and maybe down about $50 on a sequential basis. You did a good job in sort of quantifying how much of that was FX this quarter. How much of that do you think is FX-driven next quarter, because I'm trying to assess whether there's any sort of mix and -- or mix changes in that number?","David L. White","Well, I have no idea what foreign currency rates are going to be for second quarter, so...","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm guessing you're making some assumption, right, when you're kind of giving these revenue numbers, right? So I'm kind of curious about maybe what -- I'm trying to back in to maybe what you're assuming from a currency perspective in this quarter.","David L. White","Yes, fair enough. Fair enough. So right now, the best indication we have for currency rates for 2015 are the current rates that prevail today. We're not in the habit or we're not experts on projecting foreign exchange rates, and I would guess there's probably any one that is, so all of the assumptions we talked about for 2015 assume that the rates that prevail today prevail throughout the entire year. And so to the extent those rates change in either direction, that will have some bearing on how 2015 ultimately shapes up as we talked about here.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's perfect. Tom, maybe can I just squeeze one more in on some of these investments you're making in North America? Could you give us a sense for how many bodies you have on the ground right now? How many you think you need to hire? Because I think we're all trying to assess what -- how much of these -- or how big the incremental investments are going to be and then how we should think about them as a percentage of ongoing cost versus maybe onetime in nature, and then I'll hop off.","Thomas M. Prescott","I'll answer the question consistently with what we've previously discussed. Given that we're going to continue investing the growth in market expansion, which is a fairly reasonably predictable lever for us, you should expect us to invest into each of our geographies each year to a greater or lesser extent. Over the past few years in North America, even with some meaningful bodies on a percentage basis, it was less and less as we were really throwing more percentage increases into EMEA and APAC. Secondly, I think when I talked about -- in addition to just getting behind the curve a little bit in North America, our game didn't evolve as well as it should have in terms of what we were doing, who we were doing it with and how effective we could measure and deliver. And so over the last year or 2, we've been looking at overhauling a lot of that. So besides just headcount, there are a lot of positive changes about how we're doing it. With that said, we threw a slide in there somewhere. I don't have a number, but it's -- we basically showed in North America, EMEA and APAC with a bar at the left. I'm not going to give you absolute numbers, you can get yourself pretty close, showing what our total headcount is and then also showing what our incremental increases are over prior -- over 14 in each of those geographies, so we give you most of what you need there. This is a bigger number of heads in North America, and at a fully-loaded cost, a little bigger of a load, but it's not as big as a percentage increase, which is more than doubling what's going on in, say, APAC, so I -- we tried to size that. I knew you'd ask that question. The second part of your question is, \"Do I need to pop this into my model each year?\" The answer is probably not. We're going to be tighter on our North America business in terms of managing that, our approach, and tweaking that model. As I said, we've said for a couple of quarters, we've not been satisfied with the progression of that business, the team's on it. We believe this is moving in the right direction. We believe this puts us in the right range. That said, we trained over 4,000 doctors in North America last year, and we got to the point where territory sizes were just increasing to be too big. And when we went out and sat down with a lot of our customers, doing a lot of very detailed work, consistent input from customers that really wanted to elevate their practice, they couldn't get enough face-time with a rep. They didn't have enough time to work on the tools and routinize procedures. Our goal is to get a number of accounts down per territory, substantially, and then manage that in a relative way over time, so this is a bit of a surge this year in North America, continuing significant investment in APAC and EMEA where we're seeing the growth, and our belief is we can restage growth in North America, but don't expect you'd have to see this kind of a lump every year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Actually, Tom, can you just expand on what you were just saying? If you think about, specifically, your North American GP business where growth has slowed a bit, can you just talk a bit more about what your strategy is to reinvigorate that? It seems like that's a customer base that's going to be a bit more fragmented, probably lower volume ortho customers in general. Do you think you can really reach them efficiently with a direct sales model?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure, the answer is yes, John. It's hard, but it's worth doing, and there's 2 or 3 things that intersect here for us. The first here are the 20-plus thousand active GP customers in North America. There are quite a few that would like to do more. Whether they're 10 and they want to go to 30, whether they're 30 and they want to go 50 or whether they're 5, they just got trained but they're really ready to go. We have been -- we found it very, very difficult over the last year, 1.5 year to cover all of them, and we've got some great success stories where we were able to work with the practice the right way and they've really built a terrific business, delivering great customer results, patient results, et cetera, but that's -- not enough of those. Part of this is a very detailed segmentation that we can help our reps, our region managers, our teams recruit better, the practices that are -- that really do want in that really are -- the wrong word is fit but I'll use it for the moment. And then also, the customer base we've got work with those customers that really want to elevate their game, that really want to make Invisalign and some straightforward ortho a part of their practice to fit in with their restorative. And there's thousands of such customers who want more access, time and energy from us and are more than willing to partner. We know who they are by address, by name. Many of them have declared so, and so our job is to give them the right coverage, the right tools and support to make that happen, and so we're not going to move the whole -- the needle on the whole base. Fragment is exactly the right word, John. You're a good observer of the dental market, and we're going to move the needle on those practices that can and will. The second intersection here is scanners. As we continue to evolve the Scanner business and grow our installed base and over time work with other partners, that will help make that Invisalign experience plus other products we have work better. And then third, new offerings over time, like very high value oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, which is more and more top-of-mind for some doctors. If it's easy to do, which today is not, generally, hard on the patient, hard on the doctor, a lot of visits, our view would be that ought to be able to be simplified, customized dramatically. And that, again, increases our relevance with those practices. It gives us an opportunity to earn more share of mind and share of practice. So collectively, it's a bit of a long journey within the GP side, but as I said before, it is very much worth doing strategically.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. Just one quick follow-up, David, for you. The 4 to 5 points that you'd sort of signaled that EBIT margin could be down in '15. Would you be willing to break that into how much is FX-driven given current rates versus how much are coming from some of these new investment areas?","David L. White","Yes, roughly 2\/3 of it is FX and then the balance is the 2 investments we talked about.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just focus on the -- those 2 incremental projects here that we're talking about. On the ERP side, I still consider you guys a fairly young company, you're not a serial acquirer. What's wrong with ERP systems now? Or why do you need a new ERP system, especially in a period where maybe you're investing heavily in the sales force? Currency is going to hit margins and things like that. I mean, why now on ERP?","David L. White","Yes, Jeff, this is David. So first of all, the company -- every year, as we go through our strategic planning process and annual operating plan and so forth, we review long list of projects that are worthy of investing in and helping focus on to grow the business, et cetera, and ERP's actually been on that list for a long time. But when you look at the ROI we've been able to get out of product innovation and ROI out of market expansion and so forth, it has just never gotten to a point where it's raised itself to a hurdle rate that made it -- make the cut, you might say. But as we've grown and as our businesses have gotten more complex, it's become more clear to us that we have opportunities to streamline our business, to become more agile, to service our customers better, and one of the things that we believe is standing in the way of that is having a unified platform as a company under which we can present our business to the doctor, under which we can execute the workings of the company. And so it's gotten to that point where it's made the cut, and so we're biting the bullet to make it happen, and we think it's going to be something that ultimately will give us not only better agility but better scaling ability. But perhaps even more importantly, it's going to give us some capabilities with our doctors that today we presently don't have or can't fully take advantage of.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. And you think those are about 1 year of investment, David?","David L. White","Yes, 1, 1-plus typically is the horizon.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is just on the sleep apnea. As I think about that treatment area in dentistry, most of the companies I'm talking to in that area look at full airway analysis that needs a larger imaging device, whether it's 3D imaging or something like that as opposed to just your scanner technology. So what I'm trying to figure out what your competitive advantage might be. And two, when I think about that competitive advantage, typically, I believe it's just you order a mouthpiece. And then while you guys are good at maybe 3D printing that mouthpiece or generating that mouthpiece with your manufacturing technology, again, I think of your core competencies in kind of high throughput multi-aligner manufacturing, not manufacturing a single mouthpiece for patients. But I'm just trying to figure out why you guys might be the company to do sleep apnea as opposed to a company that has bigger imaging technologies or isn't -- doesn't have your core competencies that seem stronger to me elsewhere.","Thomas M. Prescott","That's a very fair question, and what I'd say is that we don't expect to replace all the other players. Oral appliance therapy is -- today is still a very small part of a pretty big market, and it's a profoundly tough disease for people that have it. And for people that have OSA, having BiPAP or CPAP therapy is the standard of care. We don't expect that changes anytime soon. But a, there are people that are refractive to that treatment, just do not want to do it; or b, they are very mild to moderate, and this is a rapidly growing area. The second part of this is if you look at the intersection of treatment planning and algorithms to be very predictive, today, the titration process for figuring out how much advancement is necessary to keep that airway open, how comfortable that is for the patient, how many visits to the dentist office and the patient have to have, it's just -- it's very difficult. We believe there are opportunities that dramatically streamline that, building on all the diagnostic data that's out there, from the sleep doctor to lab and perhaps an MD, who's also in the loop. But dentists are in this business. They're increasingly -- and they're the right ones to think about how much mandibular advancement can you do without impacting TMG [ph] or anything else, so our job is to help them with clinical algorithms that make sense. And whether we're making -- we make part numbers of one. Every part number that goes through our factory is a part of one. It's not a series, and whether that's part of a case or one broke along the way, we can have a part of one go catch up with that case further on in the process, so this is about mass customization, very, very precise computer-controlled treatment planning and clinical algorithms. And I think, again, I'm not going to go any further, this is complementary with what other people are doing, but we believe better, cheaper, faster and far more effective.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can we just simplify the discussion around ASPs? The comment, David, that you made was you were looking for revenues and volumes both in the high-teens, excluding currency. Is that right? And does that imply that ASPs are flat ex currency?","David L. White","So number one, currencies don't affect volumes. We think volume growth like -- will be within our long-term model, number one. Currencies does affect revenue, but if we neutralize that effect and we just simply look at constant currency, if the current -- the exchange rates in 2015 were roughly equivalent to 2014, our revenue, we believe, would grow within our long-term model and be relatively consistent with what we delivered in 2014.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the commentary around the addition of manufacturing capacity in Juarez, could you give us a sense of what the impact is on the P&L from that capacity expansion just in terms of incremental spend?","David L. White","It's relatively small this quarter. We're in the process -- I think we've talked previously about -- at some point, we would need to add additional brick-and-mortar in addition to just simply buying additional pieces of capital equipment that actually operate in the factory. Well, we've gotten to that point. That factory will come online sometime later this year, and we will expect to bring up that capacity gradually over time as it's called upon, and so we'll try to make sure that the -- make sure those capital additions of equipment, so forth, are staged, commensurate with how our business is growing. As it relates to the impact for the year, I think there's a modest impact, a little bit, on gross margin for the year, particularly the second half of the year. But as I gave guidance for 2015, we've ultimately believed that our revenue growth and everything else, holding currency aside, would absorb that and still deliver our business within our long-term model, including gross margins.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then -- and Tom, you made mentioned again the possibility of working with additional partners in intra-oral scanning. Any updated thoughts on the right time lines for that kind of move?","Thomas M. Prescott","Just that it continues to be significant activity for the enterprise. We've indicated as clearly as we could that this is strategically valuable for the enterprise to do, and that you ought to assume we're out working with logical players that have interest in the same. This is one of these where until it's ready, we don't want to talk about it, and that's about as far as I'd like to go.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, you mentioned hurdle rates in deciding on some of these investments. Any more you can share on how you decided whether these investments were the best return on capital? I'm curious just as far as the decision-making process and how you contemplated the timing of doing all these investments at the same time if we're thinking about the sales force investment, ERP, sleep apnea, et cetera.","David L. White","Well, first of all, when we -- we have an ongoing process for evaluating projects that are currently underway as well as -- and early in the funnel in terms of our execution on them as well as projects there at the top of the funnel or just kind of circulating around in the way of ideas. Somewhere between those 2 points, a business case gets put together, a feasibility analysis gets put together. And as those things come together, we're presented with an opportunity to decide whether or not we've got capacity to add resources to it and pursue that project or not, whether or not we can constrain it within our operating plan or not, et cetera, and so I wouldn't say there's a single litmus test that we applied to all these because there are certain -- many of these projects have intangibles associated with them that are not easily measured in a highly quantifiable way, but as we look at those intangibles and we look at the tangible things that we can measure and we look at how they'll -- our available resources and we look at how it fits in our envelope and so forth, those things all come together to make, you might say, an informed decision. Now as we go through our strategic plan, our annual operating plan process, there's a process we go through that based on that criteria, we begin winnowing some of that down. And as it related to the projects that we're looking at doing for 2015, we felt like we had a significant number of projects that had high return opportunities on them. We felt that we could basically fit them, you might say, within our operating model as our business grew and so forth, and we decided to execute on those, and we approved them, and we're staffing for them accordingly. The only 2 that I carved out were OSA, which is outside of our core business but yet we feel, over a longer term, is a little bit longer horizon, is going to be accretive as well; and then, as we talked -- as I mentioned in the prior question, enterprise systems as well at the same time.","Thomas M. Prescott","Hey, Bob, if I could pile on just for a second. In addition to a standalone business case or investment choice, there is significant interdependence between some of these investments. There are things we want to do as a company. I spoke briefly at the recent conference about this thing we're calling our little, in a small way, not grand, digital ecosystem, and that's a way of surrounding customers in a very different way with our scanner and others bringing in much higher value set of work streams and new applications; physical and digital. And in that direction, becoming a heck of a lot more relevant. This is where you start getting to adjacent therapeutic opportunities that would trade well on our core competencies like sleep apnea, and it became very compelling. And now then you come back to ERP, and if ERP can enable acceleration in some of these things, the payback for an ERP project, we might have waited a year or 2, starts looking more attractive because it enables acceleration in other areas. And then finally, you come back to number one, we were -- I will speak critically of ourselves here. In the last couple of quarters, we've not been satisfied with the deceleration in growth rate in North America, especially in the GP side, and we're bound and determined to fix it. So as we look at that, and we look at what we could put into that team with evolving products we haven't spoken about yet, with other things in the pipeline, we want to get a team in place, surround the customer properly with a whole lot of new capability and then we can really start to leverage the top line for whole streams of other kinds of revenue as we're looking out here. Again, we're trying to make the organic machine even better, and so there is significant interdependence. These aren't always so easily standalone.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. And I guess just the related question to that would be around other uses of cash, and you guys had, had a 3-year repo program out there. I'm just curious as, I guess, twofold as you evaluated these investments on a return basis, how did they stack up relative to just a larger buyback? And then any update on how we should think about the repo in light of these investments would be helpful.","Thomas M. Prescott","I'll start and let David answer your direct question. The simple fact is everything we're talking about has high NPV. We're trying to be very good stewards here, and yet we see this opportunity to accelerate impact and progress in the business, certainly to the midterm. We believe we can restage growth more closer to the middle of our range where it had been hanging around the low end, and let's put FX aside just a moment. We look at all that first and then we would come back and evaluate our capital allocation strategy in the context of our long-term strategy and then have thoughtful discussions with our Board about it. I'll let David comment specifically on our progress on the buyback and how we go from here.","David L. White","Yes, I guess I would add one thing to it and that is as we think about our investments each -- almost each and every day around here, most of them are P&L investments. They're not significant capital investments on the balance sheet like plant and equipment. Certainly, we talked a little bit about that on the call today about adding capacity on the manufacturing side and so forth, but when you look holistically across all the investments we make, most of them are P&L-related, and so we do feel some -- there is a balance between how much we put into the P&L, how long it's going to take for us to recognize returns from that because as we grow top line, as we grow leverage with scale and so forth, that brings more to the bottom line that either gets flows into cash and ultimately back to the shareholders through repurchases or flows into new opportunities for us to invest -- reinvest back into the business, and so that's kind of the way we look at it, and when we -- last spring, when we had our, I think, our Q1 call and we talked about a definitive program for stock repurchases is in light of those trade-offs. And at that point in time, as we looked at our long-term model and our long-term cash-generating capability, we recognized that those P&L investment opportunities are only going to take -- are going to -- only require some percentage of our cash flow generation over that time period. And that excess, above and beyond what we thought those needs would be, either for those projects or, strategically, for longer-term things, we should be able to return to shareholders. And that's how we came up with number one, the $300 million stock repurchase plan, number one. And number two, it's also what informed us as we expanded our business models to include free cash flow generation. And it's that free cash flow generation that the excess of which we would expect which we would expect to use for stock repurchases. So you should expect that sometime over this year, we'll commence repurchasing the second $100 million out of that $300 million, and I think you should also expect that in line with that long-term cash flow model we're talking about, at some point, we'll revaluate that. We just haven't gotten to that point where it make sense to do that, but that's certainly how we would see it playing out.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis with Roth Capital Partners.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Tom, I guess, I was hoping you could elaborate just on the revamped go-to-market approach in North America, specifically beyond just adding the 50 heads. Can you elaborate on the types of changes that are being made within the actual structure of the sales organization there whether it's changing the territory size or level of support service or the compensation structure?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes to all of the above and more. I mean, it starts, Chris, with making sure you've got the right people in the field and then doing the right things and, importantly, at the right customers. We've thrown a lot of heads out in the field over the last 3 to 5 years, and we've trained a lot of doctors. And I'm overstating for affect, but in some cases, we left the region managers and the reps to figure out who to call on. And while we tried to drive a more systematic, I'll call it, scripted approach, we were only partially successful with that. The evolving go-to-market game plan is a bigger team, organized a bit differently, smaller regions, more line of sight, expecting longer calls in the office more, fewer customers and calling on the customers that are -- that fit, that are committed, that really want to elevate and spend more time, not as -- an earlier question said they're fragmented, not every dentist even wants to do ortho, and so -- and by the way, along the way, we're finding ways we can support low-volume customers that are very valuable to us, but really don't want to put more time and energy now. 15 cases a year is just fine for them, and we'll find ways to support them. We are struggling to do that. One of these evolutions is we're finding a support model that can do that. The important thing is here is we're already getting some very good feedback. This actually started fairly early in Q4 in a small way, and we pretty much had everybody on board before the end of the year. So as we did kick off meetings. We typically do that each year all around the geographies. Everybody's up and running, and they're on the same page. Finally, we've got better tools. I mean, it seems basic, but the right people in the right account doing the right things in a very systematic way and then measuring progress literally day-by-day, account-by-account. So far more prescriptive about our approach, far more consistent about how we block and tackle, very specific learning from segmentation about where we're spending our time and energy and then finding more cost-effective ways to support lower volume customers that today don't want to do more, but they're still very valuable to us, and they're great customers, and someday, they may. And then behind all of that, our goal is to build a bigger installed base of scanners, ours and others, and leverage those with more applications, like the outcome simulator for Invisalign and clinical applications at chair-side. It should make everything easier for that doctor. So that's -- I called it earlier days there, but the team is managing through the churn very well so far, and they're off and running. So a lot of changes, as I said, comp, structure, et cetera.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Great. I appreciate the color there. And then David, maybe a question for you on ASPs, maybe 2 parts first. Are there any other levers beyond FX that's driving the implied sequential decrease from the fourth quarter to the first quarter internationally? And then secondly, how should we think about ASPs in North America as we progress into 2015 versus 4Q levels?","David L. White","So primarily, if you look at it year-over-year and you look at it quarter-over-quarter, FX basically drove 80%, 90% of the decline that we see in both those comparatives, and the same would hold true, Q4 to Q1. There are other effects. You asked about international, and I think the same would apply somewhat to North America. We do have periods of running various kinds of promotions, which yield different kinds of discount and so forth, and those sometimes have different seasonalities associated with them. So for example, we'll run specific promos and discounts heading into the Q3 for the teen season for the orthodontic channel -- orthodontist channel. So there was some of that in the fourth quarter as it relates to some of those kind of discounting programs running in Q4, but the vast majority of it is all FX.","Thomas M. Prescott","Chris, maybe another way to jump on, pile on, was mix is not so much the issue right. It's mostly FX. Mix is pretty stable around the globe, and we more or less expect that to be the case. It's mostly FX, and occasionally, some promotion, but I'd say FX is going to overwhelm those other effects.","David L. White","Yes, I was just going to say over a -- well we may see a little bit of observations quarter-over-quarter on ASPs. We talked -- I talked previously about the long-term trend in ASPs continuing to be up, and I still believe that to the point that Tom make. If you look at the percentage of our cases that are full cases versus the express cases, that percentage has been relatively consistent over time, fluctuating on a quarter-by-quarter basis by less than a point. When you look at the mix, however, though, between international and North America with the higher growth rates international and the higher ASPs they have there, they just naturally are going to become a more significant piece of the total geographic mix of our business, and that is over the long term, holding FX rates aside, should continue to drive a ASPs up.","Thomas M. Prescott","That was -- speaking of a product mix, not geographic mix. David is exactly right.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Tom, just wanted to get your perspective on how you're feeling about the U.S. market. You have -- coming into the fourth quarter, it feels like it were off to a pretty good start. Would be curious if you could give us some color on how it exited. And then in terms of the 1Q case volume guidance of flat to down, weaker than history would otherwise suggest, can you parse out some of the dynamics there?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. I'll start, and David can pile on if he chooses. First of all, we're not out of January yet. I think the year, in general, we're getting off to a start we'd expect, and that's captured in our guidance. We've got a lot of moving parts here, and all those factors are kind of caught. I mean, we -- I guess, we've got a clear line of sight to rolling out G6 in some of these other geographies. You come back North America, that will really be more limited in the near term. But in general, the team is off and running. I feel pretty comfortable about our general direction. I think if we look back to last year, it seemed like we were getting you guys -- I shouldn't say we, we're out here: Sun's out. But the Northeast, the Midwest especially, we're getting slammed by storm after storm. We were kind of looking at it last week or this week going, \"Geez!\" But I think notwithstanding that, and all in last year, that was not a very big effect for us over all over time. So in our minds, we don't exactly track dental visits. Maybe there's a lag effect or something, but I think the market is reasonably solid, healthy. I don't know what else to say other than that.","David L. White","I'll just add a little bit of color because you're looking at historical trends possibly. In my comments, basically what we said was the growth in North America quarter-over-quarter primarily in the orthodontists channel. And if you look at historically, let's say over the last 3 years and so forth, I think our quarter-over-quarter growth in North America has typically been in the low-single digits to mid-single digits from Q4 to Q1, and so I think our -- the guidance we gave for this quarter is not materially different from what we've seen over the last 3 years.","Thomas M.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us. On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our second quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligner and scanner and services. I'll also provide some color on our orthodontist and GP Dentist customers, as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will then share more detail on our second quarter financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and open the call up to your questions.","Q2 was a good quarter and we're pleased with our results. Record revenues, which increased 17.5% year-over-year, were driven by increased Invisalign volume across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, as well as higher Invisalign ASPs. We also had a record quarter for scanner and services revenues with unit volumes up over 50% year-over-year.","Our performance in Q2 reflects continued focused execution of our strategic plan, including our 3 key growth drivers, which are: market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I'll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further.","First, market expansion. This strategic growth driver encompasses the way -- the many ways we are working to grow the adult treatment category, increase our share of teen treatment and, in parallel, open up new geographies. In the teen patient segment, which is still primarily a North America focus today, we had a very good start to the summer season. In Q2, a total of 28,300 teenagers began treatment with Invisalign worldwide, up 8.6% sequentially and up 20.4% year-over-year. The summer months of June, July and August are typically the time that most teenagers start orthodontic treatment and so far, this summer looks to be solid. We're pleased with our continued progress in this, the largest and most important segment of the orthodontic market.","During Q2, we ran teen promotions intended to address potential barriers to teen adoption, including for mom acceptance. The goal of these promotions was to increase utilization among high-volume North American orthodontists who infrequently use Invisalign for their teen patients. Results were favorable as targeted doctors that participated grew their teen volume for Invisalign significantly higher than non-targeted high-volume orthos. We're continuing these promotions into Q3, which historically been our largest teen quarter.","While I'll touch on our performance by region in a moment, this is a good time to talk about driving growth in new geographies. Today, we're announcing further expansion in the EMEA region with 14 additional European countries moving from distributor coverage to our direct sales organization. As with the previous countries we added in Q1, we do not expect a material impact for some time. In the near term, we will leverage the existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales organizations to drive long-term market penetration. While individually small today, taken together, these new country markets will complement our growing base and increase critical mass across Europe. We continue to be excited about the longer-term growth potential in this important region, both in our existing country markets and these new ones.","Our second growth driver is product innovation, which aims to create greater doctor preference through an intense focus on innovation with a goal of supporting increased adoption and utilization for our products. In Q2, we continued successful programs to commercialize Invisalign G5, our latest innovation specifically designed for deep bite treatment. Deep bite is a very pervasive functional orthodontic problem that presents in almost 1\/2 of the existing ortho case starts in North America and EMEA with approximately 1\/3 of the case starts in Asia. And while experienced doctors have been using Invisalign to treat deep bites for years, Invisalign G5 is designed to make treatment with Invisalign easier for our doctors and help them achieve even better, more predictable clinical outcomes.","During the quarter, we saw a good initial use of G5, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions where doctors are routinely treating more complex cases.","And finally, brand strength, our third key growth driver. We are working to build and leverage the strength of the Invisalign brand to create consumer demand and drive purchase intent among consumers in more and more countries worldwide.","We continue to make great progress here. So let's start with North America, our largest market for consumer marketing. In Q2, we created more than 331 million consumer impressions through 426 media placements. Q2 also saw the launch of new teen-focused programs to leverage the busy teen treatment season, including new social media platforms specifically designed to engage with the teen audience on Tumblr and Instagram. To further support that strategy, we sponsored 4 DigiTour 2014 events that brought the Invisalign Teen brand directly to more than 17,000 teen consumers. Our efforts to influence the teen market will continue in Q3 as we leverage the DigiTour program and its popular YouTube channel to bring original content featuring Invisalign to millions of teens.","In September, which has been designated as self-improvement month, a variety of PR and social media will provide a relevant connection to the Invisalign brand and our outreach to teens, moms and adult patients.","Switching to EMEA, our new, more localized consumer initiatives targeted at high-potential and under-penetrated cities in Europe are proving to be successful. In particular, we're seeing strong impact in growth from these campaigns on our social media platforms with social media engagement up more than 150% over last year. We believe this has helped support our continued progress in this region.","Continuing our strategy of using real patients to tell the Invisalign story to consumers, we launched a competition in the U.K. called Invisalign Changed My Life. Past Invisalign patients can share their story of how their life has been transformed by their new smile and the 2 winning smiles and their stories will be featured in our marketing materials, on Invisalign websites and in press and social media. Winners will be announced at a VIP event at the National Portrait Gallery in London later this year.","And in Asia Pacific, we participated recently in the PR launch of 2 new Invisalign-dedicated practices in Singapore. Just 2 examples of how doctors in the APAC region are leveraging the strength of the Invisalign brand to reach consumers in their respective markets.","In combination, these 3 proven strategic growth drivers, market expansion, product innovation and brand strength, are helping to extend growth in our most important country markets, while opening up new ones.","Let's now touch on the progress we're making in these regions starting with North America. For Q2, North America Invisalign volume was up 4.2% sequentially and up 7.6% year-over-year. The sequential increase in Q2 reflects growth from both North American orthodontists and GP dentists. The year-over-year increase reflects continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased utilization from our North American ortho customers, including teenager cases.","For our international business, comprised of EMEA and APAC, for Q2, we continued to see strong growth of Invisalign case volume from international doctors with total case volume up 12% sequentially and 26.3% year-over-year, reflecting momentum across these markets.","In EMEA, growth was strong across all core countries and up 20.8% year-over-year, with France and Spain leading the way. Progress was driven by incremental investment in sales coverage, continued enhancements in clinical education programs and growing doctor confidence as innovation in Invisalign product continues.","In the APAC region, Invisalign case volume increased 42.3% year-over-year. China continued to deliver above our expectations, more than doubling case volume compared to the same quarter last year. We also saw strong growth from Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Southeast Asia countries. Doctors across this region routinely treat more complex cases and continue to more rapidly try and adopt product innovations like Invisalign G5.","In addition, given we're still in the early days of growth in this region, our doctors are realizing significant benefits from our clinical education programs. In June, we held our first ever Invisalign Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore with more than 450 Invisalign doctors attending from across the region. We are very pleased by the participation and the great post-Summit feedback. The Summit program included presentations on the development and advancement of the Invisalign system, with particular focus on Invisalign G5. Some of the most valuable elements of our Invisalign Summit program are peer-to-peer lead clinical sessions, case sharing roundtable sessions and practice development workshops. All were attended with standing-room only.","We continue to learn a great deal from our customers in this region as they deliver outstanding clinical outcomes on the most challenging orthodontic cases we see in the world today.","Turning to our scanner business. Q2 was another great quarter for our scanner and services segment, which is up both sequentially and year-over-year, with scanner units up over 50% year-over-year. During Q2, we launched the new iTero 5.2 software upgrade, designed to increase practice efficiency and significantly expand the extensive array of iTero features currently available. This upgrade enhanced the customer experience, by adding a new orthodontic laboratory workflow, Vivera Scan, Vivera Pre Debonding and new algorithms for faster Invisalign scanning. With this new upgrade, our customers have seen Invisalign scan time reductions of more than 25%, even while preserving the high-quality data required to ensure a great fit for the Invisalign system.","Vivera Pre Debonding allows the doctors to scan their patients before they debond or remove the patient's brackets and wires. This important capability allows them to order Vivera Retainers, while the patient is still in treatment, eliminating the need for temporary retention. This iTero feature is now in limited market release and expected to move to full release in mid-Q3. We also launched new iTero's monthly subscription packages and multiple scanner subscription discount programs that have been well received by new and existing customers. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our scanner business, and the positive impact that this is having on our Invisalign business.","For Q2, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted digitally from a scanner in North America rose to 32.7% compared to 30.2% in Q1 and 25.3% in Q2 a year ago.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q2 financial results. David?","David L. White","Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. With that, let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was a record $192.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior quarter and up 17.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago.","Second quarter clear aligner revenue of $179.7 million was up 6.8% sequentially and up 17.2% year-over-year. Sequential growth reflected increased case volume by both North American and international regions. ASPs were essentially flat. Our year-over-year growth reflected case volume growth across all channels, as well as favorable ASPs from a higher mix of full Invisalign products, a higher mix of international business, as well as the favorable impact of our acquisition of our APAC distributor in May 2013.","For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 119,300 cases were up 6.3% sequentially, rebounding nicely from a slow start in Q1, but offset by some softness in June in North America. Year-over-year growth of 12.4% was driven by increased utilization from our international and North American customers, as well as continued expansion of our customer base.","For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume increased 3.7% sequentially and 10.1% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume increased 4.7% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume increased 12% sequentially and 26.3% year-over-year.","In Q2, we added 920 new North American doctors and 1,380 new international doctors for a total of 2,300 new Invisalign doctors. Together, this represented a 22% sequential increase as a result of a higher number of planned training events.","Total Invisalign utilization for Q2 was 4.4 cases per doctor, up slightly from 4.3 last quarter. North American ortho utilization was 8.4, up from 8.1 last quarter. North America GP utilization was 2.9, flat from last quarter. And international doctor utilization was 4.5, up from 4.3 last quarter.","Second quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was a record $12.8 million, a 3.1% sequential increase, reflecting continued penetration and market share gains. On a year-over-year basis, our scanner and services segment increased 21.6%, driven by a 50.7% increase in scanner volume.","Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 75.6%, down sequentially 0.4 points and up 0.1 points year-over-year.","Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.8%, down 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily the result of increased training events, which are only marginally profitable. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher ASPs. Q2 gross margin for our scanner segment was 29.5%, down 4.1 points sequentially and down 4.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the result of increased service and warranty costs. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs as we reduced our scanner pricing last year.","Q2 operating expenses were $96.7 million. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $1.3 million, due primarily to increased marketing programs and headcount. This was partially offset by a benefit from a refund of medical device excise taxes we paid previously in Q1.","On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $11 million, incidental to the growth of the business, which primarily relates to headcount additions. This increase was also partially offset by the aforementioned medical device excise refund and elimination of the tax altogether.","Our second quarter operating margin was 25.3%, up 2.2 points sequentially and year-over-year. Our quarter-over-quarter improvement was primarily driven by higher Invisalign volume.","With regards to our second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 26.8%. Our Q2 rate was negatively impacted by a one-time discrete item of $2.1 million, primarily related to prior years. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.43, compared to $0.39 reported in Q1 and $0.36 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. For the second quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $131 million, up approximately 3.8% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 61 days, a 2-day improvement sequentially and was down 1 day over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $5 million, primarily relating to manufacturing capacity additions. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $69.7 million. And free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $64.8 million.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $502.7 million. This compares to $472 million at the end of 2013, an increase of $30.7 million.","During Q2, we paid $70 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan, or ASR, for an initial delivery of approximately 997,000 shares of Align common stock. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined at completion of the ASR based on the company's volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount. The ASR is expected to be completed by July 29, 2014. There remains approximately $230 million available for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization, of which $30 million is expected to be used for repurchases over the next 9 months.","Let's now turn to our business outlook for the third quarter and the factors that inform our view. We're pleased with the business, and remain confident in our ability to continue to drive growth of Invisalign globally. While customers reported stable overall patient traffic, our June case receipts in North America were a little softer than our expectations. Most teen case starts occur in the summer months, and we expect the positive impact we saw in Q2 from teenagers to continue in Q3. Consistent with previous summers, busy teen ortho practices typically have fewer consultations in order to accommodate the summer rush for kids before school starts. Q3 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for North American GPs and international doctors who spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. As such, we anticipate Invisalign case shipments to be down to flat sequentially from Q2 for North American GPs and international doctors. This is a more pronounced effect in Europe.","For our scanner business, we expect it to be down sequentially in line with lower capital equipment sales in the summer. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 118,100 to 120,500 cases, roughly flat with our Q2 results, but consistent with our historical Q2 to Q3 3-year average. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $186.3 million to $190.2 million, slightly down relative to our case volume outlook due to lower scanner revenues, higher promotional activity and other factors impacting ASPs. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75.1% to 75.6%, flat to slightly down sequentially from Q2, primarily reflecting lower ASPs as just mentioned.","We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $96.7 million to $97.4 million. This is flat to slightly up when compared to Q2 reflecting continued investment in our strategic growth drivers.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 23.2% to 24.3%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23%. And diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 82.1 million, net of any stock repurchases. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.44.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments.","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, David. We are pleased to deliver these financial results, along with continued progress on key strategic initiatives. Our long-term goal is that someday, clear aligner treatment will replace brackets and wires as the standard of care in orthodontics. When we see solid adoption of key new product innovations like Invisalign G5 and are able to grow our penetration of the teen market, which is always the hardest share to gain, we know we're on the right track. Over the next few months, the entire Align team will be committed to ensuring our customers and their practices are thriving with patients that are overjoyed, not just with their new smile, but also with the Invisalign journey that helped them get there. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move forward.","And with that, I'll say thank you for your time today and I'll turn the call back over to the operator for some questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. I wanted to start with your comments around June being a little bit softer. Your case volume guidance for the third quarter, I think, was pretty good given that you -- like you said, it is a seasonally slower quarter. Could you just maybe go into a little bit more detail on specifically what you saw in June, and kind of how that informed your outlook for the third quarter?","David L. White","Sure, Nathan. This is David. So I think you understand that when we put our guidance together, it's informed by a number of factors and so this is really just one data point of many. And the comment, specifically in the call related to a softness in June relative to our expectations, what I mean by that, we had expected a certain amount of lift from May to June. And while we saw the lift, we didn't see the lift that we had hoped for. And on the basis of that, that had some bearing on our guidance and had that not been the case, we might have guided Q3 a little bit differently. That said, also, one of the other data points are the fact that our teen business was very strong in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year, up 9% quarter-over-quarter. Another good factor, Tom mentioned that we got off to a good start. I think that's certainly one of those factors that contributes to it. June, July and August are typically weaker in North America GP practices. So it's not entirely surprising. We've certainly seen this in the past. And I think when we look at our guidance overall and we look at it relative to history, particularly from Q2 to Q3, our guidance from a volume standpoint and so forth is pretty consistent with historical Q2 to Q3 transitions. And even at that, it's up at the midpoint of guidance, it's up 14 -- 14.5% year-over-year, which we think is great relative to any peers in the industry.","Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, no, that makes a lot of sense. And I also wanted to shift quickly to ASP growth. It seemed like in North America, I think ASPs are up about 1.5%. You've seen a couple of quarters of nice growth year-over-year. I was just wondering if you could kind of help us understand what might be driving that. And as one of the factors, maybe growth from new dentists who might not be doing the volume needed to get to the discount and that might be helping North America ASPs.","David L. White","So ASPs are influenced by a number of things. When you kind of unpack it, it's dependent upon product mix. It's dependent upon geographic mix. It's dependent upon channel mix between ortho and typical GPs and how they participate in our advantage program and so forth. So if you look at it over the last year and as we look at it going forward, we continue to believe that as we treat more and more complex cases and as our international business grows, that those 2 factors will have an effect of, over a long-term, of raising ASPs. And that is fairly -- we've seen that certainly over the last year. As it relates to North America, I think the one variable there in North America that also has a bearing on ASPs in North America, primarily relates to the product mix. And that product mix is counterbalanced, you might say, by two things. One is the complex cases that our orthos are handling and as their utilization grows, and their practices grows, that tends to influence ASPs in one direction, and dependent also on which orthos that's coming from. On the GP side, where they're typically handling more simple cases that tends to be the other end of the barbell, you might say. We've not typically given breakouts or an outlook on those, but we think the trends on ASPs across all regions will be influenced by those same factors.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, just want to take sort of your long-term growth guidance of 15% to 25% in perspective. If I look over the last 18 months or so, I mean, you've been sort of trending at the bottom end of that range and if you kind of look next quarter, obviously, you're guiding below that range and I understand the issues in June may be impacting the third quarter guidance, but as I look at North America more broadly, that will be the third quarter in a row of sort of single-digit growth. And I'm just kind of curious, is there anything to talk about with respect to maturation of the market or it getting more difficult to compete for market share against brackets and wires? I mean, how should we think about the growth from a longer-term perspective?","Thomas M. Prescott","Great question and a simple statement is that we're very committed to our long-term model. We have a great deal of confidence. And then we go and test ourselves maybe against a number of measures. One is our own expectations, which we don't talk about externally. Another is industry peers, and then finally, what are we -- how much headroom do we have left? And in every direction we look, we are -- we can't even see the ceiling. Our relative penetration into -- just part of the market in North America, for example, where there has been a little deceleration is something like 9% or 10% -- 10%, 11%. So every time we evolve the product and we can better compete for complex cases like deep bite across a wider number of orthodontists or dentists that do orthodontics, we then have an opportunity to go compete for that case, but it takes time. The more complex the case, the longer that time. We get them to try 2 or 3 cases. It might take 6 to 9 to 12 months for them to see that case really progressing and then build confidence that they can deliver the results they want. So with every more significant evolution that projects to us competing for more complex cases, at least in North America and to a certain extent, Europe, the longer it takes us to do that. The exception probably for that is in Asia. What we're seeing much faster uptake on new features just because the cases they treat every day are all so much more difficult. The average case that presents is so much more complex. So they're looking for any tools that can work to solve that problem and there's less, I'd say maybe, ingrained legacy behavior among the clinicians. Brackets and wires have been here for 100 years. So for us, it's really about market adoption, clinical proof, clinical excellence to demonstrate that we can actually help them deliver those great results and an understanding. Practice by practice, we're starting a process of increasing confidence, slow steady adoption and I'll point you back to our teen share gain, which is the hardest share and most of that gain is in North America. That's the hardest case for us to win because mom, dad and the doctor are all targeted to be perfect. And if they believe there's any clinical tradeoff, they're just not going to put that kid into teen. Finally, you've raised competition and I think, look, more competition is good for everybody. Everybody's sword gets sharper, right? So what I'd say is brackets-and-wires companies, their games have all improved. That's a good thing for the industry. It's a good thing for our customers and their patients. There's more clear aligner players, but for the most part, they're at the low end and it's more noise than anything else. What's going on for us is really delivering 2 to 3x growth in a segment pointing towards mainstream, but not there yet, especially for ortho, in a segment that's growing maybe low single digits. And so we're going to compete like the Dickens and take what we can, but it is not an issue of limited headroom or maturation of market opportunity.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate those comments and maybe I can just follow up on the competition perspective. As I think about ASP, David, I appreciate your comments that the ASP is rising due to the mix and the slant towards international and more complex cases. Is there anything to say about organic pricing trends? If we were to take mix out of the equation?","Thomas M. Prescott","If you -- I think we actually try -- the couple of last slides in the webcast slide package, we try to break out what we'll call kind of full type cases and limited treatments, non-comprehensive treatments and what you can see from both of those, when we adjust, when we normalize for factors like FX and the like, we're pretty stable to up a little bit. What I would say, using North America as an example, when there's a little less volume than we expected, and you could make that as the case for June, since we had a little deceleration, both in GP and ortho, we get a little less participation from it among the advantaged doctors and that translates to them not achieving maybe the same level for advantage or getting as much total discount. We would rather have ASP go down for that reason and have them fill up their practice with Invisalign. So in our minds, that's the one element of ASP that we're not thrilled with being up a little bit. We're happy with mix shift driving that, we're happy with the rest of it. But this is an area where we continue to have opportunities to compete and it means some of our advantage doctors didn't participate as fully as we thought in Q2, but stable pricing is the message underneath all that.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Last question and then I'll jump off. David, the cash is sort of piling up on the balance sheet. You've obviously started to buy back a little bit of stock here. How should we think about the plans for capital deployment going forward? Should we think about it as more share repo down the road? Or Tom, I don't know if there's a strategic message that you want to try to deliver.","David L. White","Yes, I'll just add, when we announced in April our accelerated stock repurchase plan, we announced at the same time that we were committed to a $300 million purchase over the 3 years that are ahead of us, with the first $100 million of that being expected to occur in the first year. And so we will close that ASR completely out and -- next week. And we'll then repurchase the remaining amount under that $100 million initial tranche, you might say, over the balance of the year. And I think the only guidance we've given is that there's another -- there'll then be another $200 million to follow over the next couple of years. And I don't think we've got anything more to add to that then -- at this point.","Thomas M. Prescott","I'll finish your comment. We're -- to the extent we were going to do anything, it would probably more in the area of technology versus -- we don't feel like the money is burning a hole in our pocket. We're funding -- we have a great free cash flow machine. We're funding our research and development, our expansion around the globe, our building of brand, our development of a better company that is more scalable and those -- most of those show up on income statement, not the balance sheet. With that said, we continue to have dialogue with the board, but we're not going to run around and start looking at everything that's for sale. The idea is to build a great organic business and build out our scanner install base and bring digital tools and capabilities to our customers. That reduces friction them and leads to some benefit for us. You see that showing up in Invisalign. And we're going to pour the coal on the fire as we build out the Invisalign franchise as well. So I think at this point in time, we're not -- we're trying to stay very focused in executing the strategy we laid out at the analyst meeting a month or so ago.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe my first question builds on Glen's a little bit in North America, a little bit more specifically to North American GP volume. I believe that was up, obviously, a lot of numbers, but I believe that was up 5% year-over-year and then I'm looking through and it seems like Express was actually down year-over-year. And so can you, Tom, maybe speak specifically to North American GP growth because I'm being pulled in 2 directions. One, I would think the scanners and that should help drive utilization maybe within the GP channel, but then on the other side, is it possible sort of the growth in '12 and part of '13 was inflated a bit through sort of an Invisalign 5 and some of the promos there. So maybe if you can talk to those dynamics, that'd be very helpful.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. I guess, GP, first of all is -- building out a GP channel in the biggest GP dental market, which is North America, is a strategic priority. There are very few companies that have successfully built out with a specialty product that requires some missionary work, build out a high preference doctor product to this very fragmented base of customers that cover a huge range of procedures day-to-day in their office. We're still early in that journey, so I -- we don't think that's linear, and -- but it's very, very important to us, and we're going to get it right over time. And we still grow faster than all of our peers with consumable products and everything else that are calling on this channel, whether that's direct or whether that's the distribution. The second part of your question maybe is both mix and channel and that's Express 5 or 10, and a little more specific to GP, correct?","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","Thomas M. Prescott","And so what I'd say is two things. One, it's not a lack of emphasis by us and when we do promotions as we did maybe 1 year, 1.5 years ago on Express 5 and 10 is to get trial. Our positioning for the Express products, from the very beginning, both 5 and 10, were for the more experienced customers, not just orthos but GPs that had experience doing Invisalign treatment and could comfortably look at a malocclusion and set expectations for that patient and know what they could deliver in 5 stages or 10. It's hard and there's a limited degree of malocclusion treatment that's predictable with those shorter treatments. So I think what's happened over time, first, the good news is we're winning on the high end. We're taking share on more complex cases. We're winning in teen, which is wonderful. Our strategy at the other end was to make sure we're competing up and down the line and we're doing fine there. It's just that relative, there's more -- doctors have said, \"I'd rather just go to an assist case. I'd rather do a full case if I have to worry about doing it in 10 stages. If it's 17 stages on full, I'm fine with that.\" If they're an advantage doctor, and they're a significant advantage doctor, the difference in price isn't even that great between Express 10 and a full case. So I think the reality is, let's just call it settling in. Now I would say, and there was a question earlier, there is more noise in competition with both bracket players with specialty brackets for 6-month treatments, as well as there has been for a while a lot of players offering simple treatments, but none of them seem to work that well and what we're going to do is stay committed to delivering treatments we can stand behind, so that what we show in the ClinCheck is what gets delivered to the patient. And there's very few companies out there that can make that statement, so more of a mix shift, still in love with the channel, it's a long-term journey and I just say it's settling it. But there's a lot more movie to be seen here, I think: a, for the GP channel; and b, for the different offerings that will evolve over time.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great, I've got one more question and maybe one clarification. Just you mentioned the promotions on the teen side of things. And you've certainly run promos there before, I think with Vivera and other stuff like that. But I think, Tom, you were sort of alluding to a specialized promotion for high-volume orthos that had not really used Invisalign for teens before. So is this the start of something new here, very targeted promotions to try to get some guys on board for teen and we're sort of in the first inning of that?","Thomas M. Prescott","Short answer is yes. Attractive practices with great businesses that haven't been confident enough to use Invisalign Teen yet. I think coming on the heels of SmartTrack and G5, seeing a lot of clinical evidence and hearing from colleagues how well it's working, and then us trying to compete for the toughest case to steal from brackets and wires in that office and having some success in a targeted way. Call it increased support and focus by the team and a little better financial proposition for that practice. And I think it is very early, but so far so good. I hope we have more good news to report to you at the end of Q3, but that's a very targeted approach.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last one, just a clarification, David, I think this is for you. You mentioned some of the year-over-year margin expansion from the elimination of med device tax. But did you actually also recognize a credit in the quarter and was that a credit to the OpEx numbers that you reported?","David L. White","Yes, Jon. So there was -- there were basically 3, you might say, moving parts in the quarter. We did receive a medical device tax refund from payments we had made in early Q1 prior to our engagement with the IRS at that point in time, so those were refunded to us in the quarter. They amounted to about $1.2 million and contributed about $0.015 to EPS. On the...","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and we're done -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","David L. White","And then I was going to say the other moving parts were the ASR was about $0.005 accretion. And then we had some discrete items -- a discrete item, I guess, that relates to taxes that had a one-time, nonrecurring impact of about $0.03 unfavorable. So net-net, about $0.01 unfavorable across those 3 moving parts.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One question as a bit of a retrospective on the first half of the year. Thinking back to comments that you made in January and then gave us a bit more clarity on in April, given everything that was going on with the weather. You commented that there were patients who were having some difficulty scheduling, especially of course here in the Northeast and the Midwest. I wonder at this point, do you have a sense for, number one, whether all that volume has come back through the system? And number two, how much of an impact it might have had in terms of dynamics in 2Q relative to Q1 where you might have had a few folks come back through the system that couldn't get there in the first quarter?","Thomas M. Prescott","Steve, it's a good question and it's very, very difficult to pin down. We tried to survey our customers and kind of help interrogate their schedules and calendars to get a sense of what that rescheduling shuffle looked like, and there were 2 or 3 or 4 cycles of this in January and February and later in March and each one of those periods of prolonged bad weather sent everybody scurrying and I think at the point when we talked about it before is when that happens in an ortho office, they kind of reschedule everybody as they can. When it happens in a GP's office, where we're already a smaller part of the relative practice, a lot of people coming in are in pain. They have a serious problem. They're in the middle of a restoration. The Invisalign case reschedules in that office are going to get pushed pretty far down the path to priority. They're going to deal with people with endodontic problems and that need to get in there very quickly. So what we heard from our customers as we were getting into April was things were finally settling down. We have -- short answer is we have no quantitative view. Wish we could, but we have no quantitative view if there were ultimately people that never came back, nor do our customers know what happened. What they do know is their patient volumes, procedure volumes and patient traffic was reduced through those periods. And in general, I think most of our practices feel it's returned to normalized levels.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then one on Europe, if we think back to 2013 and the acquisition of the distributor in Asia, it was a bit of a tailwind. It sounds like you're not expecting a proportional tailwind with the change to distribution in Europe. So I guess, question one is, why is that? Is it as simple as you're just not bringing on reps from the distribution network? And then two, how could we see the contribution from the direct selling effort there ramp over time?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure, a couple of things. First, I think we've -- first of all, this is very important and it's strategic for us. It is different because in Asia Pacific, we had a going business with 50 employees and significant volume. In fact, their volume was growing faster than any other finite geography in the country. And then we also gave -- and it was -- so that was meaningful volume and it was growing 40% a year, something more than that, we -- 30% to 40%. We actually were giving that distributor 50% discount to do all of the clinical education, training, support, promotion, consumer, everything. And so we got all that volume, actually increased that volume overnight -- increased that volume, but overnight, doubled the revenue per case coming in. We would have the same scenario with this, I'll call it a steady process, that we're going at in Europe, where we've rethought -- with our distribution partner that had a very large geography in many countries, seems that our -- the distribution partner's focus was on a number of other countries and geographies, the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and not as much on former Eastern European countries, the Nordic countries, et cetera, where we had either presence close to being direct or directly adjacent to where we had meaningful mass. The idea was that rather than acquisition, we would just bring those back. We would invest in those geographies in a thoughtful, organized way. And that's what's happening. But instead of bringing in a going business, we're bringing in geography, and in a few cases, very small volumes. In the short term, we'll pivot to put small level of incremental resources, leaning on our adjacent country sales forces and management teams. And over time, we'll start slowly to build some direct teams in those -- in the more important country geographies. But it's much more of a long-term complement to the excellent growth we're seeing in Europe and EMEA. And over time, it'll be able to leverage the critical mass we've already got building into these countries in northern and southern and former Eastern Europe. Again, very different story, very important to us, but won't be meaningful in revenue terms in the near term.","Shirley Stacy","Steve, next question please?","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I wanted to start in some of the marketing initiatives o U.S. I appreciate the color you gave on that, Tom. I'm wondering if you could provide maybe in qualitative details, so piggybacking on some of the comments you guys made at your analyst day on some of the progress you're making in China, I guess, beyond the KOLs. Talk about maybe some of the barriers, I know these events you describe tend to be well attended and -- but how is it translating into volumes, again, qualitatively? And what kind of barriers are you running into, if any?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, certainly, first of all, we are doing business in all of the major institutions. The delivery of care is organized into kind of what look like hospitals. And there are a series of specialists and generalists that deliver care both to private and, I'll call it, public. And in many of these, more public hospitals, we are on -- we're in the programs to be included with those systems. It takes a long time. It doesn't mean it's every one. In parallel with that, we are -- there's clinic operators opening daily, weekly, almost. There's 20 million to 50 million reasonably wealthy Chinese to which basic health care services and oral -- access to oral care is a new thing, very, very attractive and they're very drawn to our brand. And so the third thing is we've built our business in China starting 6 years ago or something like that from developing clinical relationships and research relationships. And so we have excellent relationships and have earned respect from some of the most influential KOLs and they're actually helping us educate as part of their role, we have advisory boards over there. And in our minds, this is an incredibly valuable thing because they're treating the most complex cases we see in the world. It's stunning, the complexity they're dealing with, and we're learning more about what the appliance can do, what Invisalign can do and how we should modify our protocols. So we're actually doing clinical research over there with them. That has significantly impacted many of the hospitals and teaching institutions around China. And over time, as we talked about during the analyst day, we're going to be moving out of just the major cities to the smaller second-tier cities, that are only 10 million to 15 million population, right? So -- but we're getting good traction both on a purely private side with clinic operators, as well as the big hospitals. Not everybody, and -- but the barriers for us are really around clinical excellence, clinical education and support and we're not trying to go fast per se, we're trying to do it right. And yet, I think we said doubling, I'll just give you the number, our increase in volume, our China business was up 178% versus the same quarter a year ago. I mean, so even though we're trying to take a thoughtful approach to this, it's growing very, very rapidly. So we're pleased and the barriers are really around competition, traditional brackets and wires and there are some local players, but we're doing just fine, and we're staying humble and hungry.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that color. And just one other -- on iTero, obviously, nice progress this quarter. Where -- I guess, what type of sort of long-term run rate -- I know not -- you're not going to give longer-term guidance on iTero, specifically, but sort of maybe conceptually, what kind of growth can that segment, I mean, as you expand its sort of capabilities and as dentists -- more dentists embrace the concept of digital dentistry, what kind of growth can that segment really generate? And obviously, as it sort of ties in with Invisalign case growth, like, how big can that segment get?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure, let me give you a future state description. This is not guidance, to be clear. And we've talked about this a little bit at the analyst day. We believe that high-quality intra oral scanners will be ubiquitous over time at chair side. And busy practices will have multiple units. It may segment to where there's higher performance scanners and very low more quadrant or individual tooth to support just specific restorative procedures. But with that said, we believe they're going to be ubiquitous. And seeing that trend and believing that and being committed to supporting that with improving value proposition, better performance and having the best scanner, we -- our goal is to build the biggest standalone scanner install base in the industry. And if not #1, then a very close #2. Now can we do that against the big players? We'll see. So far, we're doing all right. We are the fastest-growing and the largest standalone install base out there of anybody. Sirona has got a huge start on everybody, most of their scanners are not standalone, they're with integrated systems. So in our mind, that's how big it is. And when we help our customers' offices, whether that be an orthodontist or a GP Dentist, become fully digital, we can help them remove friction from so many of their procedures and processes. It's better for the patient; it's better for the practice; everything happens faster, smoother, quicker; cycle times get compressed, quality goes up; we think costs will go down for everything. And we intend to be in the middle of that. So we think that's a very big market. And when we're ready, we'll start thinking globally. Again, we've -- we're building this model out in North America and at some point in time, I think, as both Raphael Pascaud and Tim Mack spoke about, there are opportunities to revisit thinking about a number of countries and regions globally, but it's a little too early for that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Tom, this is the second quarter in a row that looks like where North American doc trainings were down almost 20% year-over-year, is there something seasonal going on there? What do you -- what would -- should we look for in the second half of the year? And do you think that's a direct factor in terms of the moderating North American case volume trends?","Thomas M. Prescott","No. Let me start in reverse order here. No to the last, for sure. There is enormous interest in Invisalign in practice and we're training more orthodontists again now. We're training more GPs, we have -- and we're training a lot of doctors internationally. For a long time, there was very little training going on outside the U.S. The global rate of training for us has actually gone substantially up, but I think you're asking a question more about North America. And there are 2 or 3 factors going on. One, we're still ramping up a very new entry-level course called Invisalign Fundamentals. We're still ramping it up. We got behind in Q1 given weather and then even into Q2 where offices were in a scramble mode to reschedule patients and generate stronger cash flows and all that, and so I'd still think we're building up capability to do a more intensive Invisalign Fundamentals class, which is the new one. And we're very satisfied we're on the right track. We think there are tens of thousands more GPs that want and would like to have a procedure like Invisalign in practices -- in their practice. And so again, we don't think there's any headroom issues there. But with that said, I think this is a ramp up for us with a very new program that's a bit more intensive and more time on the front end committed by sales force. And on the back end, immediately after the training program, with a few more members of the staff, not just the doctor attending. At a time when the doctors are scrambling with weaker cash flow months and schedule in the office that were tough, so April was one of the places that showed up. But I think going forward, our clinical education programs continue to get better. We're going to see more impact and we continue to see good results in general from better entry-point training. And what you don't see, because we don't really report, we do a lot of next-level training. We don't report those because they're not new doctors trained, and that whole process is getting better as well, as we have -- we continue to be able to tell the clinical innovation story and demonstrate how they can use these new features. Those things continue to be well-attended by both experienced orthos and GPs. So no issues from our perspective, just part of the journey.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And in terms of the EMEA expansions. Just curious, why now? Why make those pushes in those markets? And is there a rate-limiting factor terms of the amount of capacity you have as a management team to focus and execute those well?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. What I -- I'll step back a little bit for a moment and what I'd say is this is not so much -- if it appears happenstance, it's not. This is really a series of -- coming out of a series of thoughtful discussions over the last 1.5 years or 2 with our partner and a realistic check-in about where their priority was going to be and the opportunity that was being missed over time with some of these countries and geographies that were being underserved. And interest by clinicians in those countries in getting trained, in getting started, et cetera. So rather than pivot back a huge number of countries overnight and hit the problem you describe, which is what we do with 25 countries overnight we've, in a thoughtful, organized way, done this in a couple of phases and you're seeing a second phase here of this and that's purposely for the reason you just described as the outcome we don't want. We want, first of all, to be able to be responsive to the customers in those regions. We want this to be a good news story. And we also just don't intend to step up and have a visible sign of what I'll say in the shorter term, fairly low productive headcount expansion in this geography. So this is a phasing process. It's being done in a thoughtful way and we're really leveraging the adjacent country, solid mature leadership teams, take advantage of that. So that's what you're seeing. And over time, we'll incrementally look for those opportunities.","Shirley Stacy","Great, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just ask 2 very quick ones here, if I could, Tom. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the European distributors there, I guess, still trying to feel out maybe the size of that. I hear what you're saying that it's small relative to AsiaPac. Anything you can give us on maybe the base of volumes there, is it 10% what was in AsiaPac? Is it 50% what was in AsiaPac? Or maybe give us employees, we know there were the 50 employees in AsiaPac or 15 sales reps in AsiaPac, anything to help us kind of size these 25 countries versus the AsiaPac efforts?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure, I'll make it very simple. 0 employees we're picking up, very little book of business, many interested customers, but consider these start-up geographies, which is the -- to the earlier question, it's a very significant -- very important to us to do, makes a great deal of sense and it's a wonderful complement to the base we're building with critical mass in these other countries. But we're basically picking up opportunity, we're not picking up volume. It's not even a volume to talk about. And so I'm not even going to put a percent on it. It's very small.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then only other question then, if I look at the second to last slide in your slide deck, the -- one of the ASP slides. I'm struck by two things. I guess, one, the big uptick we saw 3 quarters ago and the stability we've now seen in those ASPs over the last 3 quarters. So one, is it just the lack of some of the Express 5, Express 10 trialing in that, that maybe drove some of the earlier volatility around those prices that you see in that chart? Is that mainly what's been driving the stability there the last 3 quarters? And then once we get -- if I back into kind of your third quarter ASP guidance, it looks like it's somewhere right around there maybe a little bit below where it's been the last 3 quarters here on a worldwide basis, but what happens after the next quarter, I guess? Are we kind of stable at this trend line or what takes it up the next tranche from here?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. Let me just point to something you said, which is basically, yes. We had promotion -- the thing that was moving Express -- we had 2 or 3 things going on. It happened over a more extended period of time because we had both a promotion in trial and expiration of promotions that lasted a couple of quarters in North America. We also had some things going on with i7 and i14 in Europe, which wasn't as visible because there's not as much volume among GPs and they're generally treating harder cases, so there was a little less interest there. Over time, we've got a decent base built now. I think we've sorted out with experienced doctors where an Express 5 or 10 offering fits. And they use it for a patient that is not ready for comprehensive treatment, wants to spend a bit less money, but just wants to deal with a small degree of crowding or close a small space. So I'd say that's pretty steady in volume and it's -- while there's a little bit of volume growth, it's being swamped by the significant growth we're getting in teen, generally a little more complex cases and what's going on as well in Europe and in Asia. Both of those things on the full product are really moving -- geographic mix, are really, on full cases, are really moving that ASP number. And the last point, I'll let David talk a little bit about our guidance for Q3. You were asking a question about maybe why is that pointing down a little bit and I'll let David speak to that.","David L. White","Well, Jeff, you're talking a little bit about volatility. Like I said earlier, there's a lot of factors that influence ASP, and as it specifically relates to Q3, to use that as a case in point, as our business shifts a little bit more predominantly to teen business in the summer quarter, and as we see some softening seasonally in the international region, which typically has more complex cases, the higher ASPs and so forth, the net effect of that is that we see lower ASPs in Q3. Now notwithstanding the fact that may add a little bit of volatility, you might say, into the ASPs on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The comment I made earlier about the long-term trend, we still believe. We believe the trend will continue to be favorable from an ASP standpoint primarily for many other reasons, as I previously indicated. Since this is the last question, I'm just going to add one thing in there since it didn't get asked during the call and we didn't make comment on it in our prepared remarks. Last -- you'll recall in our Q1 conference call, we talked about some overall expectations for 2014 as it related to where we stand against -- relative to our operating model. Given some of the issues we had in Q1, we reaffirmed that in the second quarter -- excuse me, end of the first quarter call. And if you look at where we are today, the first 2 quarters with the Q3 guide we've given, we continue to believe, as we did when we entered -- as when we entered into 2014, that the second half of 2014 would be stronger than the first half. And a large piece of our belief was the fact that we were investing heavily in a number of our strategic growth initiatives and that the gestation period of those investments would not begin manifesting themselves until the second half of the year or later. So as we sit here at this call and as we look at the second half of the year, we continue to believe that and believe that we can deliver revenue within that operating model and we believe that our operating margin should somewhat -- should still be consistent with 2013 as we indicated the beginning of the year. So I just wanted to add that since it didn't get brought up in our formal remarks and the opportunity didn't really come up during our Q&A session. Shirley?","Shirley Stacy","We have room for one last question, I believe.","Operator","Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. John Kreger with William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","This is Robbie Fatta in for John. Just one quick one on the scanner side. As you've seen increased competition in ortho offices from a couple of other guys who have launched scanners and concentrated on that space recently, how has that impacted adoption rates by orthos? Has it accelerated them or has it taken longer as they evaluate new products?","Thomas M. Prescott","I think that's a big help. 1 year or 2 years ago, orthos were kind of scratching their heads thinking, \"I think I need to own a cone beam scanner, but I hadn't put much thought into intra oral scanners.\" They all had digital x-ray, cone beam CT, every other gadget you can imagine. Now you see orthos saying, \"I'm going to own at least one busy office.\" Now one of the drivers for that happens to be Invisalign, because we're very digitally enabled as a treatment and a customized treatment. I think over time, there -- you may see an evolution in brackets and wires with -- and other kinds of appliances that are enabled and improved by digital planning and everything else. So I think it's just going to accelerate that and as they see value, they'll do it. Now as to competition, again, everybody gets better when there's more players in it and while you -- you're not going to win every one, market adoption is a bigger force, I think, than competitive share battles. So I would rather have the tide coming in with everybody thinking, \"I've got to buy one.\" And then the opportunity to make the case that we have the best one, rather than the former. So I think while it does mean they're going to try a few different scanners and play with them -- we've actually had some people that bought a different scanner and sent it back saying, \"It doesn't do what I need, can you bring an iTero in?\" So again, we're doing very, very well and we're pleased with our progress. There's a lot of installed base sockets open and up for competition over the next few years out there.","Shirley Stacy","Actually, operator, we've got one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. Chris Lewis with Roth Capital Partners.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Tom, at the analyst day, you talked quite a bit about the product evolution of Invisalign in terms of the efficacy and applicability. So I understand you're still in the early days of rolling out G5 deep bite, but can you give us any sense of when we can expect to hear more details around new product enhancements and potential new treatment indication announcements?","Thomas M. Prescott","That's a great question. Amazingly, our customers are asking us the same thing. We just -- we try to have a discipline. We were out of our comfort zone. At the analyst day, we probably showed a little more than we were normally comfortable doing because it was very important for us to frame our strategic intent and you understood why we were confident that we could actually argue long term to think about standard of care. We'd rather not kind of sell futures either to our customers or to our owners and just would rather them know that we're working on all the major indications and our goal is to make Invisalign easier to use and more predictable than brackets and wires to get great results. So I think we showed things like extraction where there's an interest, but in terms of putting a timeframe on it and what and how we'll do it, I'd rather not do it. There are rich opportunities ahead for us either around an indication-specific solution or around a lot of other things we can do to make Invisalign more mainstream, and we're working on all those. Sorry.","Shirley Stacy","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. This concludes our call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Shirley Stacy. Please go ahead.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.","We issued first quarter 2018 financial results today via GlobeNewswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Note that, beginning in Q1 2018, the American region now includes the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Previously, Latin America was combined with the EMEA results for reporting purposes and included in the international total. While the Latin America region has been relatively immaterial to Align's overall results, we've adjusted our prior-period regional breakouts to reflect this change so our year-over-year comps are consistent.","Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 12 months. A telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 PM Eastern Time through 5:30 PM Eastern Time on May 9. To access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial 877-660-6853 with conference number 13678038 followed by pound. International callers should dial 201-612-7415 with the same conference number.","As a reminder, the information that the presenters will discuss today will include forward-looking statements including statements about Align's future events, product outlook and the expected financial results for the second quarter of 2018. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve","risks and uncertainties that are set forth in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","We've posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our first quarter conference call slides, on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","I'm pleased to report better-than-expected first quarter results and a strong start to the year for Align with the revenue \u2013 with revenues, volumes and EPS above guidance. Record Q1 revenues were up 41% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong Invisalign volume across all geographies and customer channels, as well as iTero scanner sales which are up over 84% year-over-year.","Q1 Invisalign volume growth of 31% year-over-year was driven by increased utilization, including strong teen case growth globally and expansion of our customer base, which included over 4,200 new Invisalign-trained doctors worldwide.","Turning to specifics around our first quarter results. Let's start with results of our Americas region. For the Americas, Q1 was a good quarter with Invisalign volume up 7.1% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, reflecting growth in both our Orthodontist and GP Dentist channels. In Q1, we trained 1,600 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 455 were in Brazil alone. We're also seeing a continued ramp-up for Invisalign treatment.","For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by Ortho customers with another record quarter for North America Ortho utilization of 15.3 cases per doctor. Q1 Invisalign utilization for our North American GP Dentist were also up year-over-year, although modestly and predominantly reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base, which included 900 from new North American GPs who submitted Invisalign cases for the first time this quarter.","During the quarter, we focused on key sales and marketing initiatives intended to drive growth with certain key customers. And in Q1, we continued to see higher rates among doctors in these programs than among non-participating doctors. We also saw a nice uptick in Q1 from our dental service organizations, or DSO channel. DSOs remain a very strategic part of our overall strategy, as they look to scale operations and accelerate growth for their practices through continued investment in our end-to-end digital workflow, including Invisalign treatment and iTero scanners.","At the Association of Dental Support Organizations, ADSO, Meeting in Austin last week, two of our largest partners spoke to major DSOs about their success in integrating Invisalign treatment and digital scanning into their organizations. And our special markets team continues to build on these wins across the region.","For international doctors, Q1 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 6.2% sequentially and 43.4% year-over-year, reflecting strong Invisalign volume across the board, driven by both increased adoption as well as the expansion of our customer base, which included another 2,645 new Invisalign-trained providers with roughly half of EMEA and half in APAC. From a customer channel perspective, while we continue to see strong growth from both the Ortho and GP practices, we're beginning to see more positive traction in the GP channel from segmenting our sales and marketing resources and programs specifically around each channel.","For Q1, we're continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,600 newly-trained doctors in EMEA, of which half were new Invisalign Go GPs. Year-over-year growth in Invisalign volume in EMEA was up 36.6% with record volume in all but one core country market. This performance reflects continued confidence in treating complex cases with Invisalign clear aligners, as well as success in the GP channel, which was up over 67% year-over-year.","The growth was led by Iberia and France, which were up over 40% year-over-year, and Iberia became our third largest market worldwide for the first time following China, our second largest market after United States. We also saw strong growth across our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and Benelux, where we continue to increase our sales and marketing resources across the board and began to implement consumer marketing programs.","In APAC, Q1 Invisalign volumes were up 56.1% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia with China solidifying as our second largest worldwide market. Our Q1 results reflect continued strong growth overall and especially from teen cases, which were up 73% year-over-year.","In addition, we saw strong growth from our GP channel, which was up over 70% compared to last year. We also continue to see positive uplift from Invisalign customers with iTero scanners. For Q1, Japan had a record quarter and showed very strong growth from doctors, who have previously purchased iTero Element scanners.","Finally, Q1 was an all-time high for Invisalign volume and our smaller expansion markets in Thailand, Singapore and Korea, where we are still very early in their development and adoption cycles.","Now, turning to the teen market. In Q1, 69,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 8.8% sequentially and 40.9% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions and increasingly among younger teens and tweens. Q1 was the sixth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volumes grew faster than adults.","Overall, teen case growth is outpacing adult growth on both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products. For Q1, year-over-year Invisalign Teen patient growth for North America's Orthos increased 33% and internationally was up 60%. The average age among teenagers continue to get younger and younger, falling 6 months over the last seven quarters to 14 years old. This trend in average age should continue downward, as we commercialize Invisalign products that support treatment of young teens and children, including Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First, which we announced earlier this month.","Invisalign Teen with Mandibular Advancement, or MAF, as we call it, continues to ramp internationally. It is currently pending FDA approval in the United States, which is slotted for approval in the second half of this year. The lift analysis that we have suggests a direct halo effect from MAF users that results in a higher percentage of teenagers treated with Invisalign clear aligners. Invisalign First clear aligners is a new Invisalign treatment designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition.","Phase 1 treatment, which makes up roughly 20% of case starts each year, is early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted, typically ages 6 through 10.","To-date, Invisalign First clear aligners have been used to treat over 600 patients and will be commercially available beginning July 1 in 2018.","Earlier this month, we announced an expanded Invisalign product portfolio that includes new options and greater flexibility to treat a broader range of patients. The revamped Invisalign product portfolio offers doctors more choices by extending desirable features across the entire portfolio and creating Invisalign treatment packages, as well as a new Invisalign First option to treat young patients with early mixed dentition. The new Invisalign clear aligner treatment options will be effective July 1, 2018.","Today, we announced a new more user friendly version of our Invisalign Go product and digital platform that offers greater flexibility and expanded treatment options for simple teeth straightening cases. Invisalign Go offers intuitive Invisalign experience designed for GPs worldwide, who are seeking to integrate clear aligner therapy into their thriving comprehensive dentistry practices.","We started the year off with strong consumer interest in the first quarter, over 4 million unique visitors to Invisalign websites worldwide, up 54% from the same quarter last year. More than 500,000 potential patients search for an Invisalign provider on our Doc Locator webpage, up 27% from the same quarter last year.","Almost 220,000 consumers opted in for follow-up, and the Invisalign social media community grew over 20% year-over-year, adding 688,000 consumers who are following the Invisalign brand worldwide. All metrics for tracking consumer interest are up with especially strong growth in website visitors across APAC and opt-ins in Americas region.","During the quarter, we also expanded on our customer outreach through the addition of our second Invisalign pilot store near our headquarters in San Jose, California. We're seeing great initial ramp-up in both San Francisco and San Jose stores, as we connect consumers to authorized Invisalign providers and we'll continue to monitor store activity. The Invisalign stores are a doctor-based model. Consumers who visit an Invisalign store are referred to a doctor's office where a doctor performs a personal clinical examination of the patient and a treatment plan. The doctor will follow the patient until the case is completed.","In Q2, we are opening two additional pilot stores on the East Coast, one in Bethesda, Maryland and another in Philadelphia area. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these four locations and sharing our progress throughout the year.","As we head into our highest investment period of the year for our consumer marketing program, which includes the very important summer season for teenage case starts, we plan to increase spend across mom and teen marketing programs to focus on raising awareness and turning more consumers into Invisalign patients through our doctor's offices.","In Q1, iTero revenues were down 10% sequentially, as expected following a strong Q4, which reflected year-end seasonality in the capital equipment business. Year-over-year, Q1 scanners were up 84%, reflecting very strong growth across all regions and reflects how central a digital approach is to overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatments. Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.","For the first quarter, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to a record 67.2%, up from 65.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased to 43.1%, up from 41.4% in Q1 last year. To-date, more than 7.7 million orthodontic scans and 2.7 million restorative scans have been started with iTero scanners.","Today, we announced the expansion of our iTero Element portfolio with the launch of the iTero Element 2 and the iTero Element Flex scanners. These additions build on the existing high-precision, full color imaging and fast scan times of iTero Element portfolio, while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows.","The next-generation iTero Element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2x faster startup and 25% faster scan processing times compared to iTero Element. The new iTero Element Flex is a wand-only device that transforms compatible laptop computers into a highly portable scanner that works anywhere. It's perfect for practices with multiple locations who need a scanner that is both convenient and easy to transport. The new scanners will be showcased at the AAO meeting next week.","Today, we also announced that we'll have received market approval for iTero Element intraoral scanner from the CFDA, that's the China Food and Drug Administration and we've begun offering the iTero Element scanner in China. Intraoral scanners have less than a 2% penetration rate in China today and are expected to grow 6x by 2020. The iTero Element scanner launch in China not only supports growth of our base Invisalign clear aligner business, but also represents a major milestone for digital dentistry in China.","Finally, in the doctor-directed at-home channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub with a 19% equity investment in the company. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners, which are non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q1, shipments to SDC were down sequentially, as expected, reflecting SDC's desire to produce their own clear aligners.","Today, we issued a separate press release commenting on SDC's allegation that the launch and operation of our Invisalign store pilot program constitutes a breach of non-compete provisions. As disclosed previously, we dispute SDC's allegations and intend to continue on Invisalign store pilot program and we oppose and defend ourselves in these proceedings. While this dispute does not impact our existing supply agreement with SDC, which is in effect through 2019, we anticipate minimal volume from SDC in Q2 in the second half of 2018.","With that, I'll turn it over to John.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Now, for our Q1 financial results. Total company revenue for the first quarter was a record $436.9 million, up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 40.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes a five point benefit from favorable foreign exchange. Clear aligner revenue of $385.5 million was up 5.8% sequentially on higher than expected volume.","Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 36.5% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign ASPs. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $5 from Q4 to $1,310, reflecting favorable foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by sales promotions and revenue deferrals. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $40, reflecting favorable foreign exchange, price increases and product mix partially offset by sales promotions and deferrals related to additional aligners.","For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 272,200 cases were up 6.7% sequentially and up 30.8% year-over-year, driven by growth across all regions. For Americas' Orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 8.5% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year. For Americas' GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 5.1% sequentially and up 19.6% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.2% sequentially and up 43.4% year-over-year.","Our scanner and services revenue for the first quarter was $54.4 million, down 10% sequentially due to the lower volume from the Q4 seasonality effect and up 84% year-over-year, primarily due to higher volume partially offset by lower ASPs due to promotions and discounts.","Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 74.9%, down 0.6 points sequentially and down 1 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77%, down 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to increased aligners per case and higher training costs, partially offset by higher Invisalign ASPs.","Clear aligner gross margin was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to regional expansion of our manufacturing activities partially offset by higher worldwide ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 59.2%, down 2.8 points sequentially due to lower scanner ASPs related to promotions and discounts. Scanner gross margins were up 3.1 points year-over-year primarily due to lower services costs partially offset by lower scanner ASPs.","Q1 operating expenses were $229.2 million, up sequentially 10% and up 31.8% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our go-to-market activities including higher advertising spending, geographic expansion, as well as increased compensation related to expenses due to higher head count in our planned annual increase in employee compensation programs.","Our first quarter operating income was $98.2 million, down 10.4% sequentially and up 59.2% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating margin was 22.5%, down 3.5 points sequentially and up 2.6 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to lower gross margin due to operational expansion activities, higher operating expenses as just described and lower SmileDirectClub-related revenue. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates.","With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 2.9%, which includes $23.3 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and is down by approximately 89.5 points compared to 92.4% in Q4 of 2017 primarily due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December last year.","First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.17, up $1.04 sequentially and up $0.32 compared to the prior year. Recall that Q4 2017 diluted earnings per share of $0.13 included $86.6 million expense or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Finally, in Q1, we adopted ASC 606 revenues from contracts with customers using the full retrospective method. While the impact to the Q1 2017 and Q1 2018 P&Ls are immaterial, the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 has been recasted to comply with ASC 606 requirements.","MOVING on to the balance sheet. As of the first quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long term investments were $673 million. This compares to $761.5 million at the end of 2017, a decrease of approximately $88.5 million, primarily due to $100 million in stock repurchased during the quarter. Of our $673 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $236 million was held in the U.S. and $436.2 million was held by our international entities.","Q1 accounts receivable balance was $361.5 million, up approximately 11.5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSOs, was 74 days, up 5 days sequentially and down 3 days from 77 days in Q1 last year. Even though our accounts receivable aging profile has improved, the Q1 DSO was up sequentially as a result of increased sales with extended payment terms that are available in certain regions.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $57.6 million, primarily related to building purchases and improvement, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity, as well as our global expansion efforts including the new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China mentioned last quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $77.3 million, up $29.7 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow from the first quarter defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $19.7 million.","During the first quarter, we also report \u2013 repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $100 million under the April 2016 repurchase program. We have $100 million remaining available for repurchase under this existing stock repurchase authorization. Other significant cash flow activities during the quarter included the receipt of $30 million from SmileDirectClub for repayment of their existing line of credit and we paid $47.8 million in employees' taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units.","With that, let's turn to our Q2 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to grow significantly on a sequential basis as the European market is coming out of their winter season. And most of the APAC market we're observing Lunar New Year in the first quarter.","For the Americas region, we expect Q2 to grow as our Ortho and GP customers are seasonally busier and as we continue to make progress in our Latin America expansion. We continue to invest in our iTero go-to-market activities. We started selling iTero Element in Brazil in Q1, and we have started selling iTero Element in China in Q2. We expect sequential increase in iTero units sold and revenues.","As Joe mentioned earlier, we are currently in litigation with SmileDirectClub regarding our Invisalign store pilot. And while this does not impact our supply agreement, the state of our relationship, we are assuming minimum volumes for SmileDirectClub in Q2 in the second half of 2018.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 296,000 to 301,000 cases up approximately 28% to 30% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $460 million to $470 million, an increase of approximately 29% to 32% year-over-year. We expect Q2 gross margin to be in the range of 74.2% to 75%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning and manufacturing operations, partially offset by higher ASPs. We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $245 million to $250 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go-to-market activities.","Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 21% to 21.8%. Our effective tax rate, including an excess tax benefit of about $10 million should be approximately 13%. We expect a $1 million to $2.5 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.6 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06.","In addition, as we continue to operational \u2013 our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $65 million to $70 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10 million to $11 million.","Now, let me turn to our view of 2018. Based on the momentum in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low 30s. We also expect Invisalign volume and \u2013 revenue and volume to be growth in that same range.","Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we expect operating margin for the full year to be flat to slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John, and thanks to those for joining the call today. I'm pleased with our start to 2018 as well as our continued progress and execution of our strategic growth drivers. There are a lot of changes happening in Dentistry and Orthodontics today. But the industry remains healthy and I think customers are starting to see new opportunities for how they treat patients and reach new customers. We're looking forward to an exciting and productive AAO Meeting in Washington, D.C. where we'll get to showcase our new products on the scanner side and also with Invisalign First.","We're also going to have a pop up version of our Invisalign pilot store as a way to answer customer questions and to get their perspective on our program. Then, we'll be in Singapore at the end of May, hosting our third Asia-Pacific Summit. We will be expecting about 1,000 delegates from across the region attending a two-day peer-to-peer education event. We've got a lot going on in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming financial conference at our Investor Day in New York on May 23. Thinking about Monday for sure. On May 23. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll open up to your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks guys for the question. Joe, just looking at the expected new revenue growth rate for the year, you know now above the long-term model. I'm sure it's a combination of several factors, but I was hoping maybe you could just maybe in ranked order attribute what really has gone better than expected so early in the year, if we think about teen off to a good start on the new product launches. Obviously, iTero seems to be pacing much better than certainly we were expecting. Could you maybe just give us some insight into what out of the gate this year has gone better than planned?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, we had an aggressive plan for the year. But to start off, Bob, I'd say, if you look at the international business, it continues to be very strong with APAC and EMEA, really good performance in the Americas particularly around North America, too. We started to segment it. You mentioned it. Our teen product is up pretty substantially that way. iTero sales have been terrific in that sense. We talked about how customers more and more are recognizing that whole digital workflow and how important it is. And you can see with our scanning now North American being close to 67%, that's just really working out well. And we know when they purchase iTero scanner, we see more Invisalign sales.","Lastly, I'd say our segmentation \u2013 I mentioned it in my script too, is the segmentation of GP and Ortho very specifically and also segmenting consumers in the sense of our Concierge service and how more and more we target consumers and lead them into specific docs from a Doc Locator standpoint. And that's gone a little better than expected too. So, overall, the company has been executing well across geographies and across our segmentation and product plans.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And I appreciate that. And then, it looks like you're seeing some early traction already from Invisalign First. I was wondering if maybe you could share with us how that launch of a product like that changes the addressable market that you can actually go after. Just getting some thoughts from you would be helpful around how much more expanded that the younger market becomes with a product like First?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. First of all, those 600 cases we did, that product launches in July. Those were actually just cases we put in place from a clinical study standpoint to prove the whole thing. So, really, that 600 is \u2013 I mean, you're going to see us do more and more clinical work like that to do a lot of cases, Bob, just to make sure that we have good evidence for our customer bases we go out there to work on.","Secondly, when you look at the teen marketplace, palatal expansion, or what we call Phase 1 represents about 20% of the marketplace. Now, this is dental expansion. It's not morphology or bone expansion like you have in rapid palatal expansion. So, in the past, we said we've roughly can do 60% to 65% of the cases with Invisalign. What Invisalign First dental expansion does is expand that that market served opportunity another 10%.","And then, we'll follow that with a rapid palatal expander that we're currently going through now, and that will increase it another 10%, too, so we can cover that whole 20% Phase 1 part that you have with teens out there. And that also has a good entree for us because often it's Phase 1, Phase 2 treatments were teens or young children that are 7 to 8 age have the palate expansion play and then it goes on to dental kind of work from an orthodontic standpoint later on in their teens. And so, there's a good transition period for that, too. So it's a great product. It's targeting that segment of the marketplace that we haven't had technology at before and it's specifically an orthodontic product that we've developed here.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Awesome. Great. Thanks for the questions.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Bob. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, to the extent you're comfortable, I would love to just hear your view on kind of what the path forward is with respect to SDC, SmileDirect. And then, John, any chance you could share with us the percent of cases that you manufactured for them in the first quarter?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","We can't really get into specifics. And obviously, we're going through litigation, we have to work through litigation. I'll just say we continue to have a good relationship with David and his team, and we just have a disagreement in the sense of obviously the contract that we're in and we're going to work through this from a litigation standpoint, so as that develops, we'll be able to be more clear with you as to what's going on.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. And then, one more. Joe, with respect to the Invisalign store model, would be curious to hear your views on how that's tracking relative to plans. It looks like you pulled forward perhaps by a couple of quarters the East Coast build outs. What are some of the things you're learning and what have you learned so far from the initial experience?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Brandon, first of all, we didn't pull those forward. That was in our plan as we had for 2018 and we're just sequentially putting them in. And we've learned \u2013 honestly, these stores, we've learned a lot in the sense and these \u2013 what we learn helps our doctors an awful lot too about how you take a basic consumer and you turn them into a patient. We learned that visualization is really important. The speed of that visualization, I mean, you scan, you can show a patient what their teeth are going to look like with certain kind of treatment options, gives them a lot of confidence then to go to a doctor and to see a doctor and to complete that treatment piece. We've learned a lot about our software too in the sense of how it has to respond from a patient standpoint.","There's also a lot that we're doing from a marketing standpoint in the sense of turning interest from a consumer over to a store and then back to a doc. In other words, turning consumers into patients also. Through all that, I'll tell you the iTero scanner again is really critical in being able to do this. It's really the key on the visualization piece. But also, our treatment software planning in the sense of making it as real time as possible, so patients can see how their teeth will move and what their smile will look like. Those combinations become really important, not just in the store, but as we translate that software to our doctor partners.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Brandon. Next question, please.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, can you give us a sense in terms of the feedback that you're hearing from your field sales force on the competitive front? Are you seeing any changes perhaps in promotional activity or pricing from competitors at least at the low end?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No, we haven't seen any change at all, John. I mean, we \u2013 I mean, the same cast of competitors are still out there that we had before. Obviously, we expect the 3M product at the AAO. We are pretty sure to see one there. We saw the supply announcement at the MTM expansion in the 510(k) that they've done. But we haven't seen that translated to any kind of strategy or implementation in the marketplace yet. We expect to see that in the second half. Our guess, John, is pretty much what we've been telling you and the rest of the teams over the last couple years is, we expect this to be midrange products.","So in the 26 aligner or less kind of an area, we expected kind of a slow ramp up just because of the nature of how you have to scale in this business takes some time in treatment planning and also manufacturing. So I mean, you can see with our kind of bullish forecast for the second half of the year that John just called. We pretty much had this in place in the sense of what we thought we would face and we haven't really changed that analysis since we put the plan together last year.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up on the scanner business. Did you see any kind of stocking by Patterson in the U.S. that might cause sales to slow as we move through this year or do you view that as end demand tracking as well as it would appear?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No stocking here. In demand, that's a policy we have here.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. Can you speak to the more recent financing pilot, I guess any surprises with that sort of initiative and when that would be a more meaningful contributor to growth?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. This is John. The pilot that we have is \u2013 took place in end of fourth quarter and through the first quarter, we saw great results. And it is going wider across the U.S. starting this quarter, where customers now \u2013 customers and ultimately the patients have a lot more flexibility in terms of how they want to finance and work through different financing options that they might have.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I'll follow-up later there and then on \u2013 can you speak I guess on China and opportunity there I guess as well as the competitive landscape not just maybe from the clear aligner segment but also the broader iTero opportunity with the launch announced today? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think \u2013 it's Dr. Joe Hogan. We're excited about that. I mean, our growth in China, China is our second largest market, our growth over there has been tremendous. It's hard to believe that right now everything we do in China is basically PVC impression. So and I mentioned in my script about 2% penetration of intraoral scanners in China. So from a competitive standpoint, our market is wide open in this sense and you could see that from those kind of \u2013 now we have to sell, we have to train, there's a lot of things we learned in Japan, because the iTero scanner being approved in Japan last year in the sense of how you have to ramp up and a lot of technology and people to bring our customers up to speed and saw that friction we are anticipating for this year as we ramp up in China, we're putting people in place and training in place, to be able to get that done.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Kevin, on for Matt today. I wanted to start with the mandibular advancement ramp abroad, kind of what's most driving that strength. I've heard about it being incredible for the last two quarters. And then secondly with that assuming approval here in the U.S., how fast exactly is the U.S. ramp? Is this something that Ortho customers have been asking for a long time? Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Kevin. It's Joe. First of all, I'd say from a math standpoint, the ramp overseas, this is just a product that's unique. You obviously address mandibular issues and these are people, teens that are between the ages of 10 and 12 usually with that bone development through a jaw standpoint. And there's really nothing in the world to tell you have twin block and things like this, that's looks like a torture device basically with metal that's used to move kids forward with also composites. What this does is it moves your jaw forward with removable aligners and also straightens your teeth at the same time. So it's a true breakthrough for that end of the market and I think that's why you see really good pickup.","Secondly is all of these products as it moves in the United States, I wouldn't model some kind of huge increase in teens because of mandibular advancement in the United States, because there is always a slow takeoff of this because orthodontist want to try it, they want to see success with their patients, they build that kind of credibility to the product line, they continue to move on. So from a North America standpoint, this is more of a 2019 discussion with math in the sense of maybe significant kinds of opportunities than I would say in the second half of this year","Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Joe. That's really helpful. I just had one follow up on a previous question on the competitive front and then additionally with the DTC effort. I was just curious are you hearing from your customers specifically becoming increasingly aware of the additional offerings in your view? And secondly, are they pushing back","a little bit on pricing and looking for better discounts and things like this as a result of the DTC effort increasing and then also kind of layering on new products in the next coming years?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Kevin, I'd say look there's increasing awareness because I mean, it's mainly SDC in North America has really extensive advertising and so it's hard to watch TV and not run into in Invisalign ad or an SDC ad in that sense. But I wouldn't say, our customers always want lower prices like almost any other customers in the world, and anything else to sell. So I wouldn't say that the SDC price range has created more sensitivity with our orthodontic and GP customers out there.","I will say that there is a price elasticity curve and obviously that kind of lower very I'd say minor type of tooth movement kind of things that opens up a new segment in the marketplace that frankly hasn't been serviced in a big way before. And so I think it just makes doctors aware of the more of a segmentation in the market of not doing a full bite correction, but just doing maybe your social six or just correcting a smile that someone is not comfortable with, that's a new segment in the market. It's priced in a different way and I'd say that's not a pushback on us on price it's more of a look at how to service those patients or what's the best products to do that with.","Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A it's new one. Hey thanks for taking the questions.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey Steve.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve. Steve, your friends are here at...","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good to talk to you. The GP number in the quarter kind of sticks out in a really good way, really","on a tougher comp kind of influx. Is it something going on in GP in the U.S. I mean, we don't have you know I go out in the field, what was the magic there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","You know I don't \u2013 you know, it's not magic and it's not a surprise Steve I'd say. First of all SDO \u2013 I mean the DSO marketplace has been big for us right. So you know our work with Hartman, what's going on there and some other dental service organizations, team in North America has been very good at executing around those opportunities.","Secondly, honestly, the increased advertising that that we've been doing, okay, has an overall halo effect with driving patients to GPs asking for Invisalign treatment. And we've noticed that since last year and we started cranking up advertising, so that is a kind of a residual effect or a second order effect that help the GPPs.","Thirdly, Steve is we're doing more and more segmentation on salespeople, calling on GPs in a GP kind of a way. In other words, understanding GP workflows, they don't want to be orthodontists, having products like you know that are more simple for them to use in the sense of utilizing that within the workflow of a normal restorative kind of a dentistry type of workflow. So those three areas are doing primarily.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Super helpful. Thanks for that. And then you guys, you may have set a new record for press releases in one afternoon. I mean you introduced a lot of new stuff today and we could spend a lot of time on any one of them. But I wonder if there's any way to give us as a sort of high level of view Joe and what you think these products mean for the growth profile of the company over the next two years, the sum total of getting iTero into China and getting the GP channel you know a little bit more automated, getting more cameras on the market. What does this mean for the next two years or three years? Thanks so much.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, first I'd be completely honest with you too. We're still learning, right. I mean, if you remember like a year ago, we weren't \u2013 we wouldn't really be tied down to tell you that we sell more iTero than we sell more aligners. Today I'd tell you a very concretely because we have enough data today that we sell more iTeros, we sell more aligners. We're gaining a lot of confidence in APAC as we continue to grow, like I mentioned on a previous question is in Japan, we learned a lot about what iTero can do, as you start to ramp up in a new market like Asia. Now, Japan is completely different than China has been completely how you do business there, but we do \u2013 we know how to go in there and we can anticipate in a sense of what China will need in the kind of uptake we'll have with those kind of scanners.","So the iTero's that we just announced the two products in iTero, remember this is the equipment business. I grew up in equipment business and medical, that these are platforms, right these are new platforms that we're moving forward on that help to extend what we already know in that sense. So like the flex product allows you to put it into a compatible computer, move it around the different offices, that's what our customers are basically asking for, it's sort of break \u2013 new breakthrough in scanner technology is an extension. You're going to see us continue to do that as we work off a successful platform that allows us not to just go wider from a geographical standpoint like China, but to go deeper in a sense of the workflow and what our orthodontists and our GPs really want out there.","Now I would look at \u2013 when you look at Invisalign Teen first the product we just announced, that's truly a breakthrough. When you think for years, we really couldn't do teeth that you know weren't completely erupted. They didn't have permanent dentition. Now we threw a lot of technology in understanding over the year, we could predict what those eruptions are going to be and that's what we've programmed in that team first product line that's wide open, so another 10% market share for us. But you've been with us long enough Steve to understand that the take up of those things are always cautious and it takes time, but it does establish","and it takes time, but it does establish that and when we do the rapid palatal expansion that will establish you know another 20% of the marketplace that we haven't had before. So I mean just look at this is the continuum march of Align Technology to broaden overall our opportunities from a depth standpoint of penetrating the marketplace and from a breadth standpoint in moving into new geographies with those technologies too.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really appreciate the color. Thanks again.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Misra of Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital","Hi. I appreciate taking the call. A couple of questions. One on the store pilot, just kind of trying to get a sense for what the revenue potential that you see out of that is in the long-term? It sounds like you're having us moderate some of our expectations here based on what the contribution could be from SmileDirect itself as you guys work through you know your negotiations with them; and if you could give us some information on that, that would be great?","And then secondly, maybe just a housekeeping question just on the EPS line, the 5 points of currency. What was the flow through down to the bottom line on that? Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","John, I'll take that last one.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that first on Ravi on the EPS, you know, so 5 points on revenue and \u2013 we are \u2013 our model works as you know usually we get about 3 times the benefit on revenue as it is to profitability.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","So, Ravi, on the store pilot, we were not going to share any data on the store pilot right now. We call them pilots for a reason, because we're learning and we're growing through that learning and you know it just becomes more understandable because we have more data points, but we'd be happy to share that with you.","As far as the SDC and all, we haven't shared specifically what we expect from quarter-to-quarter. I have never wanted you to really evaluate Align stock on SDCs, we sell the SDC never wanted to do that. And so when you say, we're kind of moderating your views of volume I would say, we're talking lower 30% for this year, that's not a moderation in this sense of what we think the growth is. We just want you to not try to handicap that with SDC volume. This is our inherent volume that we're generating in this business.","Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital","Yeah and I think that's pretty clear given your case start by guidance in the low 30s now. So I appreciate that. And then finally, just on the reapportionment of the Latin American sales, can you just talk about whether that's going to \u2013 is that just a reporting issue or are you going to be realigning some of the business units internally as well with that? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No, I mean what that does Ravi is, we have a regional strategy here, right. We have APAC from an Asia standpoint, we have EMEA from Europe. We've always had just North American organization, it's been kind of Latin America was reporting into another part of the organization. And so this just straightens out our organizational intention of having regions in each one of the three key areas. And \u2013 but frankly, and then we bought up our distributorships in those areas, in Latin America, and also Brazil and we're moving forward in those areas. So you saw many doctors retrained in Brazil alone. These are good opportunities for us and it allows us to focus on it in a more of a regional sense and be able to transfer best practices within the Americas throughout the organization. So it's just a \u2013 it's a move it's in line with our regional structure.","Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital","Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey Jon.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe two, the first one just the \u2013 on the new \u2013 iGo sort of iTero offering, is there a price point on that product, I didn't see it in the release and you know clearly you don't seem overly concerned with competition, but with that new iGo, iTero offering, I believe it's up to 20 stages. Joe is that sort of the part of the market that you do view as most susceptible and a competition does come in the next couple of weeks where they're going to try to crack the code a bit? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","John you know this well and your analysis is right, if you take 15 up to 26, I mean that's been kind of a vacancy in the product portfolio for years. And so iGo wasn't derived without an understanding of that okay. Yeah, we do \u2013 I wouldn't call that \u2013 you know when you \u2013 if you really stand back from this, trying to do a full case with all the complexity it has to do with full cases. If you were a competitor coming in here, it's a very difficult thing to do.","You want to kind of gradually learn and ramp up to that. So the logical, our logical conclusion is, yeah I mean, we're probably going to see more competition in the below 30 area. The good thing about that John, that's not new to us. We've seen competition from MTM and Angel Align and you can go down the list of competitors we've seen globally, ClearCorrect or whatever in that specific area. But when you look at Maui when you look at iGo, Maui was the structure we put in place or whatever. It just gives us more flexibility for our customers to be able to offer these products up and down the range than what we've had before.","So yeah, could we respond better to competition? Yes. Is that an area we think they'll come in? Yeah, but we've already seen that and this is just a continuation of how we've been working with our customers and how we structure our product portfolio.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate you read the reports Joe, I just need others do as well. Just to pivot for a moment, the scanners and driving utilization in the U.S., that's clearly played a big role over the past several years and we're seeing the scanners playing a bigger role globally, and you mentioned just starting to get into China. When you take a step back, is there any reason why the utilization step up which you now seem much more comfortable sort of verifying. That utilization step up would be any different globally especially someplace like China or Japan versus what we've seen in North America. In other words when we look out two years or three years from now, could that be sort of the next leg of growth in some of these more emerging markets? Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Answer to that question is just a flat out, yes. I mean I don't think it's going to be any different in China. It hasn't been different Japan. We saw an uptake with the customers that took the initial iTeros there at John significantly. So we expect China to be the same way and other countries too. You know in Brazil, I think we've been successful with iTero in Brazil also. So yeah, that is another component of growth in the company overall. What's great is it's synergistic growth, right. You have equipment growth, but it really leads to the growth of our core product line which is Invisalign.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first one, on the tax rate, so 13% for 2Q. Just wondering what should we be modeling for the full year?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","The guidance that we had given for total year was, earlier on was 18%, so 18% in total would be what you should use, Richard.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, so that's unchanged. And then Joe, just going back to the question I was asked earlier on competition and how if at all, it's factored into your outlook. I guess just can you comment on more specifically how you contemplated the impact of any incremental competition on your prior outlook. And I appreciate you revised your outlook upward and that's a bullish signal. But compare the current factoring of competition compared to kind of how you thought about it previously and if you could get a specific as possible, is it price, is it maybe just a little less utilization you otherwise would have felt comfortable providing to The Street just how are you thinking about that in quantifying it?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hasn't changed for a year, honestly I mean, you can tell what we initiated during the beginning of the year we didn't think we'd have any really major competitive plays in that sense. We knew we'd see more competition, but we basically looked at our business and with the momentum of the business and projected that forward and you're seeing it within our numbers, there's no specificity that I want to share in the sense of what we think and how much in ASP and what areas. Just take a look at our bullish forecast going forward and as competition becomes more visible to us and more in line, we'll share with you what we're seeing and how we look at the business.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","And a similar follow up to that line of questioning. Anything baked into your outlook specifically for mandibular contributing in the back half. I know you expect approval, but is there anything baked in for actual contribution to revenue and same on iTero. It feels like that came \u2013 the approval in China came a little bit ahead of plan I thought you had been talking about a second half kind of ramp for that and approval for that, was that a little earlier than expected?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","First of all on MAF, no I wouldn't plan on anything from a \u2013 that would be material on MAF as I mentioned and the other thing for North America when we finally get it approved. On China, we were happy to move that through. We've had good work with our Chinese partners over there to move it through. Right now, we're not calling any upside on that I mean, as we indicated, we've had good iTero growth. We think that'll continue as we \u2013 it's not just about how fast you can sell iTero in China, there's a lot of infrastructure work you have to put in place as far as training and putting things in place to be able to sell through China from an infrastructure standpoint. So what's great about that is, we can kind of get a quarter up on that as if it would have been the second half of the year then we wouldn't have as much opportunity to be able to move that product.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Good afternoon, Joe and John. Thanks for taking the question. I guess for us just one or two quick follow-ups here on the addressable market. First probably an easy one but just to make sure to clarify here, when we're talking about this 20% of untapped orthodontic case starts you can now treat with Invisalign First. That 20%, that is within the prior industry view of roughly 10 million worldwide annual orthodontic case starts. Is that correct?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, first of all, it's not 20%, okay? Invisalign First is about 10% because that's dental expansion, which means you're just really taking the teeth and rounding the arch, right? Rapid palatal expansion moves the bone, moves the palate, mouth. So, 10% more of the market would be Invisalign First, another 10% would be for rapid palatal expansion.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve, you're talking 20% of cases are related to Phase 1, and that's correct.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","That's right.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","What Joe is explaining is you're talking about TAM, right?","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Correct. Yeah. More on the TAM that's correct. And really, I mean the more important question I wanted to get to at the end of the day really was that when we think about the 10 million worldwide orthodontic case starts TAM. I guess my real more critical question here is once Invisalign First is generally available and also once you do have U.S. approval for mandibular advance. And I'm just curious where we would stand after those events just on the approximate percent of that 10 million worldwide orthodontic case starts. Do you think you could treat right now overall with the overall Invisalign product profile and approval, that's really the more important question I wanted to ask.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think the simple one on that Steve is it \u2013 before Invisalign First, we said 60%. Invisalign First takes us to 70%. Once we get rapid palatal expansion, it takes us to 80%. And that's the $10 million case starts that are out there, though that's based on 25% adult and 75% being teens. So, if you really want to nail that number, you're going to have to take 75% of 10 times 0.8.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good evening, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe. Let me go after the competition question maybe one other way here, I think we're all trying to circle around different things. But you guys are launching obviously a ton of stuff right now with the iGo in the Phase 1 and iTero expansion all that stuff. What's your view in the second half here, you guys expand the market quite a bit. And so, competition gets some share, but you guys are expanding markets so fast that you can put up that solid or that very strong second half guidance that seems to be implied there now or do you just really think competition doesn't get much traction? You know your comps get tougher in that so it's getting a little messy to try to figure out kind of how much of this is market expansion? How much may be competition, is this or isn't having an impact? But just conceptually how do you think it plays out that way?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Jeff, I think the best way to look at this is, don't look at this as binary. Competition comes in and just takes our share. We actually think that competition to a certain extent will less share because it'll give more legitimacy to clear aligners. And so, possibly in that lower segment of the marketplace could we lose some share? Sure. Sure, we could. At the same time we're expanding on the upper end with our product lines that you just saw with obviously mandibular advancement team, iGo in those areas.","Jeff, the other side of this too is it's we've been saying this for a long time, it's hard to do this. I mean treatment planning facilities, making sure that you can ship aligners and actually ship them in sequence. So first, second, third are really first, second, and third aligners. Putting a sales team out there that they really can walk through customers and hold their hand in sensor, but it takes time to do this. It's not \u2013 this is not like a patent cliff we've been saying all along with something is a you know a biosimilar and you can put it in your portfolio and sell it the next day it's not like that. It will take time to ramp your competition.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Now that makes sense and then one last question for me just iTero anything qualitatively you can talk about maybe scanner sales in the U.S. and are you seeing any traction outside of Invisalign cases with iTero on any kind of restorative procedures anything like that just kind of trying to get to what is the mindset of the U.S. dentist right now are they are they willing or are they at the point where they want to use scanners for things you know obviously for Invisalign but for other things as well just what your view there that would be helpful?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, if you look at \u2013 I mean if you look at the three shape in us right, I mean three shape has a good position with GPs in a sense of restorative workflow and with the labs and whatever and you know they've helped to from a GP standpoint to grow the marketplace. We're the same way. We have a good restorative scanner. We have a great scanner from overall Invisalign standpoint and in both of us kind of raised the awareness and capability out in the marketplace. So, you know honestly, when you look at this thing Jeff long-term, this is \u2013 you're going to have a scanner you know one way or another your workflow is going to be digital going forward in dentistry.","It starts around these kind of application restorative you know versus you know aligners and those kind of things. It'll flow through for the rest, so I don't know what you're thinking of in the sense of how to model that Jeff or what it means, but it just shows you more and more that this isn't just an for orthodontist. This is and we're developing a scanner that's brought across the marketplace to be one of the function well for GP and restorative, if you go back to iTero beginning right, it was","function well for a GP and restorative. If we go back to iTero's beginning right, it was restorative scanner. When we bought that business, we're primarily was in G you know the general dentistry segment that it was developed around. But so I think I reported that we had 2.5 million restoratives scans done on iTero. So when our team is out there are calling on a GP, we're talking about not just that you can do our liners with this, I'm confident you can do this is a great very accurate restorative scanner that can communicate very well with your dental lab, that's really important in that net workflow.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And scanner sales growing in the U.S. still, is there still a good market there for you guys on the scanner side?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","And no question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey. You saw the results of the iTero scanner business. You know the vast majority of the business is still in North America.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are set forth in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our first quarter 2019 conference call slides on our website, under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the first quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","Our first quarter was a very good start to the year with revenues, volumes, gross margin in EPS all above our guidance. Record Q1 revenues and Invisalign volumes were up 25.6% and 28.3% year-over-year respectively. Reflecting continued strong growth across all geographies and customer channels as well as strong iTero Scanner and Services revenues, which are up 55.1% year-over-year.","Q1 sequential growth was driven primarily by North America and EMEA volumes reflecting strength across the Invisalign product portfolio. We saw a nice uptick in adoption of Invisalign treatment with a record utilization overall as well as expansion of our customer base, which totaled 57,000 active doctors worldwide in Q1.","Now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, Q1 was a solid quarter with Invisalign case volume up 7.1% sequentially and 21.8% year-over-year reflecting growth in both our orthodontic and GP Dentists channel.","Q1 we trained 1,700 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region of which 1,400 were North American doctors. On a sequential basis Q1 Invisalign volume growth reflects record utilization for the Americas region overall driven by North American Orthros at 18.3 cases per doctor with good initial adoption with Invisalign mandibular advancement in North America driven by the mid-Q4 launch in the U.S. ","We also had solid performance from GP Dentists with continued momentum from Invisalign Lite, Invisalign Go. Invisalign Go provides a simple pathway for dentists to integrate mild to moderate tooth movement and to comprehensive care. And it makes it easy for GPs to refer out more complex cases to orthodontics in the network.","Year-over-year Q1 Invisalign volume growth in the Americas region was driven by continued strength in the Ortho channel, especially from our high volume doctors with 25.9% growth as well as an increase of 15.5% from the GP channel. In March, we announced the collaboration with Digital Smile Design or we call it DSD, a leader in holistic digital dentistry solutions for dental clinics, which features the Invisalign System and iTero element scanners as a digital solution of choice for tooth movement and scanning.","As part of the cooperation Align and DSD will deliver dedicated education programs, enable simplified, streamlined integration of digital end-to-end workflows into GP practices and offer doctors more opportunities to learn about digital tools and treatment planning support.","We also continue to make great progress in Latin America, led by Brazil. In Q1, Invisalign volume and Latin America was up significantly year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments as we continue to build our business in the region.","Training over 300 Invisalign doctors during the quarter. Next month I'll be in Brazil with the executive team hosting a major customer event with more than 200 doctors discussing the future of digital orthodontics including the science and technology behind both the Invisalign System as well as our iTero Scanners.","We\u2019ll also have local social media influences on hand as we kick off our very first Invisalign consumer campaign in Brazil and plan to live stream portions of the event to more than 500 doctors across the region. ","For our international business Q1 was another good quarter with strong Invisalign volume growth at 38.5% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. On a sequential basis international volume was up slightly reflecting strong growth in the EMEA region and offset somewhat by seasonally lower period in Asia Pacific as expected.","In Q1 we trained over 2,400 new Invisalign doctors internationally split roughly between each of the two regions. In EMEA Q1 was a strong quarter with volumes up 37.4% year-over-year driven by growth across the region with record Invisalign volumes in all but one country led by Iberia and France. We saw strength across the Invisalign product portfolio with continued momentum from Invisalign First and Invisalign Go.","We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by the Nordics and Benelux. For APAC, Q1 Invisalign volume increased 40.4% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong growth from nearly all country markets, led by China, Japan, and ANZ.","We also had a strong uptick in teenage patients in Q1, due in part to a teen promotion in China offered along with our Teen-edge sales program, intended to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment with teenagers. We also had strong growth from GP Dentists, which were up 63.5% year-over-year.","On a sequential basis, Q1 was flat as expected, due primarily to a seasonally slower period with the lunar New Year holiday. During Q1, we trained nearly 1,100 new doctors in APAC, over half of which were in China, and we opened our second state-of-the-art training facility in China, located in Shanghai.","Our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China is continuing to ramp, and while we are making good progress, we still expect it to take a couple of quarters to fully transition aligner fabrication from Juarez, Mexico to Ziyang, China to serve the Chinese market and expect manufacturing overhead in Ziyang to be underutilized during this transition period.","Overall for the teen market, in Q1 nearly 100,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 41.1% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions \u2013 especially in APAC and EMEA regions.","For Q1, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North Americas Orthodontists increased 29.2% and International doctors were up 67.2%. Invisalign First and Invisalign treatment with Mandibular Advancement continue to ramp globally and are helping to increase our share of teenagers and younger patients worldwide.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased to see that use of Invisalign treatment among teenagers continues to outpace adults and that Invisalign First is driving a really strong growth kid and tweens in the kid\/tween segment.","We\u2019ll continue to drive utilization and growth in our Americas\u2019 teen business this year with the first Invisalign Teen Summit in July. We know that Summits increase engagement and Invisalign adoption, so for the first time we\u2019re focusing a Summit program completely on teen treatment and teen culture, including a tie-in to 2019 VidCon, the top teen culture and community event.","Teen Summit is designed to turn low teen submitters into high teen submitters by combining Invisalign specific clinical and practice \"how tos\" with an immersive teen culture experience.","Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. We invest over $100 million each year in consumer marketing programs including TV, digital and social media, PR, event marketing and our Patient Concierge service.","Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. In Q1, we continued to see strong digital engagement with consumers reaching nearly 4 million unique visitors on Invisalign.com sites worldwide for a total of 53 million visitors to date.","Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q1 quarterly slides. In March, we launched a new online tool called SmileView at the International Dental Show IDS in Cologne, Germany.","SmileView is designed to help prospective Invisalign patients visualize a new, straighter smile before they opt for Invisalign treatment. Within 60 seconds of taking a smile selfie using the SmileView online tool with their smartphone or tablet, prospective patients can see what their new smile and straighter teeth may look like, with their own facial features.","SmileView is available on line, or in GP practices in beta testing in the UK and the U.S. and we are getting really positive feedback.","In North America, we continued to invest in strong digital plans for adults and teens. Our teen focused content developed by Awesomeness TV, the fastest growing youth channel and teen influencer program helps strengthen our brand presence among teens and parents, making Invisalign relevant and fun.","During South by Southwest, we reached adult consumers with an immersive experience with a RealSelf House and Modern Beauty, where consumers can learn more about Invisalign and see a simulation of their future smile using Invisalign SmileView technology.","And Invisalign was voted by consumers as a Most Worth It treatment, continuing to demonstrate continued strength of consumers. In EMEA, we held a recruitment drive for our Influencer Program called Invisalign Smile Squad generating over 100 plus new influencer applications and 350 plus doctor registrations to take part in the program. And our Parent of Teen campaign went live in UK and France \u2013 raising awareness amongst a new consumer audience.","Q2 will see the launch of our revised patient journey with media campaign strategy for focused markets, better integrating new conversion tools like SmileView and Concierge into the journey.","In APAC, we continued to build awareness for Invisalign treatment through use of paid media and our influencer campaign, including expansion of our influencer program in the region and a pilot Invisalign First social media campaign to target parents of younger children.","To leverage increasing consumer awareness and demand, we also began to expand the Invisalign Concierge program that connects interested consumers with Invisalign doctors for treatment into new countries.","Globally, in the second half of the year, we will launch a new consumer advertising campaign that emphasizes the importance of doctor led treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, while also differentiating our brand.","On the professional marketing side, we recently launched two dedicated professional Invisalign brand campaigns that feature Orthodontists and GP Dentists. The Ortho as Hero campaign focuses on Invisalign orthodontists as critical leaders and the heroes of transformative, life-changing smiles, especially for teen and younger patients. The campaign showcases modern orthodontics practices that leverage digital approaches to treatment and are warm and inviting.","The Go Beyond campaign is designed to celebrate dentists who go above and beyond every day to serve their patients. It also demonstrates the relevance of tooth movement to General Dentists and the importance of integrating Invisalign within comprehensive dentistry. This was launched in North America, and is now being rolled out in the EMEA and APAC regions.","For iTero scanner and services business, iTero revenues increased 55.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength growth across all geographies and customer channels. On a sequential basis, revenues were down 9.8% sequentially, as expected, reflecting lower scanner sales following a strong Q4 and consistent with the seasonality in the capital equipment business partially offset by continued growth in services revenues due to the increasing install base.","During the quarter, we launched the new iTero Element 5D Imaging System for comprehensive preventative and restorative oral care at the International Dental Show. The iTero Element 5D scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D, intra-oral color and NIRI images or near-infrared images and enables comparison over time using iTero TimeLapse.","Integrated 3D, intra-oral color and NIRI technology of the new iTero 5D Imaging System aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation. The iTero Element 5D scanner is available for sale in the majority of European and APAC countries, and is not yet available in the United States or Latin America.","Cumulatively, 13.5 million orthodontic scans and 3.6 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q1, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 76% from 67.3%. In Q1 last year, international scans increased to 59.3% up from 43.5% in the same quarter last year.","Within the Americas, 91.2% of cases submitted by North American Orthos were submitted digitally. And China remains at 45% for the quarter. We continue to anticipate that in another year or two, nearly all Invisalign cases will be submitted digitally \u2013 primarily through an iTero scanner.","Given our continued progress and increased use of digital scans for Invisalign case submission, we continue to get questions regarding interoperability with other third-party scanners. With recent product introductions, we want to make sure we are clear about which scanners are not qualified to submit Invisalign case submissions. We developed an interoperability matrix that has been distributed to our sales and customer facing teams to help inform doctors. It also included our Q1 2019 conference call slides. So please reference it for more detail.","However, to ensure there is no confusion in the marketplace then I quickly reiterate our interoperability position on this call with two new scanners, the Trios 4 and Primescan. Regarding the Trios 4, Align will not qualify Trios 4, or any future 3Shape scanner product, for Invisalign interoperability in the U.S. or globally.","Regarding Primescan, Align has received a request from Dentsply\/Sirona to evaluate Primescan for Invisalign case submissions and we are considering that request. Until we make a decision to move forward and can conduct testing, Primescan is not qualified for Invisalign case submissions.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on two other important topics. Our plans to reorganize Align\u2019s corporate entity structure to better align with the growing international nature of our business, and the recent settlement agreement with Straumann.","First, our plans to reorganize our corporate entity structure: Given the rapid expansion of our business globally, we must continue to scale and optimize our operations to help support our growth and financial profile.","In March, we announced internally that we would be making changes to our EMEA headquarters located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Specifically, we will relocate our current EMEA Headquarters and move the majority of our corporate functions: Finance, IT, HR, Legal, and Regional EMEA Marketing from Amsterdam to Switzerland. We will begin the transition to the new headquarter location mid-year and expect to complete it in 2020 early. We will maintain an Amsterdam office to support local commercial operations.","In addition, in August we will be relocating our current Order Acquisition or OA facility from Amsterdam to Poland to create a centralized operational hub for EMEA co-located with our new Treatment Planning facility that we just opened. This new hub in Poland will include iTero business operations, customer success and clinical support teams, and IT operations.","As we evaluated our options, relocating our EMEA headquarters to Switzerland quickly became our top choice on many factors including: a more favorable and stable operating environment. An opportunity to accelerate our transition to a more decentralized commercial structure for EMEA that reflects the localization we\u2019ve been working toward. A more centralized geographic location in Europe within EMEA\u2019s largest potential market.","An available talent pool to support key strategic roles required in the new EMEA headquarters. While we expect these proposed changes will allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies, it was a difficult decision to make and we are committed to supporting our impacted employees throughout this transition.","Moving onto the settlement agreement with Straumann. On March 28, we announced a settlement with the Straumann Group to settle patent disputes with ClearCorrect, who was purchased by Straumann in 2017. As many of you know, for years Align has been engaged in complicated, multi-country, multi-court patent litigation with ClearCorrect. The settlement with Straumann ends all current and pending litigation and provides $35 million in settlement fees to Align.","In addition, we have signed a non-binding letter of intent, LOI with Straumann for an iTero development and distribution agreement. If we reach an agreement, Straumann will purchase and distribute 5,000 iTero scanners over the next five years and co-fund development with us to integrate Straumann\u2019s digital workflow into those scanners.","The letter of intent we\u2019ve signed is non-binding, which means either one of us can walk away from the LOI. However, if we don\u2019t reach a development and distribution agreement with Straumann by early July, Straumann will pay us an additional $16 million, for a total of $51 million.","We have always been passionate about defending our intellectual property and the hard work and innovation by the Align team that it represents. We\u2019ll continue to do that and to protect our technology through all the ways that our legal system provides.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Morici","Thanks Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $549 million, up 2.8% from the prior quarter and up 25.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes $16.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.","For Clear aligners, Q1 revenue of $469.2 million was up 5.3% sequentially on strong Invisalign volume from North America and EMEA, and higher than expected Invisalign ASPs. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 21.7% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies.","Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $10 to $1,245 reflecting favorable impacts from FX and product mix shift, partially offset by higher promotions. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were down $65 primarily reflecting promotional discounts, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases in July 2018.","Total Q1 Invisalign shipments of 349,000.2 cases were up 4.6% sequentially and up 28.3% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 9.5% sequentially and up 25.9% year-over-year.","For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 3.5% sequentially and up 15.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 1.3% sequentially and up 38.5% year-over-year.","Our Scanner and Services revenue for the first quarter was $79.8 million, down 9.8% sequentially due to seasonality as Q4 is typically stronger due to end of the year capital equipment purchases. Year-over-year revenue was up 55.1%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions and related service revenues.","Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 1.5 points sequentially and down 1.7 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 74.9%, up 0.8 points sequentially primarily due to improved manufacturing leverage, approximately $4 million of one-time benefits related to freight refunds and rebates, and seasonally lower training costs, partially offset by higher number of aligners per case.","Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.1 points year-over-year primarily due to higher number of aligners per case, lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing leverage, and one-time benefits related to freight refunds and rebates as described above, along with lower doctor training costs.","Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 63.6%, up 3.7 points sequentially and up 4.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and one-time benefits related to freight refunds along with manufacturing efficiencies.","Q1 operating expenses were $314.4 million, up sequentially 19.7% and up 37.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in sales and R&D activities, along with higher legal\/consulting expenses, as well as increased compensation related expenses due to higher headcount and our planned annual increase in employee compensation programs, partially offset by seasonally lower advertising spending. Additionally, our Q1 operating expenses include impairments and other charges related to Invisalign Store closures of $29.8 million.","Our first quarter operating income was $87.7 million, down 27.2% sequentially and down 10.7% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income is primarily attributed to higher operating expenses offset in part by higher gross profit. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating income primarily reflects higher operating expenses commensurate from growth, which includes charges related to our Invisalign Store closures.","Our first quarter operating margin was 16%, down 6.6 points sequentially and down 6.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to higher operating expenses and the Invisalign Store closure costs, partially offset by higher gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to higher operating expenses and Invisalign Store closure costs and lower gross margin. The Q1 operating margin impact from the store closures was approximately 540 basis points.","With regards to first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 10.4% which includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation from restricted stock vesting during the quarter and approximately $8 million of discrete tax benefit related to the tax impact on the Invisalign Store closure costs. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.89, down $0.31 sequentially and down $0.28 compared to the prior year. Invisalign Store related closure costs, net of tax, impacted Q1 diluted EPS by approximately $0.28.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31st, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments were $732.5 million, a decrease of $11.9 million from the prior quarter which is primarily from $50 million used to repurchase approximately 205,000 shares of our stock. Of the $732.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $372.6 million was held in the US and $359.9 million was held by our International entities.","Q1 accounts receivable balance was $479.3 million, up approximately 9.2% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 78 days, up four days sequentially and up four days from Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $117.2 million, up $39.9 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $35.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $81.9 million.","During Q1, we've purchased on the open market approximately 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $243.42 per share, including commission for an aggregate purchase price of approximately of $50 million. We have $450 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 Repurchase Program. Also, during the first quarter, we adopted the new lease standard and now record operating leases \u2013 lease assets and related liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, however, there was no significant impact to our operating results.","With that, let's turn to our Q\/Q outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For International, we expect Q2 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting seasonally stronger periods for both EMEA and APAC regions. For the Americas, we expect Q2 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting growth across all key markets, as well as a seasonally stronger period for North America orthodontists with the beginning of the summer teen season. We expect our iTero business to be up sequentially coming off of a slower period for capital equipment in Q1.","And, regarding Smile Direct Club, we expect almost no clear aligner volume from SDC in Q2. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 380,000 to 385,000 cases, up approximately 26% to 27% year-over-year. We expect Q2 revenues to be in the range of $590 million to $600 million, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue outlook assumes almost no SDC volume compared to the same quarter a year ago, when aligners supplied to SDC contributed $8.6 million to revenue.","We expect Q2 gross margin to be in the range of 71.5% to 72.5%. Q2 gross margin is sequentially lower than Q1 due to the one-time benefits of approximately 1% realized in Q1 that we do not expect to repeat. We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $277 million to $282 million, which includes a one-time benefit of approximately $30 million from our Straumann settlement gain, net of our estimated costs for the iTero development agreement. Q2 operating expenses reflect continued investments in sales, marketing and R&D including increased consumer media\/advertising spend, as well as higher legal fees and costs related to our corporate structure reorganization announced last quarter.","Q2 operating margin should be in a range of 24.5% to 25.4%, which includes the expected benefit from the Straumann settlement gain mentioned above and approximately 2% negative impact to operating margin due to higher legal fees and costs related to our corporate structure reorganization. Note, as we described on our Q4 earnings call in January, we expect the impact from higher legal and corporate structure reorganization costs to be about 1.5% to 2% for the full year.","Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately 80.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.47 to $1.54. Q2 diluted EPS guidance includes $0.28 gain from the Straumann settlement and $0.10 gain from the SDC equity settlement, net of the income tax effects, and approximately $0.09 expense related to the corporate structure reorganization costs and higher legal\/litigation costs. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $85 million to $90 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $20 million to $22 million.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joe Hogan","Thanks John. Overall Q1 was another solid quarter and I'm pleased with the continued progress we're making and executing on our strategic growth drivers and I'm excited about the opportunity we have. Just want to highlight those four growth drivers here for the quarter. From an international expansion standpoint Invisalign volume was up 38.5%. On our Ortho\/Teen Utilization our worldwide Invisalign Teen patients growth was over 41%.","GP Treat and Refer, leading with iTero scanners, our worldwide GP volumes for Invisalign were up 27.3% and 15.5% for GPs in the Americas. And iTero scanner revenues were up 55.1%. Consumer and patient conversion with Invisalign treatment, we engaged with 4 million consumers globally in Q1 and are building the most recognized orthodontic brand in the industry.","In Q2, we have a number of exciting programs and initiatives heading into the summer season kicking off with the AAO in early May, and the Invisalign Symposium on the Digital Practice in London, which is our first ever truly global event and designed to foster a global community of Invisalign doctors. The symposium will bring together 300 of the most experienced and most high volume Invisalign orthodontists from across the world to discuss the digital orthodontics and the challenges and opportunities digital transformation provides their practices.","Finally, before I open the call up for questions, I want to take a minute to welcome Raj Pudipeddi who joined Align last month as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, CMO, reporting to me. Raj joins us with more than 24 years of business leadership experience and brand building experience for companies including Procter & Gamble and Bharti Airtel, an Indian telecom leader. He has an outstanding track record of delivering results across the North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Raj also brings great consumer acumen and marketing expertise in terms of building brands, launching new products and accelerating digital businesses globally. His knowledge and understanding of how to leverage big data and consumer personalization will be instrumental as we continue to lead the transformation of digital orthodontics and dentistry and help millions of consumers get a smile they love with Invisalign doctors. Raj is a strong addition to our leadership team and I am","thrilled to have him on board.","With that, I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. We\u2019ll see many of you at the American Association of Orthodontist Meeting in Los Angeles next month, as well as the upcoming financial conferences including BankAmerica Merrill Lynch, Northcoast, Stifel, Goldman Sachs and William Blair.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erin Wright With Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Erin?","Shirley Stacy","Hi, Erin, are you there?","Operator","Please check as if your line is mute.","Erin Wright","Apologies. Can you hear me now?","Operator","Yes.","Shirley Stacy","Hi, Erin.","Joe Hogan","Hi, Erin.","Erin Wright","Hi. So on the gross margin, how should we be thinking about the run rate for the remainder of the year? I understand there was an onetime factors in freight refunds, rebates. Are there other moving parts we should be thinking about in the second quarter from a gross margin perspective? And more broadly, can you characterize how we should be thinking about that longer-term leverage to that metric over the next few years? Thanks.","John Morici","Hi, Erin, this is John. Yes, what we saw \u2013 in Q1, we saw good improvement in our gross margin, we talked about 4 million of some of the unusual, you strip that out. What we expect as we go forward in our Q2 guidance is that progression, we're going to continue to improve our gross margin, some of that comes to some of the operational efficiencies in China and other places that we'll see as the year progresses.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then can you speak to some of the incremental cost and opportunities associated with this reorganization of your corporate entity structure? Are there incremental costs there from what you said in the fourth quarter? And what are those longer-term financial efficiencies that this can generate from a tax perspective or from an operational perspective as well?","John Morici","Yeah, Erin, this is John again. So no additional than what we had talked about. We laid out from a reorganization standpoint about 1% in total for the year. And that'll really progress with Q2 on, but really what we see is a more agile organization and one, that can accommodate changes to any global changes that might come up around taxes or anything else. So that's really the benefits that we have. EMEA is growing so much as centralized as that location, but it also gives us an operating structure that we can use in the future.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Hogan","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon guys, can you hear me okay? Hey Joe, how are you?","Joe Hogan","Great.","Jeff Johnson","Let me start with you and then \u2013 Hey, all. So let me start with you, Joe, and then I have a question for John as well on the margin front. But Joe, with the store shut down here in April, I guess, what are you seeing impact wise on volumes maybe in the near-term, whether that's 2Q or over the next couple quarters? And then how might that impact how you allocate some expenses this year? Is there some way you can reallocate those expenses into other kind of growth initiatives, whether that's with DSO or other private docs or what have you?","Joe Hogan","Hey Jeff, first of all, I mean I think we \u2013 when we announced this issue with SDC having to close the stores, they just said it wasn't going to be material from a revenue standpoint and what we \u2013 for the year and so we're sticking with that overall. I mean, obviously there'll be some case loss from a store standpoint.","The other part of your question is we shift some of that spend back into advertising back into other activities that we have going on to help to drive that demand. So we are \u2013 we will reallocate that expense, it's reallocated into marketing and sales and be able to do that. And we expect to have good results from that too. We have I think good experience and understanding what that investment return rate is.","Jeff Johnson","All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then John on the margin front, I mean if I exclude some of the onetime costs in the 1Q, it seems like your operating margin probably would have beaten by maybe 500 basis points or so relative to your guidance. And then if I take into account the gains in 2Q, it seems like margins are going to be down 400 basis points, 500 basis points year-over-year, and the 2Q, which is kind of worse than we were thinking.","So I guess I'm just trying to get my arms around kind of volatility around margins. Is there more volatility x the noise in the base business going on right now? Is there just conservatism in your base business guidance for 2Q? How should we think about kind of recent and future margin trends?","John Morici","Yes, so from a \u2013 you\u2019re talking about specific gross margin, when you look at that, we're seeing good improvement from some of the manufacturing efficiencies and things that happened in the first quarter. We expect that to continue, we saw ASPs up $10 in Q1, which helps contribute to that. But this is about being able to continue to leverage the manufacturing and the other operations that we have. And that should continue to get better as the year progresses. And so that's similar to what we talked about at the end of Q4 as well. This is something that we \u2013 we\u2019ll get those efficiencies as the year progresses.","Jeff Johnson","Well, let me just clarify, I guess that question and focus just on the first quarter x the charges in the 1Q, it seems like your margin probably beat even at the operating line by almost 500 basis points relative to your guidance because I think your guidance did not anticipate these onetime store closure costs in that. So what drove that upside and how did you get the 500 basis points of upside in the quarter?","John Morici","Yes. So really when we saw, as we looked through it Jeff, we saw like I said some improvement on the gross margin standpoint, some of the OpEx leverage that we are able to achieve in the first quarter as well and that started our year in a very strong position from an operating margin standpoint. And then as we go through the year as we've talked about, there'll be some litigation and some reorganization costs that we've been calling out, as we go through. But it was really a strong start to the year from a gross margin standpoint and then managing the op-Expenditures and we saw that leverage really show up in Q1.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Joe Hogan","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Jon.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys, good afternoon. I'm also going to ask a margin related question, and then on pivot. But just John big normalized EPS be it for 1Q, obviously there's been sort of no shortage of news flow over the past couple of months. So I just wanted to check in, I'm going to drill down or make sure that I'm clear on the op margins. In other words, if I were to check it on the 2H 2019 op margin, should I get back to the 25% to 30% OM range, that you will alluded to last quarter? That's sort of part A of number one.","And then part B would be, your 2Q revenue guidance, the revs are slightly ahead with the cases of smidge below. So do we assume a sort of flattish 1Q to 2Q ASP? And then I'll ask my second one.","John Morici","Okay. Yes, from an op margin standpoint and what we tried to do is lay that out a little bit in the slides for you, Jon, but when we look at as we've reported on a gap basis, just talk to the high guide of 25.4% from a guidance standpoint. And we're staying within there because that's GAAP, within there is a Straumann settlement of approximately 5 points. And then we have some of the corporate structure and reorganization costs, as well as the legal cost. And you back out or add back a couple of points to that. So that gets you to 22.5% or so from an op margin standpoint in Q2 on an operational basis.","Jon Block","John, I'm sure if I could jump in there really quick. I didn't mean 2Q, I meant 2H, last quarter you talked about 2H 2019 op margins falling back in your long-term guidance range of 25% to 30%, here we are today. Do you still have high conviction in 2H 2019 the op margins are 25% to 30%.","John Morici","Yes, sorry, Jon, yes. In the second half the conviction that we have and what we expect to have in the second half is consistent, it's the 25% range in the second half of the year.","Jon Block","Okay. And then the implied ASPs for 2Q flattish with 1Q, is that the quick ballpark demand?","John Morici","That \u2013 there is a little bit of FX from 1Q to Q2, but essentially flat.","Jon Block","Okay, great. And then for 1Q 2019, Simon EMEA growth rate is now within 300 bips relative to Julie's, which I view as a good thing from a diversification standpoint and congrats to Simon, who I know has been chasing Julie for several years. But I'm just curious how we should think about that going forward, especially with the scanner that's technically newer in China. And Joe, you talked about the teen opportunity in China. Do we think that, call it closer to parity Joe is here to stay? Or is there anything unique in one market or the other, teen I go scanner that can cause APAC to sort of separate again. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Jon, I think first of all you've got to take cyclicality into \u2013 in fact when you look at China and APAC versus EMEA, EMEA goes around the dark side of the moon right after the second quarter, China has really strong third quarter like they always do, get to Lunar New Year in the fourth quarter, you got a stronger EMEA in the first quarter. So I think you can't do this kind of an apples-to-oranges comparison when you look at what Simon did this quarter.","So what I would take away from this one is you got a continuing growth rate in EMEA and continuing penetration rates there that are terrific. We still have a great business in APAC from a growth standpoint overall. So I love the competition between those two. I'm cheering for them both, Jon.","Jon Block","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Nathan Rich","Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this evening. Maybe just going back to ASPs, it looks like you saw a pretty nice step up sequentially in the quarter mostly on the international side. Could you maybe just talk about what came in better than expectations in the quarter? And then you kind of talked about the 2Q guidance for ASPs to be flat, but it does seem like you're seeing some nice progression there relative to your kind of full year guidance for ASPs to be flat to 4Q of last year. So how should we think about the progression of ASPs going forward over the balance of the year?","John Morici","Hey Nate, this is John. Similar to what we've said in the past where we see better comprehensive cases like we saw I think compared to what we had expected, driven by mandibular advancement and other products that we have, that was in the teen growth that we saw, the 41%. That all contributes to higher ASP that showed up in Q1. And when we think about \u2013 as we're looking forward, take FX out of that, we think that the \u2013 it's pretty balanced. We'll have that \u2013 overall, we'll have a good international growth, we have that growth in the comprehensive cases with teens, but then we have the low stage mix shift that we see, where the low stage is growing faster than our comprehensive cases. But in balance, we think it's \u2013 it balances out.","Nathan Rich","Okay. That makes sense. And then, Joe, maybe one for you. The ortho utilization in the quarter was very impressive. Can you maybe just talk to kind of what's resonating in the market and where you think this could go? It seems like you should still have a lot of traction with some of the recent launches, like MA and the marketing initiatives that you guys talked about. So just curious to get your thoughts on where you think this could ultimately end up?","Joe Hogan","Nathan, overall, when you look at what's going on, I'd say there's two prime drivers in that ortho segment. One is what you mentioned is you have our MAF product now that was qualified in November of last year, you have our Invisalign teen product, which we're doing a lot of cases, seven-year old patients, eight-year old patients that we really never touched before. So that's obviously a big driver from an increased utilization standpoint.","Secondly, I think it's just increasing awareness of the preference of consumers for clear aligners and I think orthodontists know that and we see more and more orthodontists really adopting that. Thirdly, when you think about the segment overall is \u2013 from a long-term standpoint, like we talk about, that's our second strategic imperative, is we see a lot of runway in teens. And that's why we're having our Teen Summit coming up this year, we'll have a lot of focus on our top 300 in London this year also on teens and we see more and more uptake on that as we work with orthos on the teens and we go directly to consumers and parents about it.","Nathan Rich","Great, thank you.","Shirley Stacy","Nate, thanks. Next question, please.","Joe Hogan","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks and good evening. Joe, I just want to follow up on the previous sort of ASP question because I almost look out a little bit differently, right. I mean, you clearly had a decent uptick on an international basis and your worldwide ASP was up slightly. Does that kind of imply that North America might have been flat or even maybe down? And I know there's a lot of moving parts and I think, John, you talked about some of those like mix and promotional discounts and FX.","Could you just peel back the onion a little bit on North American ASPs and give us a sense because I think it's important, given the market's focus on the competitive landscape? So just give us a sense for what's going on there.","Joe Hogan","Yes. Glen, when we look at the ASPs, totally like you said, up about $10 on a worldwide basis. In North America, slightly down from Q4, but from a standpoint of \u2013 really coming from a mix standpoint, it's just a matter of how and what type of cases the doctors are taking on, whether it's more comprehensive or some of the low-stage. And remember from a low-stage standpoint, those are some of our highest margin rate products. So when we look at that in total, we'll go to where the volume is and what makes sense for our business.","Glen Santangelo","Maybe I'll just ask one follow-up question on your utilization. Within North American orthodontists, you saw a healthy sequential uptick in the number of cases, maybe \u2013 any idea what drove that and maybe could you give us a better sense for where maybe market penetration stands now for clear tray aligner and maybe what your market share numbers might look like to give us a sense for how much runway there maybe to go?","Joe Hogan","Hey, Glen. It's Joe. On the utilization for orthos, think about two big vectors there, it's just our product line in teens, MAF and our Invisalign First product line. It really brings us into, what is about 25% to 30% of the teen market that we couldn't access before, before we had those products. Overall, I just think we have good momentum in that sense and we're going to continue to see continued increase in utilization as more and more doctors gain confidence in those products.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Glen. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ravi Misra","Hi, thank you for taking the questions. So I guess, just following up on that, Joe. Can we just talk a little bit about how the Invisalign First and mandibular advancement are contributing to that growth rate in that kind of teen, the strong teen growth number that you put there? And a little bit related, can you maybe touch upon what you're seeing out there with the competition and how your strategy is evolving now that the store closure has become underway? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","First of all, Ravi, I'll just say, again, the utilization rates that you referenced and all and for teens, again, it's new product. We feel we're still having underutilization in teens. I mean, we're still in the United States, 9%, 10% from a teen standpoint. I'd say from a clinical standpoint, we can handle 80% to 90% of those cases, depending on how you want to rate them. Many of our Invisalign docs say they can do anything in teen than they can in Invisalign. So we have a long way to go from a growth standpoint.","From a competitive standpoint, we really have no competitors in those kind of products. Okay, those are highly proprietary products that \u2013 it just take a lot of history and knowledge to be able to make them and have them function well in the marketplace. As far as how we're competing out there with Invisalign stores or whatever, look, Invisalign stores or what they always have been was how do you drive more demand for our product line, it was way instead of \u2013 we've been advertising consumers for years. This was a way of just taking those advertisement kind of capabilities and bring them in the store and exciting patients, moving those patients to doctors. It was nothing different in our business model.","I mean, it's a shame in the sense of what the arbitrator ruled, but look, we respect that decision and we'll move on in the sense of continuing to generate demand the way we know how to generate demand. From a competitive standpoint, SDC is a different kind of competitor. Obviously, they have high growth rates, we have high growth rates too, we show we can mutually co-exist in the marketplace and we continue to both grow.","Ravi Misra","Great, thanks.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Ravi. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed.","Joe Hogan","Hey, John.","John Kreger","Hey, how are you?","Joe Hogan","Good.","John Kreger","So I'd like to go back to China. Can you just talk about the next steps there? What do you have to do to continue growing as quickly as you have? We noticed that the number of doctors trained in APAC and China declined a little bit compared to where it was at the end of 2018. Is that in any way related to the slowing economic outlook in your opinion or is that seasonality? And can you just talk about how you expect the competitive dynamics in China to change, now that Straumann is making an entrance via a partnership there?","Joe Hogan","Hey. Look, it's \u2013 you're back to Joe here. Look, China is great growth market for us, we have \u2013 we're manufacturing in China now. We've put treatment planning in Chengdu. We handle all of our Chinese doctors right now out of China itself. We have two wonderful training centers, one in Shanghai, one in Chengdu. We feel very capable in China, we lead in China. Straumann's move with a third or fourth tier player from a clear aligner standpoint, I don't see that as a dramatic effect on this market now or in the immediate future at all.","John Kreger","Okay, great. And then just one quick clarifying question on operating margin. So if you strip out the one-time gains and losses that you've discussed, does your full year outlook that you discussed a quarter ago for operating margin that's below the long-term outlook, does that still hold?","John Morici","Yes. Yes, it does.","John Kreger","Okay, thank you.","Joe Hogan","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good afternoon. Joe, two part question on the scanner business. First, would like to get your perspective on how you sort of see the competitive landscape developing, number of new launches, all the ideas? And do you anticipate any stepped up level in just noise or evaluations as customers kind of digest these new intros?","And then secondly, could you give us a sense of the relative growth rates in the scanner business between O-U.S. and North America? And then I guess, thirdly, any help you can give us in terms of the expected timing of the U.S. approval for the new iTero 5D?","Joe Hogan","Starting with your broader question on the scanner business is \u2013 look, we feel really good about our scanner. I mean, 5D leads, I mean, obviously, you see the 3Shape product came out, but you got two separate scans that kind of use the near-infrared. And I mean, we're so focused on workflow of GPs, we just known over the years that, goodness, GP's time is such an important commodity in that sense and you want to do things as fast as you possibly can.","So combining the near-infrared together for caries detection and tooth cracking together with just a normal digital scan is a big breakthrough for us in the industry. And we've gotten great feedback. Obviously, they're starting off well. From a standpoint of U.S. approval, it's the FDA. Right. I won't talk too much about it, but there are some issues in the sense of how the FDA wants this one to be designed from a disease control standpoint.","But we have a good vector on what needs to be done, it's going to take a little bit longer, just like our MAF product did, but we're confident. And I would say late fourth quarter early first quarter next year, we'll be able to get approval.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And a couple for John, housekeeping items. First, could you quantify the impact of the China facility on gross margins in the first quarter? Secondly, were there any legal or corporate expense or corporate reorg expenses absorbed in the first quarter? And then lastly, the $0.10 SDC equity gain in 2Q, just confirm, is that below the line?","John Morici","Well, I can answer that one first. Yes, that's below the line. That's the equity gain that we will have. And then the corporate restructuring costs, very small amount in Q1, it really started in Q2 and handles the rest of the rest of the year. And then in terms of the China gross margin or the impact on costs, I mean, we saw higher utilization in those plants, drives efficiencies and we see that come through to our bottom line. So as we described earlier, it starts in Q1 and it progresses through the year.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Brandon. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the feedback that you guys have received on the doctor-owned experience centers, now they're sort of switching over more to that strategy?","JoeHogan","Elizabeth, it\u2019s Joe. We have about two of those out there right now. Feedback is good. I mean, we've had Invisalign stores out there for years, basically, and these are ones just dedicated Invisalign stores with brand and all. And feedback has been terrific, uptick has been good. So overall, it's a good place for us to invest.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay. And if you, the new plan for sort of that growth going forward there, you don't anticipate sort of any major changes versus what you've been sort of seeing recently with those?","Joe Hogan","No, I think we'll just \u2013 we will continue with the pace that we've been going and there's a lot of interest out there. We're just working through it right now. But overall, the interest from an orthodontic standpoint has been extremely good and also from the GP practices.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed.","Steven Valiquette","Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. So I just have a question here around the Straumann settlement. The $35 million initial payment, I mean, that seems pretty straightforward. But for the extra non-binding part of the agreement, seems like the potential for Straumann to sell 5,000 extra iTero scanners would be much more positive for Align versus just receiving an extra $16 million from them.","So I guess the questions are, first, do you agree or disagree with that? But then also, secondarily, just from the Straumann perspective, what would be the incentives for them to sell iTero instead of just paying you the $16 million? So just curious to get more color around this. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Well hey, Steve, it's Joe. First of all when you look at Straumann, they have their own internal scanner, but it really doesn't fit the broad application base that you need for both clear aligners and also for the restorative aspect of GP. So they primarily use 3Shape for those kind of scans today.","So your comment about which is better, the $60 million or this. It's a good question. I mean, you have to assume with the 5,000 that they would sell will be 5,000 we can't sell. And, I mean, that's not necessarily true or a discrete variable in this whole equation. So, look, ideally, I think having the scanner sold by Straumann and having a good restorative workflow together would be helpful. But I wouldn't, it's not a live or die proposition. I feel we have good distribution in the marketplace. We have good coverage in three different regions and we'll be able to function well in either scenario.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Kevin Farshchi","Thanks for squeezing me in. This is Kevin on for Matt today. First one just quickly on iTero. Assume the seasonality in Q1, likely the low watermark there and assume the outlook for the sequential increase in Q2 that you provided, but can you put any numbers or a trend around the iTero growth for the second half of the year? The comps there are obviously difficult, but I assume you have a bigger specialized sales force just on that and then you're lapping some DSO partnerships.","John Morici","Yeah. Kevin, this is John. So good growth in Q1. What we expect is to be able to continue to, globally, be able to have more and more iTeros sold. We think it's a great scanner, new 5D and so on really contributes to that growth. But we've seen good growth so far. Really no change in what \u2013 in how we think about it for the total year, but it's going to continue to expand and work through as many doctors as possible.","Kevin Farshchi","Okay, sounds great. If I could squeeze one more in for Joe. It seems like the initiatives in Brazil are continuing to ramp up with those 3,000 docs trained and you've obviously been highly under index there historically as a percentage of Americas, despite it being a big market. Can you frame up that opportunity a little bit and talk about the type of revenue contribution you can get this year and in the coming years from that region? Is it upside to the plan? How do you think about that region? Thank you.","Joe Hogan","Well, I mean, I think it's in our plan for 2019 is already baked in there from a Brazil and Latin America standpoint. I could tell by your question, you do recognize the opportunity that we have in Latin America and also Brazil, given the focus on orthodontics in both of those regions. And look, your comment also, we were late to the game there.","And that's why you see us making significant investments now in the sense of training doctors, putting people in place and building infrastructure there. So, we haven't broken out those numbers yet. When they really become material to the business, we will do that. But right now, we're not making any projections or specifics about it. But rest assured, as you know, this is a big opportunity for us, it's a good product at the right time and we feel we have good leadership there and good momentum.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks very much. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Michael Ryskin","Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just two real quick ones. One on the mandibular advancement, it's been a few months now since it's been out in the States. And you mentioned that you saw a positive adoption response in 1Q. Could you go a little bit deeper? Did it show up materially in the numbers? Do you think it contributed and sort of how does it feel going into the ramp for the rest of the year?","John Morici","Hey, Mike. This is John. It certainly helps. It's a slow adoption. I mean, these are doctors that they just started trying some of these cases, they want to see and experience it for themselves to be able to see that it works in the way they want. So it's a slow rollout and adoption, but it gets that some of the key parts of our business that we want to grow, which is teen.","Michael Ryskin","Got it. I was just trying to get if that contributed to the North American ortho boost in the quarter. And then a quick follow on. The China fabrication facility you mentioned is still being underutilized, continues to ramp. Any thoughts for when you think you could hit full ramp or close to it? Is it later this year? Is it early 2020 just to give us a sense for how that moves through?","John Morici","Yes, Mike. This is John again. So we will see a progression and we saw a good improvement in Q1 and it will continue to improve as you utilize that facility more and more, but that will take the rest of this year.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks, Mike. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed.","Jaime Morgan","Hi, this is Jaime on for Rich. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to circle back on competition. I know some of your competitors have recently launched more price favorable lines geared towards the GP channel. So I was wondering, if you're seeing \u2013 or running a little bit more in that channel? And then also just kind of a sense of the ortho channel as well as you're now several quarters into seeing some competition. Thanks.","Joe Hogan","Hey, Jaime, it's Joe. Just a quick question for you, would you tell me who that competitor is with the price favorable lines of GP?","Jaime Morgan","I believe Henry Schein had been \u2013 they had launched a new product, geared...","Joe Hogan","Yes. We haven't really seen Schein, felt Schein in the marketplace at all. And we don't even know what their pricing is frankly. And so we really haven't had to respond to that piece. I think if you look at the marketplace, you'd say that ClearCorrect traditionally has been in that GP segment. They're obviously owned by Straumann now.","Straumann has been taking them throughout that channel. But we really haven't felt a higher degree of competitive pressure since it is a piece either. So I just find your question interesting. I know there's a lot of speculation out there right now, but we don't necessarily feel that. ","And remember, ClearCorrect always had a price favorable line from a GP standpoint. And we're basically being able to fight that with technology and coverage in the marketplace.","Shirley Stacy","Thanks for your question. We'll take one last question, operator.","Operator","Our last question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS Investment Bank. Please proceed.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, thanks for taking one last question. Appreciate it. Just any color around the doctors trained in the quarter? Noticed a sequential decline. There's always some seasonality to this, but just the number of docs trained was pretty meaningfully lower both O-US and in the Americas. Just any color around that.","John Morici","Hey Kevin, this is John. From a doctor's standpoint, Q1 is typically lower from a training standpoint. So things build as you go through the year and we saw that from Q4 to Q1, but nothing more. We want to work with doctors that want to come with cases and really get into being able to use more and more Invisalign. So, some of it's just the timing of making that all happen, but nothing more than that.","Kevin Caliendo","Great, thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Shirley Stacy","Well, thank you, everyone.

Ken will cover these circumstances and a discussion of our preliminary Q3 financial results as well as outlook for Q4 in more detail. I\u2019ll come back with a few closing comment and open up the call to questions.","Q3 revenue of 136.5 million increased 8.4% year-over-year and yet decreased 6.3% sequentially. Despite a strong summer season for Invisalign teenager cases, which increased 21% sequentially and year-over-year, our third quarter revenue was slightly lower than our outlook.","Q3 is historically a slower period for North American GP dentists who have fewer days in office due to vacations as well as for International doctors who typically take extended summer holidays, especially in southern Europe.","This year summer seasonality was more pronounced in North America and as a result, we did not see the expected ramp in Invisalign cases for GPs and Orthodontists. This softness has continued through October and is reflected in our Q4 guidance, which despite that slowdown, still projects a healthy annual growth rate for the company overall, with volume growth of at least 16%.","We\u2019re taking a complete look at our results, including demand for our products and analyzing the industry and the markets in which we operate. We are evaluating a lot of data, much of which is conflicting, and none of which supports a fundamental decrease in demand for Invisalign.","On the one hand, data such as the surprisingly strong, recent consumer sentiment ratings, as well as the uptick in visitors to Invisalign.com, and Find A Doctor searches point to continued strong consumer interest. On the other hand, additional insight from our customers regarding Invisalign in their practices indicate that more adult patients were delaying or pushing out acceptance of their ClinCheck treatment plans this summer and early fall, possibly due to concerns about the economy.","Several recent analyst reports based on AFG Research suggest that conditions within the dental space during the calendar third quarter were slightly less desirable than in the second quarter and AFG reports developed for Align corroborates these trends.","Several weeks ago in an analyst meeting Patterson Dental discussed the slowdown for dental consumables. Beyond all of the survey work done, there remains a dichotomy between the tougher economic realities for the broader economy and the actual case starts we had in Q3, when compared to the optimistic views on Invisalign sounded by both consumers and doctors.","For Q3 total Invisalign case volume was 92,500 an increase of 17% year-over-year driven by growth across all customer channels. This was especially the case for North American orthodontist and international doctors which both increased about 20% from the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign case volume decreased 3% primarily due to North American GPs which declined 7%. ","For North America orthodontists Q3 case volume of 35,900 cases increased 19% year-over-year driven primarily from growth across nearly all Invisalign products especially Invisalign Teen. Q3 volume increased 1% from Q2 reflecting lower Invisalign Full cases offset by the growth from Invisalign Teen cases which increased 34% sequentially among North American Orthos.","The Invisalign Teen product is primarily targeted at younger teens 11 to 15 years old and has specific features such as compliance indicators and (inaudible) to address the needs of these younger patients. For Q3 total Invisalign Teen case shipments were 15,300 cases worldwide an increase of 30% year-over-year and 29% sequentially a positive indication of continued progress. ","As expected, both Orthos and some GPs took advantage of the Invisalign Teen\/Vivera Retainer promotion we ran this quarter in North America, which includes a free Vivera Retainer subscription for every Invisalign Teen case a customer buys.","Just as a reminder the objective of this promotion is to drive penetration Invisalign in the teenage orthodontic segment during the summer season and generate broader trial and use of Vivera Retainer. ","During Q3 last year, when we first offered the Teen\/Vivera promotion we saw a strong uptick in Invisalign Teen cases and this year we saw a similar uptick. Over the past 12 months, the doctors who participated in the promotion have subsequently grown their Invisalign Teen and Vivera case volume faster than doctors who did not participate.","In addition to reporting our results for the Invisalign Teen product we also tracked the total number of teenagers using any Invisalign product which is a more complete view of our penetration in this very important segment of the orthodontic market.","During Q3 a total of 24,500 teenager worldwide started treating with Invisalign, this is an increase of 21% sequentially and year-over-year and demonstrates our continued progress and share gain among teen to 11 and 19 years old worldwide. ","For North American GP dentist Q3 case volume of 34,700 cases increased 12% year-over-year driven by growth across all Invisalign especially Invisalign Express. On a sequential basis, Q3 GP volume decreased 7% from Q2 due to lower Invisalign Full and Assist cases. We believe softness in higher end adult procedures like full mouth restorations, veneers, and Invisalign may have played a part.","For our customers outside of North America, Invisalign volume of 21,900 increased 21% year-over-year the fourth consecutive quarter of 20% plus year-over-year growth for international. This growth was driven primarily by an increase from Invisalign distributors, especially the Asia-Pacific region, as well as from nearly all European countries that we covered directly.","As expected, Invisalign case volume outside North America was down slightly around 3% sequentially, reflecting summer seasonality primarily in southern Europe.","In our direct geographies Q3 year-over-year growth in core Europe was led by the UK and CEU comprised of Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Italy volumes were down compared to last year and while the signs of economic distress and austerity measures are obvious, we also had an execution miss. We have new country leadership in place and expect to find our way back to a growth posture much like what we did in the U.K. two years ago.","And in Asia, Q3 Invisalign case starts in China continued to ramp while Japan continues on its growth track. We see strong business growth in China, which we believe is being driven by our strategy of working with Key Opinion Leaders, going deep with top orthodontists in core cities.","We had a strong presence at the annual Chinese Orthodontic Meeting held at Peking University in September where we saw the first wave of Chinese KOLs our orthodontist\u2019s customers speaking about Invisalign in a scientific sessions presenting Invisalign, the technology, finished and cases in progress. This represents a major step forward as we now have domestic, in-country Chinese KOLs carrying the message, promoting Invisalign.","We will continue to execute on our core strategy, which is working; combined with ongoing tests to best understand the local levers of accelerating volume here in China. We remain very bullish on the long-term potential for this country.","In Q4 we will expand our focus on clinical education we will be hosting over 20 leading Chinese doctors at the North Asia Invisalign form in Macau which will bring the other top clinicians worldwide to discuss treatment of very complex cases. And in November a handful of Chinese doctors will also attend our Ortho Summit in Las Vegas. ","Q3 was another great quarter for our Invisalign distribution partners in the APAC, EMEA, and Latin America regions. Year-over-year as well as sequential growth was driven by continued strength in the APAC region, especially Australia and Hong Kong.","As a result of our continued success in the APAC region and with the upcoming expiration of the distribution agreement with our partner there, we have decided to revert Asia Pacific into a direct sales region beginning May 1, 2013.","We will be taking back the APAC organization as well as its entire team and operating expense structure. We will step up investments in the form of increased OPEX during the fourth and first quarters in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers.","In the near-term, this increased operating expense committed towards continued APAC growth and organizational continuity will create a little more operating margin pressure.","After May 1st next year, we will begin to recognize direct sales at our full ASP, rather than the significantly discounted ASP under the distribution agreement, and will thereby quickly gain revenue and contribution margin leverage. The overall economic costs of this reversion have less than a one year payback for us.","On a year-over-year basis, we saw continued adoption across our customer base in Q3 led primarily by North American doctors which is reflected in our key Invisalign metrics of utilization and new customer training. ","The year-over-year Ortho volume growth was driven by both an increase in Invisalign utilization as well as an increase in the number of new Ortho submitters. The year-over-year, GP volume growth is driven primarily by an increase in newly trained GP submitters. Sequentially, Q3 utilization rates remain flat among North American Orthos and international doctors while North American GPs actually decreased due to lower case volumes and fewer submitters. ","Among our North American GP base, we saw a decrease in Invisalign case starts across all customer tiers in particular our mid to high volume GPs. As expected we trained fewer doctors in Q3 as we typically hold fewer CE1 training events during the summer timeframe.","Moving onto product innovation. I\u2019m excited to be talking about one of the most important innovations in Invisalign Orthodontics our SmartTrack aligner material. Over the past five years working with world class partners, we have evaluated literally thousands of polymers and a variety of other materials. And our goal was to optimize conformance and comfort for the patient with the ability to consistently deliver planned forces over an extended period of time and to ensure greater predictability for even a most complex cases. ","Today we introduced a remarkable material for the world of clear aligner treatment we call SmartTrack. SmartTrack is a novel highly elastic new aligner material that delivers general, more constant force to improve the control of tooth movements with Invisalign clear aligner treatment. SmartTrack represents not just an improving in aligner material, it's a significant improvement in Invisalign system and how we leverage forced systems for more predictable tooth movement. ","We have specifically engineered a flexible material to more precisely conforms to tooth morphology, attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement across treatment. We initiated a large scale pilot with over thousand customers in May and the analysis of patients treated with aligners shows statistically significant improvement in control of tooth movements, especially for the most difficult such as rotations and extrusions.","According to Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist in Seguin, Texas and member of our Clinical Advisory Board, \u201cThe clinical results with SmartTrack have been excellent so far. The fit around the teeth from aligner to aligner is better than with any group of patients I have previously treated with Invisalign in my practice. Without a doubt, SmartTrack is the most exciting change in Invisalign technology among the many that have been introduced in recent years.\u201d","And for Dr. Werner Schupp, an orthodontist practicing in K\u00f6ln, Germany said, \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the new SmartTrack aligner material. The aligners fit better and are much more comfortable for our patients, and the tooth movement is more precise in all directions.\u201d ","The feedback to-date from our pilot doctors has been very positive and we can\u2019t wait for all of our customers and our patients to experience these revolutionary changes themselves. ","In Q1, 2013, SmartTrack will become the standard Invisalign aligner material for Invisalign clear aligners in North America and Europe as well as in other international markets where regulatory approval has been obtained. In the meantime we have begun previewing SmartTrack material on our customer portal aligntechinstitute.com. In addition, we will showcase SmartTrack at our upcoming Ortho Summit in November and in January we will host the extra webinar in advance of the worldwide launch of SmartTrack. ","As per our integrated consumer marketing platform, activity in our consumer website is a good measure of progress in this front where a perspective patients can get more information taken interactive smile assessment based on their own goals for treatment and search for Invisalign providers in their area. ","During Q3, we passed a big milestone and ended the quarter with more than 4.2 million visitors to Invisalign.com to date this year, a nice increase from the same period in 2011. In addition, web site leads are up and Find a Doctor searches are up from the same time last year","We also continue to see increasing traffic from mobile device users, with visitors to the Invisalign.com mobile site, now making up around a quarter of our total traffic when our ads are on TV.","All of these metrics tell us that prospective patients remain interested in learning more about Invisalign and for connecting with providers in their local area when they are ready to seriously continue treatment. ","Website traffic like many of our consumer metrics is positively influenced by our on-air TV presence. In early Q3 we continued leveraging the peak \u201cteen season\u201d by running our \u201cTwins\u201d TV spots to reach moms and teens. This year we were off air for three weeks in July to avoid competition with the Olympics. However, we supplemented our TV presence during those important final summer months with radio, digital, and traditional PR and event marketing, including our second year sponsoring Radio Disney\u2019s Next Big Thing Tour, which includes elements of all of those marketing channels, including a lot of Disney radio and TV placements. ","Moving now to our scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment, Q3 revenue was 9.8 million compared to 11.9 million in Q2 and 11.6 million in Q3 last year and it reflects summer seasonality. In addition, there were no major industry or Invisalign customer events that would give us additional selling opportunities like the AAO meeting in May 2012 and the GP Summit in July 2011. These major tradeshows and customer events like Invisalign Summits provide a","unique opportunity to present iTero scanners and close orders.","The announcement we made regarding our Straumann distribution agreement (inaudible). Since acquiring Cadent 18 months ago, we have been committed to enabling a digital shift within restorative dentistry, with the iTero scanner as the center of our strategy.","We have worked with Straumann over the past few years to establish a sales, services, and support model for the iTero scanner that would benefit both our companies. The global market for restorative dentistry is far more fragmented and complex than orthodontics with hundreds of thousands of labs, suppliers, general dentists, and specialists. In Europe, adoption of digital restorative technology has been further slowed due to challenging economic conditions and reluctance to invest in capital equipment.","Despite our efforts, our collaboration for distributing iTero scanners is not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. As a result, Align has decided to market iTero on a more limited basis directly in Europe focusing on our existing Invisalign customers and pursue global scanner potential on a more opportunistic basis. We will continue our direct sales of iTero scanners in North America where digital dentistry is evolving more rapidly. Over the past year, we\u2019ve invested in our scanner business in North America by doubling the number of direct sales representatives and in-office trainers, through ongoing improvements in scanner service and support, and through a robust product and applications development pipeline. We\u2019ve demonstrated this business model can work and we are confident we have the best performing scanner in the market.","Both Align and Straumann are committed to ensuring a continued high level of service and support for our existing iTero customers in Europe and North America. Straumann will continue to offer first-level equipment support in Europe for at least the next 12 months, after which full responsibility for regional customer service will transfer to Align. We are currently working together on plans for a smooth transition and will communicate details to customers as soon as they are finalized.","I will now turn the call over to Ken for a review of our Q3 financial results. Ken.","Ken Arola","Thanks Tom. Before we get in the preliminary results for the quarter, I will begin by discussing the status of our goodwill impairment testing. ","The discontinuation of Align\u2019s distribution relationship with Straumann in Europe and North America and the decline in results of operations of the Company\u2019s Scanner and CAD\/CAM Services reporting unit triggered the risk that the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Cadent might be impaired.","As a result, we are currently conducting a step one test as of September 30, 2012, to assess whether goodwill, which had a carrying value of $135.3 million as of September 30, 2012, is impaired. We expect to complete the step one impairment test prior to filing our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.","If the results of our step one analysis indicates an impairment, we will conduct a step two evaluation to determine the amount of the non-cash impairment charge, if any. If step two cannot be completed prior to filing our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, we may estimate a range of potential impairment and may record an estimated non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2012. Any difference between an estimate and the final step two evaluation would be recorded in the fourth quarter 2012.","Any difference between an estimate and the final step to evaluation will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. ","Before I move on to the third quarter financial results, I like to remind everybody that there are several items we exclude from a GAAP results when we report non-GAAP results. These include acquisition and integration related cost, amortization of intangible assets, and severance and benefits cost for the New Jersey consolidations. In my comments today, I will not review the total dollars excluded for non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses and operating margin and instead we will refer to the press release tables reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics and the business outlook summary for a complete reconciliation. ","Now let\u2019s review our preliminary third quarter financial results which do not include the impact of any potential goodwill impairment. Q3 net revenue was a total of $136.5 million which consisted of Invisalign revenue of 126.7 million and scanners and CAD\/CAM services revenue of 9.8 million. This is a sequential decrease of 6.3% from 145.6 million in quarter two 2012 and a year-over-year increase of 8.4% from 125.9 million in Q3 2011. ","Q3 Invisalign revenue of 126.7 million decreased 5.2% compared to Q2 revenue of 133.7 million and increased 10.9% compares to Q3 2011 revenue of 114.3 million. The sequential decrease in Q3 revenue was driven by lower case volume primarily across our North America GP and international doctors as well as some slightly lower Invisalign ASPs. Invisalign ASPs were lower as expected compared to last quarter due to deferrals associated with the Invisalign Teen Vivera Retainer promotion and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. On the year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign revenue growth was driven by volume increases offset somewhat by foreign exchange rates. ","Q3 scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue was $9.8 million which is a sequential decrease of 18.3% from 11.9 million in Q2 2012 and a year-over-year decrease of 15.9% from 11.6 million in Q3 2011. ","The scanner volumes were down as expected as there were no major industry or company sponsored (inaudible) in which to leverage scanner selling opportunities as compared to Q2 where we have the AAO show and several customer forums. Q3 CAD\/CAM services were flat in North America as compared to the prior quarter and international (inaudible). ","Now moving onto gross margin and operating expenses. Q3 GAAP gross margin was $100.4 million or 73.5% this compares to 108.8 million or 74.7% in quarter two and 92.4 million or 73.4% from the same quarter last year. ","Q3 GAAP gross margin for Invisalign was 77.6% and scanner and CAD\/CAM services was 20.6%. This compares to 79% and 26.6% respectively in quarter two. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 100.7 million or 73.7%, and this compares to 109.2 million or 75% in quarter two and 93 million or 73.9% in the same quarter last year.","For Invisalign there was no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 or Q2 of 2012 and Q3 of 2011. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects lower Invisalign case volume which result in under absorption of manufacturing cost and the impact from lower ASPs.","For scanner and CAD\/CAM services, Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 23.8% compared to 30.3% last quarter. The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin reflects lower production volumes instead of under absorption of manufacturing spend coupled with excess training capacities during the seasonally slower summer quarter. ","Q3 GAAP operating expense was 71.2 million compared to Q2 of 72.8 million and 66.1 million from the same quarter of last year. Q3 non-GAAP operating expense was 70 million and this compares to 71.6 million in quarter two and 53.8 million in the same quarter of last year.","The decrease in Q3 non-GAAP operating expense in primarily due to lower media spending as we went out there during the Olympics as well as fewer industry and customer events being held in quarter three. ","Q3 GAAP operating income was 29.2 million or 21.4%, this compares to 36 million or 24.7% in quarter two and 26 million or 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was 30.6 million or 22.4%, this compares to 37.6 million or 25.8% in quarter two and 29.2 million or 23.2% in the same quarter of last year. ","Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29 compared to $0.34 in quarter two and $0.24 in the same quarter of last year. And Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compares to $0.34 in quarter two and $0.27 in Q3 of last year. ","Now moving onto the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including long-term investments were $348.9 million, this compares to 248.1 million at the end of 2011. In Q3, we generated roughly 40.3 million in cash from operations compares to 27.3 million in quarter two and 41.5 million in the same quarter of last year. ","DSO for the quarter was 70 days compared to 63 days in quarter two and 62 days in the same quarter last year. The increase in DSO this quarter primarily reflect less shipment linearity in the quarter and a slightly slowing of customer payments in September. Overall, our aging remains in solid shape and I\u2019d expect DSO to trend downward in Q4.","Under our stock repurchase program, we bought approximately 213,000 shares of our common stock in Q3 at an average price of $34.15 per share for a total of approximately 7.3 million. There remains 132.5 million available under the company\u2019s existing stock repurchase authorization. ","Now let\u2019s turn to our business outlook for Q4 2012 and the factors that inform our view. ","First, we experienced greater than expected summer seasonality in North America, from both GP dentists and Orthodontists. This softness has persisted into October which resulted in lower case receipts from which Q4 shipments are generated. However, busy sales force activity and patient traffic in October points to renewed growth for the Invisalign business.","Second, Q4 is historically a stronger quarter for international doctors as they come back from summer vacations and we would expect that to be the case this year as well.","Third, Q4 is historically the heaviest buying period for capital equipment purchasers in North America. In order to make the most of this year-end buying cycle, we are offering a promotion of $4,000 off an iTero scanner in Q4. There are also two major events we will be leveraging in Q4, the ADA meeting going on in San Francisco this week and our Invisalign Ortho Summit in November. As a result of these sales and promotional activities, we expect North American scanner sales to increase nicely from Q3. For International, we do not expect any contribution due to the termination of the iTero distribution agreements with Straumann announced today.","And lastly, given the slowdown we have seen recently, we are more cautious about consumer behavior in the near term and their willingness to move forward with higher value procedures like Invisalign. With that as a backdrop, we anticipate Invisalign case volume to be in a range of 90 to 93,000 cases. ","We expect Q4 total revenues to be in the range of 134.2 to 137.8 million. Overall, we expect our revenue outlook to have slight impact from Invisalign ASPs resulting from rebates and product mix offset by not running the team of promotion in quarter four.","We will be running a new promotion in quarter four for Invisalign Express 5 which offers doctors $200 off the list price and is intended to drive higher trial and repeat use. Q4 revenues also reflects lower iTero scanner ASPs due to the year-end iTero scanner promotions I just mentioned. ","Now let\u2019s move onto gross margin. We expect Q4 GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 71.7 to 72.1%, and we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 71.9 to 72.3%. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflect expected increases in freight cost related to international shipment and an increase in training cost as we plan to train more doctors in quarter four and to a lesser extent ASPs.","In Q4 we expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of 73.6 million to 74.9 million. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be in the range of 72.6 to 73.9 million. ","We expect the sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expense relates to a greater number of customer events like the ADA meeting, the Greater New York Dental Show and our Ortho Summit. Additionally, we will be increasing our investment for Asia-Pac to ensure a smooth transition back to address sales regions. ","We expect Q4 GAAP operating margin to be in a range of 16.9 to 17.7% and GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.23 excluding any impact from potential impairment charges. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 17.8 to 18.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.23.","In Q4 we expect GAAP to GAAP effective tax rates to be approximately 21% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 84.5 million and cash on hand to be in the range of 385 to 395 million. ","With that I will now turn the call back to Tom for some closing comments.","Tom Prescott","Thanks Ken. In summary, the team here at Align is as excited about the future as I have ever seen them and it's easier for me to understand why. That\u2019s over thousand enthusiastic customer participating in a large commercialization pilot, if you are hearing the SmartTrack is the biggest innovation in Invisalign technology ever and when combined with the G3 and G4 steps which perceive them enables treatment of far more complex cases with greater patient comfort. ","We are in the process of bringing our APAC distribution back in-house, gaining greater confidence and our ability to drive the business in our fastest growing geographies in the world. Where we staging growth in Europe even in regions like the UK where austerity programs and slow-to-zero growth at the norm. We continue to do well with our scanner business in North America where our direct sales model is successfully leveraging our Invisalign resources. In China, we continue to see strong Invisalign growth and remain bullish on its long-term potential. And around the world, we continue to gain share in the important teenager market. ","We are not satisfied with recent quarter or Q4 guidance. We yet know they describe the business growing volume over 16% annually with huge head remaining for expansion. We intend to continue on with good execution of our important strategic initiatives and have the confidence we will deliver great results for our customers and their patients, our shareholders and our committed employees. ","I look forward to seeing you at trade shows and investor events over the next few months as well as reporting back to you with our progress in the quarter. And with that let\u2019s get right to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Matt Dolan with Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","First, I just wanted to dig into what you are seeing on the growth side of the equation first, I think if we look back to I think few years ago you struggled out of the summer and there was some execution issues then, I think you may have referred to here again. Normally you guys have a lot of visibility into the upcoming quarter, so what can you tell us on a go forward basis about either stability or I think you said in your prepared remarks there is renewed interest in Q4 despite what sounds like has been a pretty slow September and October?","Tom Prescott","Well the first thing I will refer back to is the kind of this dichotomy that is existed between the channels checks, we and others have done and they are still showing strong consumer interest yet not necessarily translating into Invisalign case starts. What I say, we have seen some renewed activity now into October a bit and we believe that will start to generate. The second thing I think if you are referring back to couple of years ago, we do expect Europe to contribute more towards growth in Q4 where we did not have that outlook say in Q4 of two years ago. So, again we think the business is healthy, we wish we had all the answers, I think there is probably few maybe broader secular trends going on in dentistry that others have called out, but what we are going to try to do is just make sure that the activity in the offices turns into case starts and that\u2019s what we are focused on.","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","So, I guess maybe just to clarify, I think you guys did say that you felt like there is a renewed interest in Q4 even though October was slow. Again is this something maybe did the promotions that came early in Q2 pulled some revenue that you otherwise would have thought you had into earlier in the year. What gives you that thought that things are picking up later this quarter. ","Tom Prescott","We are sitting here on the 17th and as we are managing actively, we are hearing a lot of activity in the offices, patients are coming back in the offices and I will contrast that with two year ago when we still did not have what seem like positive activity even when we went to our call in October. And that in fact did not pick up until late in mid to late November or early December. So, we see the signs f good activity. Doctors are reporting, calendars are filling up again and there are a lot of good signs. We will watch that closely, that is reflected in our view going forward. ","Matt Dolan - Roth Capital Partners","And then the second topic, I wanted to make sure we touched on was on the earning guidance side of the equation. Obviously revenues are expected to be flat, it looks like really the measure difference quarter-to-quarter here into Q4 is the gross margin. I know you mentioned freight cost, but that it seems like international has been relatively flat or even down as a percentage of sales. So, why the 200 basis point hit their which is big part of the delta between the two periods.","Ken Arola","Freight, as we ship more and more products internationally the cost of get the product over there with the volume that we are looking at on a historical basis and the growth on the international business we are expecting that to grow nicely again this year. And given where we are, we are expecting our freight cost to be up on a sequential basis over Q3. If you think about Q3, volumes were down in Europe as is typically are. So, when you go in sequential basis Q3 to Q4 you have a greater impact of freight for those international shipments. Also with the shipments that are growing faster in the Asia-Pac region again that picked up additional freight cost to get product over to Asia-Pac as appose to Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Tom. I just had one to talk to you about the weakness in the case shipment growth this quarter. Now if you look at kind of where the weakness was, it seems like North American GPs was clearly the worst segment down the most sequentially we actually had positive growth in on the North American orthodontic community and international did somewhere in the middle. Is there something to be said here about the trend that the general practitioner in 3Q that you think can reverse itself in 4Q or do you feel like just give us some feedback on what your sales guys are telling you about what they are seeing in the market?","Tom Prescott","Let me break that into two pieces, first about maybe what happened and second about how we see it going forward. First in terms of what we saw playing out in Q3 and I think you chronicled this pretty well. I think in the GP there was a softness, there was a slowdown, there has been reports of especially in the higher value procedures area on both LA, New York, some of the higher value procedures like full mouth restorations (inaudible) that really slowing down significantly. So, in general with GP practices even our higher volume customers which of all the groups really slowed down the most. They tend to react more to patient traffic coming in and kind of people asking for procedures rather than initiating those conversation. So, when patients are more passive or when traffic goes down, they tend to pull back and don't compensate by initiating more they literally just pull back a bit more. So, it's a different reaction, for the Ortho the specialist they are used to dealing with referral whether it came from own efforts or from a GP that they work with and they are used to jump in on those points of interest whether it's a first call or a patient coming in is really seriously considering. ","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Tom I appreciate all of that detail and we haven\u2019t had the chance to work on our model but just kind of looking at the guidance that you have given for 4Q, it kind of assumes that you are looking at maybe flattish case shipment growth. So, just want to be clear on what you are saying because it sounds like October started off kind of sluggish but yet in your answer to my question you just sort of said you starting to see a little bit of a pickup in activity and so in terms of case shipment growth what are you building into expectations on a sequential basis in Q4?","Tom Prescott","As Ken described well, the softness that we saw for September and into October that\u2019s the basis of our October shipments, what shipping to patients and customers right now. And when that soft or obviously October shipments therefore revenues are little softer. We have seen in year's where Q4 can finish very strongly, the first thing that has to happen is activity in office (inaudible). It recently is stronger than it was in September as we reported and so I think there is what we can\u2019t get to September volume, that anchors October shipments for all practical purposes, but we do see building on that as we leave October with growing receipts in November and December. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company","Tom to what degree to you think coming back on the market with Ortho products may have had an impact in the third quarter in terms of the case volumes?","Tom Prescott","We actually as we look at that pretty hard we have done some survey work from a variety of sources and our data show that we are still nicely taking share from all categories of brackets, traditional, etcetera and that\u2019s in teen and adult. So, we think if [GSE] products going back on which is a good thing, they are an important part of this industry and that was a tough deal for them. But that\u2019s probably coming out of the height of somebody else in the bracket and wire side does not appear to be a factor for us.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company","Have you finalized your plans in terms of how you expect to handle the U.S. medical device excise tax that goes into effect next year, and to what degree do you think you will be able to pass that onto incremental pricing or expense reductions if at all.","Tom Prescott","I\u2019d say like every other medical device company we are working our tails off to both prepared systems and capabilities to be able to do this, even though there is no rule making in place yet at [TRF]. So, I think the simple fact is we are working on all our options and I\u2019d say that that\u2019s still process in place and we will talk about it much more fully when we do guidance and our view of how we are going to handle all this time next quarter. ","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company","Any chance you can give us the inventory balance at the end of the third quarter and then what CapEx was in the third quarter and then it looks like a much bigger number in terms of CapEx for the fourth quarter that I\u2019d have anticipated given some of the facility relocations etcetera, winding down now here. Just where do we stand on two fronts. ","Ken Arola","Inventories at the end of September were basically $15 million of which about 13 million or so of that was related to the scanner business that we have been building up some inventory here in preparation for a move in Israel which we actually just completed. So, as far as your other question on CapEx, in quarter four we have about guidance was about 12 million or so of CapEx, and that has to do with some additional equivalent or buying to put down in the facility in Juarez to handle increased capacity over time here as well as some of the outfitting of some facilities cost and stuff like that improvement point of view. As far as CapEx this quarter, we spent I think there was about $6 million or so CapEx in Q3. And again that was mostly related to manufacturing equipment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Tom, given what we are looking at now for the fourth quarter revenue, looking like it's into the single digits on an organic basis growth. Can you just walk us through the steps that get you back to the 15 to 25% growth that you are looking for over the longer term? Your confidence is clearly not shaken here, so just walk us through the macro new features any sort of recover drivers in the business that you think you can quantify to get us to 25.","Tom Prescott","I will reinforce that I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re recovery mode. Certainly and that\u2019s satisfied with our results in Q3 or the guidance we have given in Q4 the profile has been running with, but we are not in recover mode at all. The drivers as we said before this business won\u2019t be perfect and it won\u2019t be perfectly linear and we have demonstrated both of those here. So, the reality is we have adoption grows, core utilization grows among say orthodontist in a non-linear way. When we bring out new technologies that the earliest adopters that highest volume user the most technique sense of users who get a chance to get after it and then they start trying those new features on more and more kinds of cases. ","So, we can now really precisely deliver force systems and do it in a way that\u2019s better for the patients and doc. So, we expect over the next couple of years we expect that to reinforce core adoption and I\u2019ll remind you we have given even as where we are which we have done pretty well. We are still a very small player in unit and unit share and we have tons of head room in virtually every orthodontic indication. So, our goal is looking at a graph on our wall is making sure we grow penetration. ","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And then just one big picture. The business it seems like year-on-year was down a couple of million on a basis on 11.5 so down 1.5. I think the expectations are just to be a real growth market but the environment is evolving pretty quickly, you have the three maybe five new competitors on the market next year, but of course you have an advantage position being one of the bigger players in the market. Is that a business that you can get to grow double-digits next year or other extreme is something like what we have seen in this quarter and with the expectations for price to come down effectively next quarter is that more of an appropriate way to think about it. Is this more of a driver for the aligner business. Can you help us parse out the different pieces there?","Tom Prescott","Two things, first of all we believe an have reinforced that this is a very strategic part of very early evolution, major evolution in the dental industry and being able to be at chair side, capture digital data, to be able to bring a wider set of applications to the dentist or the specialist is a very big deal and with few exceptions, for 27 years and they built a significant install base and can sell into that with upgrades. There are very few companies today that I say standalone on a scanner base have got big business. We have got one of the biggest install bases out there but we still think we are getting started. Overtime we believe this on its own merits can be a very successful business and return to growth. I mean it is pretty lumpy right now given uncertainty and all of those things, and even more so in Europe. But we believe that the kind of growth rates to identify data and other third parties are there to be had but we have taken a longer term view of this business. ","The second part of that is you asked about Invisalign, I\u2019m not going to quote the numbers here but we continue to see a substantial amount of our incoming cases now done by scans, at the meaningful number and growing very nicely every single quarter. I\u2019d just say friction goes down for everybody involved, the patient, the doctor in a practice and Align in so many ways is faster, better, cheaper, easier, more precise. Aligner seem to fit better, the whole cycle of case to shipment is faster, and that\u2019s the trend it's continuing. ","The second thing is the doctors that use, take all the Orthos that have put scanners in, there is a meaningful number of increased cases, they are doing more than every other cohort around them, whether they were of small low volume and medium volume or a high volume Ortho. On average they are doing a significantly greater number of cases on a quarterly or annual basis and that\u2019s just again from reducing (inaudible). We are in the early stages of it, but there is a lot of positive signs and we are in this for the long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald","I just wanted to come back to pricing very quickly. This is once again we saw average revenue per case down. I know lot of its tied to promotional activities, volume rebates. Where does this trend go as we look into next year? Obviously the promotions with this quarter, (inaudible) obviously done a great job in driving volume growth. Is there a point where you are worried about slowing down the promotional activities and seeing a slowdown in volume growth or how do you think about overall pricing going into the next year or so. ","Ken Arola","I\u2019d just start out by saying pricing has been very stable for us over the past number of years. We haven\u2019t changed prices for a number of year's now on our products and we have chosen to do is at various points in time pointed promotions. So, over the long-term we think it's a good opportunity to be a growth driver in the business. We are run our advantage program for the doctors on the consistent basis on a year-over-year, we see doctors continuing to move up overtime in the number of cases that they are doing. Some quarters they move faster than other, this last quarter the biggest impact ASPs from a promotional point of view is certainly the teams of various promotion on a sequential basis and the other piece that you didn\u2019t mention was really the foreign exchange rates that they moved pretty quickly from Q2 to Q3. Our view is that we will continue to look at promotions at appropriate times in the year for the business on the Invisalign as well as the iTero side of the business for example the 4,000 off promotion running in quarter four that will stimulate more placements of scanners in the marketplace. ","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald","And on the competitive side, are you guys seeing any pickup inactivity from any of the newer entrance in the clear aligner space?","Tom Prescott","No, not really, I mean we watched this very, very carefully and I think if there is a little, so we are more than holding share for the other small players that are out there in clear aligner and Ortho. In GP, we may have had a little leakage we think call it that against Clear Correct we think, frankly Q1 and Q2 especially among lower volume GPs. And we think most of that was price driven maybe through group on and stuff like that. But we don't see any kind of longer term trends and we have not seen a kind of traction among consistent users from any other player. We see trial from time to time and then based with the features they don't have and can\u2019t get and the capability that other players don't have the trend to revert back to Invisalign. So, that\u2019s been the pattern where obviously trying to find the balance being confident and paranoid.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John Kreger - William Blair","Tom, we can just think about the growth that you have seen in recent months from a little bit different perspective. We certainly compare that it's been a tough environment in dental but, I think we also would have said that was probably the case a year ago or few quarters ago. So, if you think about what do you think is really going on from a broader perspective? Do you think there is less orthodontic starts going on across the market or maybe less uptick by orthodontist as the excitement on G3 and G4 as perhaps faded a bit. What is the bigger picture on market share?","Tom Prescott","So, first of all we had a very strong first half and we had a very strong Q1, and carried a lot of that into Q2 with AOO and all of that. So, I don't know if it was more patient driven or practice driven, I don't know and we struggled to find primary data in this area that\u2019s useful. So, what we are left with is the data we can get from third parties our own several times a quarter bottoms up and top down views our own qualitative and quantitative research with groups of customers and it's a pretty mixed bag, but for whatever set of reasons in the summer the late summer and into September, it was just like the offices were less engaged and there was less traffic. ","John Kreger - William Blair","So, just a quick follow-up from our perspective G3 and G4 were very well received in the market. As you think about SmartTrack since this is new to us what do you think the significant is the SmartTrack relative to G3 and G4 more or less impactful?","Tom Prescott","We have our own views and we always have a set of metrics, we applied to any new major project innovation, product innovation and we track whether quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year how we are doing against whether it's case complexity we are measuring, getting more class two cases whether we are looking at that sort of adoptions within certain practices. So, we haven\u2019t started those things, setup and we will see how it does, but one of the very clear points of feedback since May, for example when we did the earlier pilots the doctors that we are treating patients said I don't want to go back to old material please let me keep this. And then some of them were involved in the commercialization pilot in May. ","John Kreger - William Blair","And then one last one, if you think about the guidance you have given us for Q4, does that guidance assume a better lift in volumes in the second half of the quarter late October into November and December. Are you assuming more of a steady state with what you are seeing so far early days in the quarter?","Ken Arola","John, we actually don't really comment on inter-quarter trend that we are looking that so what we are trying to point out in the call is that we saw the softness in September and into early October here, but on the contrary we are seeing activity in doctors office that\u2019s still being pretty active, our sales force again is still active with the doctor based in, so our view is that as Tom said with activity picking up to help us as we go forward here.","","Shirley Stacy","Thank you every one for joining us today.

He doesn\u2019t officially start until June 1st, so we won\u2019t make him answer any questions about the business, but he will be happy to take a couple of your questions during Q&A about why he is so excited of joining Align.","Let me turn now to our first quarter results. On our call today I\u2019ll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments Invisalign Clear Aligner, and Scanner and Services. I\u2019ll also include some commentary on our performance with customers as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call up to questions.","Our first quarter was a bit stronger than we expected getting us off to a good start to the year. This progress was driven by continued strong year-over-year growth by international team and solid improvement in our North America business as well. We are pleased to have delivered better than expected results, with strong revenues, margins and EPS driven primarily by higher Invisalign volume from our North American orthodontists.","Our Q1 results reflect continued execution of our strategic plan including our three key strategic growth drivers which are market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. Market expansion comprises in many ways. We are working to expand the adult orthodontic treatment category with clear aligner therapy, increase our share of the Teenage orthodontic market and open up new and existing markets and geographies around the world.","In Q1 we brought back the Benelux countries and converted them into direct sales geographies for our EMEA region and in May we will further expand our directly covered country markets in Asia-Pacific by adding Taiwan. As with the previous countries added, we will leverage our existing infrastructure from the adjacent country teams to build local sales coverage, drive long-term market penetration and begin to create a much stronger consumer brand for Invisalign. The very important key segment, which today in still mostly North American market represent approximately three quarters of worldwide orthodontic case starts each year. Execution of our strategy is enabling us to continue to gain share against other brackets and wires players.","As of Q1 more than 121,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign over the past 12 months of 16.3% from the prior year in orthodontic market that is growing in a low to mid single-digits overall. With all our progress we are far from realizing our full potential in Teenage segment now really just getting started in EMEA and APAC regions where we are implementing focused initiatives to drive awareness and preference for Invisalign for teens.","Q2 marks the start of the busy summer teen orthodontic season and we have new team sales programs and an orchestrated marketing effort designed to increase our doctors confidence in Invisalign or overcoming key barriers which may keep them from recommending Invisalign more often for the teenage patients. These new programs include case studies detailing how to drive increase practice growth and profitability by integrating teen Invisalign cases how to better utilize practice referrals and leverage Invisalign marketing and the team confidence study.","Product innovation aims to create greater doctor preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to increase our doctor\u2019s confidence in treating patients with Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. As the science, technology and clinical capability behind Invisalign continues to evolve and expand, our ability to gain incremental share of orthodontic case starts expands with it. During Q1 we began initial commercialization activities for Invisalign G6 our solution for first pre-molar extraction cases including speaker training and lounge workshops. The initial feedback from targeted Invisalign providers shows excitement about the potential for more effective treatment of these extraction cases, this is especially true in our Asian markets where extraction cases represent over 70% of the cases presenting to the doctor.","Feedback has also been very positive across Europe for orthodontists Invisalign G6 as a significant step towards the expansion of Invisalign applicability to a broad range of increasingly complex malocclusion. While still very early in our launch process over 220 doctors have already submitted Invisalign G6 cases. In Q2 we will begin full launch activities for Invisalign G6 including expanded training for Invisalign doctors and our sales and customer support teams. Over 3,000 customers are expected to attend Invisalign G6 live lab event across the EMEA and APAC region. During Q1 we also launched ClinCheck Pro in EMEA and APAC.","The significant ClinCheck software evolution has been extremely well received and already nearly half of our customers in EMEA and APAC have now switched to the new platform attracted by enhancements on 3D control and efficiency. And finally brand strength, the brand strength of Invisalign remains one of Align's key differentiators for both doctors and their patients. Align has built a superior brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social networking and event marketing. Our goals are to make Invisalign a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to insist on Invisalign for getting the healthier more beautiful smile they've always wanted.","In North America we saw positive growth in virtually all key consumer demand metrics as a result of cross general marketing, efforts across TV, digital, social media, and PR channels. As a result the numbers of consumers searching for the Invisalign brand grew significantly. We also had good growth in unique visitors to invisalign.com as well as a step up in the number of dark locator searches. Our focus on social media has enabled a substantial increase in followers across Invisalign social media properties like Facebook, Twitter and more. As a key element in social media we continue to see user generated content from patients describing their Invisalign journey as the top performing content on Invisalign social channels.","And in preparation for the upcoming Teen orthodontic season we will kick off one of our largest efforts of the year targeting to the mom audience promoting Invisalign Teen through our un-braced teen confidence campaign which leverages our Teen confidence study published last year. Results of the study highlight the struggle teens have with their self confidence during the teenage years and the teens wearing Invisalign aligners had a 2x boost in self esteem when compared to teens wearing metal braces. In EMEA while our overall consumer programs are on a smaller scale we have made good use of digital media to effectively reach our target audience while accelerating social media, experiential events and PR activities. We continue to drive significant increases and awareness of Invisalign year-over-year. The Invisalign EU social media community continues to grow with double the number of fans from the same period last year.","Globally as a brand we recently celebrated a milestone of 3 million Invisalign smiles by inviting our customers, patients, consumers and employees to help spread even more smiles by providing a large donation to Operation Smile. We did this by asking everyone to do something very simple, to post a picture of their smile with the hashtag, hashtag 3 million smiles, and for every smile shared in this way we would donate a dollar to Operation Smile up to a million dollars over the campaign. If you're not familiar with this very worthy cause, I'd like you to look into the profound impact they have on children and adults born with cleft lip and cleft palate, especially in countries with little to no access to care. Amazing things are doing at operation smile and needs financial support to reach even more children for this life changing procedure.","You may have seen our full page ad in New York Times earlier to kick this effort off to-date this has been a very successful way to engage with our community generating thousands of posts that we're seeing over 9 million times across the globe. There are plenty of highlights to share here and since we included some details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides I'll skip the details and let you review it by yourself. Taken together these three key strategic growth drivers market expansion, product innovation and brand strength provide us with a great set of levers to build the business giving us confidence in our plans for continued long-term growth.","With these growth drivers in mind let's talk about how we did in Q1 by sharing a few customer and geographic highlights. In Q1 the North America business demonstrated continued progress, during the quarter our practices reported solid patient traffic and procedure volumes across the board including for Invisalign. On a sequential basis Q1 growth was driven primarily from North American orthodontists with the utilization going to 9 cases per doctor for the first time ever. This utilization increase reflects continued traction from our cycle of product innovations including Invisalign G5 or D5 launched early last year, additionally we believe the evolution in our go to market strategy discussed in our Q4 call is creating some positive impact a little earlier than expected. We're pleased to see some initial traction and expect more meaningful contribution from these changes in the back half of the year and beyond.","Moving to our international business, Q1 Invisalign volume was down slightly on a sequential basis as expected, reflecting a seasonally slower period in the EMEA region, mostly offset by higher than expected volume from Asia Pacific. This was especially the case in China with continued growth, despite the Lunar New Year in mid-February. On a year-over-year international basis growth remains strong, driven by continued momentum from product innovation and Go-To-Market expansion. Our Q1 results reflect increased adoption from our existing customer base and accelerated option from new trained doctors across all international geographies and channels. ","In the EMEA region Q1 Invisalign case volume increased 25.1% year-over-year reflecting growth across all country markets, especially in Spain. We are also very pleased with improved performance in Italy and the UK. Our new direct markets in Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and now Benelux, are also generating initially high growth levels albeit on a small base, as our renewed focus on sales and clinical education was trying pay-off.","In the APAC region Invisalign case volume increased 37.5% year-over-year reflecting continued strong growth across all countries, while China and Japan continue to deliver the fastest growth. We\u2019re also seeing solid growth in Southeast Asia, in Australia and, New Zealand.","Now turning to our scanner business, in Q1 our scanner and services business revenues were down sequentially as we expected. The decrease in revenue also reflected reduced pricing offering for the current iTero scanner to bridge commercial availability for the new iTero Element scanner announced last month at International Dental Show, IDS in Germany.","The iTero Element is engineered to deliver everything that doctors appreciate about iTero Scanner except in a more complex footprint with even great capabilities. The smaller design with enhanced wand, multi-touch display and new image sensor is engineered to enable 20 times faster scan speed with color scanning for more precise clinical evaluation. We were excited to have the opportunity to preview the new scanner at IDS and we\u2019re pleased to be receiving very positive responses from existing iTero users, as well as from potential new customers. Both our very interested in Element\u2019s new, and smaller form-factor, faster scans, and expanded capabilities. IDS also marked the beginning of our expanding Go-To-Market resources in the EMEA and APAC regions for the iTero platform. We expect initial shipments of the iTero Element intraoral scanner to begin in the second half of 2015. ","Well we are proud to have the best scanner on the market with the greatest utility for our customers. We also believe there is even greater opportunity for customers to benefit from our Align Technology\u2019s Open Systems approach, both for our iTero scanners, as well as for the Invisalign system. We have worked hard to qualify other leading intraoral scanners that have the potential capability to deliver high quality interoperability with the Invisalign case submission process. To that end, at IDS last month, we announced interoperability for Invisalign case submission with Sirona CEREC Omnicam. This qualification enables Invisalign providers with a CEREC Omnicam and the new CEREC Ortho Software 1.1 to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression.","We look forward to working with the Sirona team to ensure their customers and patients have a great Invisalign experience. And with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David for review of our Q1 financial results. David?","David White","Thanks, Tom. Note that this fiscal year, we are consolidating some of the supplementary product and geographic breakdowns that we provide for volumes and revenue as well as combining sales and marketing expense with general and administrative. We will continue to explain the performance of our products in geographies and include commentaries appropriate. However, we believe the consolidated view of our quarterly financials is more consistent with disclosures respect to peer group. Let\u2019s review our first quarter financial results.","Revenue for the first quarter was $198.1 million, down 0.3% from the prior quarter and up 9.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. First quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $187 million was up 0.3% sequentially and up 11.2% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth reflected higher volume from our North American ortho doctors, offset slightly by lower volume from our international doctors as well as lower worldwide ASPs. Q1 ASPs were down sequentially $35, of which approximately $32 or $4.2 million in aggregate, was related to foreign exchange rates.","Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to foreign exchange rates. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 138,000 cases were up 3.1% sequentially, reflecting growth from our North American orthodontists and to a less extend North American GP customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 16.6% reflecting continued strength in international as well as strong demand from our North American orthodontists. Our North American orthodontists Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 7.9% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentist, case volume was up 1.6% sequentially and 6.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 0.9% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Q1 marks the sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth for our international region.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was 4.5 cases per doctor up slightly from 4.3 in Q1 last year. North American ortho utilization of 9.0 was a new record increasing from 8.1 in the prior year. North America GP utilization of 2.9 was flat compared with the prior year and international doctor utilization of 4.4 was up slightly from 4.3 in the prior year. In Q1 we added 2410 new Invisalign doctors worldwide 870 of which were new North American doctors and 1,540 of which were new international doctors. First quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was $11.1 million a decrease of 9.1% sequentially and 10.9% year-over-year while unit sales of our scanner were slightly down relative to each period most of the revenue decline was the result of reduced pricing for the current iTero scanner which Tom previously commented on.","Moving on to gross margin, first quarter gross margin was 76.3% overall up sequentially 0.4 points and 0.3 points year-over-over. The Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 79.1% up 0.3 point sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential increase is primarily the result of higher volumes and seasonally lower training costs offset by lower ASPs as mentioned. Q1 gross margin for the scanner segment was 28.3% down 1.9 point sequentially and 5.3 points year-over-year both as a result of lower ASPs as previously mentioned. Q1 operating expenses were a $102.2 million up sequentially by $3 million from $99.2 million reported in Q4. In aggregate overall operating expenses were up by $9.8 million primarily related to increased employee headcount and compensation expense related to our annual employee performance reprocess, increased legal fees and investments in OSA product development which was offset in part by a benefit of $6.8 million associated with a medical device excise tax refund for a net sequential increase of $3 million.","You'll recall a year ago that we had extensive discussions with the IRS in which they informed that our clear aligners are not subject to this tax, accordingly we stopped accruing and paying this tax in March 2014, however a refund of our 2013 payments would require separate application, review and approval. That approval was received this quarter. The after tax benefit of this refund on EPS in the quarter was $0.06.","On a year-over-year basis Q1 operating expenses were up $6.7 million which includes the benefit of the medical excise tax refund just mentioned reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activities as well as product and technology development as we talked about at length in our Q4 year-end earnings call in January.","Our first quarter operating margin was 24.7% down 1.2 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. First quarter results included the aforementioned medical excise tax refund of $6.8 million which benefited operating margins by 3.4 points. Excluding the margin benefit from this refund operating margins were down both sequentially and year-over-year relating to new investments in our three strategic growth drivers as we previously discussed.","Other income and expense included $1.7 million of charges primarily related to foreign currency losses related to customer payments with the continued weakening of the euro to the U.S. dollar comprising most of that. Altogether the quarter-over-quarter impact for foreign exchange as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar including the decline on revenues, the benefits on our non U.S. dollar operating expenses together with currency exchange losses was reported in other income and expense was $0.03 per share.","While currency has certainly dampened to some extent our business results, we believe continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives will accelerate current year and long-term growth with a leverage of our business model will ultimately overcome the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In tandem with those investments however we do intend to begin commencing some of our current hedging, some of our currency exposures to mitigate some of the inter quarter volatility we've been experiencing commencing in Q2.","With regards to our first quarter tax provision our tax rate was 23.8%, slightly up from our 2014 tax rate due to higher permanent tax differences on certain expenses that are not deductible. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.44 compared to $0.48 reported in Q4, and $0.39 reported in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, for the first quarter our accounts receivable balance was $138.2 million up approximately 6.5% sequentially, our overall DSO was 63 days up five days sequentially and flat over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $15.6 million, primarily relating to a second facility purchased in Lars, Mexico for aligner fabrication as well as manufacturing equipment and set up costs for that facility as we add additional capacity as well as additional cost capitalized on our enterprise system project.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $35.6 million. And free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $20 million. The company repurchased approximately 31,000 shares of stock of $1.8 million during the quarter on the open market. This repurchase mark the completion of the first $100 million of the $300 million stock repurchase program we announced the year ago at this time. We expect to announce our plans for our second $100 million shortly. ","In this regard I\u2019d like to mention the fact that when we file our first quarter 10-Q that our cash flow statement will indicate cash outlays of $14.6 million the payment of employee taxes. This figure relates to the company\u2019s practice of issuing vested employees restricted stock, or views on a net basis, which we recently adopted for all employee stock awards. This means that instead of employees having to sell some of their vested shares to pay their payroll related taxes. The company issues the net amount of the shares to employees and pays the payroll taxes on their behalf. ","So in an indirect manner this $14.6 million should be reviewed as additional stock repurchases by the company offsetting to some extent the dilution that will otherwise have resulted from the issuance of the shares. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $613 million. This compares to $602.6 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $10.4 million. With that let\u2019s now turn to our business outlook for the second quarter and the factors that are inform our view. ","Starting with the demand outlook, the second quarter is typically seasonally stronger period for our North American doctors and we\u2019re seeing the strength of our first quarter volume trends continuing early into the second quarter and aggregate we expect Invisalign for North America to be up sequentially in Q2. Q2 is seasonally a busier quarter for our international doctors and we\u2019re anticipating Invisalign shipments to increase sequentially from Q1. With the recent announcement of the new iTero Element scanner which available in the second half of the year and reduce pricing we\u2019ve implemented on our current scanner we anticipate some of our customers may delay purchase decisions as they evaluate choices. Therefore we expect Q2 scanner and services revenues to be down sequentially from Q1.","This is a backdrop we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 139.5 to 142,000 cases up approximately 18% over the same period a year ago at the midpoint of the range and above our three year average. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $206.6 million to $210.4 million a sequential increase from Q1 primarily driven by the higher volume just mentioned and a small price increase in North America affective April 1st, each of which are partially offset again by lower ASPs assuming a weaker euro.","We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.7% down slightly quarter-over-quarter primarily result of lower ASPs and a higher number of new doctor training events. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $117.3 million to $118.3 million a sequential increase compared to Q1 largely as result of benefit we\u2019ve recognized in Q1 for the medical excise tax refund as well as higher expenses associated with our strategic investments.","Our operating margin should be in the range of 18.3% to 19.5%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 82 million excluding any stock repurchases as mentioned earlier. Taken together we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.38. On a constant currency basis our Q1 average -- using Q1 average exchange rates the Q2 outlook would have been approximately $0.02 higher. With that I\u2019ll now turn the time back over to Tom for closing comments.","Tom Prescott","Thanks David. We\u2019re extremely pleased that we\u2019ve seen strong performance in all regions getting us off to a good start to the year. In every direction we look, our strategy is working well. In market expansion as our continued investments in go-to-market initiatives delivered volume growth from better coverage and support. In product innovation the adoption growth continue to be driven by our innovation cycle for both Invisalign and our scanner technology. In brand strength as we reached more and more consumers hoping them connect with the right practice ensuring they get a great Invisalign treatment experience.","The significant growth initiatives we discussed during our year-end call including our expectations from most of the impact showing up in our second half results. While we\u2019re pleased to see some of the positive impact early in the we do expect to see continued progress throughout 2015 as more of Align\u2019s key initiatives begin a great leverage in the business.","There is never an ideal time for our company to have change in the CEO but there are better times to make this important transition in new leadership. As figure today there is clear evidence of our solid execution of Align\u2019s winning strategy demonstrating continued and sustainable progress for the business. We have a strong leadership team and great talent across the Align organization. The Company has outstanding prospects for continues growth in revenue and earnings and expect to be a market leader for the long-term, so while there's never an ideal time this is certainly not a bad time to make this change.","After 13 years of leading this company and following a well executed succession plan this is a good time for me to step aside effective June 1. I'm extremely pleased to welcome Joe Hogan as the new President of Align Technology. Joe is a rare leader with a talent for building great teams and winning the race with a passion for customers and their patients, with the intellectual curiosity to challenge and accelerate our pace of innovation and the leadership experience to ensure this company is a market leader for the long term. We are lucky to land him as our new CEO and he is even more excited about the opportunity to roll up his sleeves and get to work at this unique business.","As for me I'm very pleased to remain on Align's board where I will do my best to help Align flourish for many years to come. I thank you for your commitment to the company as shareholders. For your own sense of vision about what this one struggling Silicon Valley startup could become. I've enjoyed getting to know many of you and I've done my best in leading our team as we build substantial shareholder value. And on a happy note when I'll be signing off as your CEO in a month or so, before you let me out of here I guess have a few questions for David and me and the quarter and for Joe at what he saw to attract him here to Align. Let's get that started, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from the line of John Kreger with William Blair, please proceed with your question.","John Kreger","Could you maybe give us, as Tom suggested, a little bit of what drove your decision to join this company? It's obviously a pretty different profile from where you've been. And if you've formed them, perhaps what your first year priorities might be?","Joe Hogan","Hi John appreciate the question, look I'm really happy to be here, I mean Align is a great company, is a great history and good leadership and team here. I think your question to I know it's smaller than what I've done in the last maybe 10 years or 12 years of my career, but honestly gentlemen I've always have always been close to customers, I love technology, growth in markets and customers always have been terrific for me too and so I look at this a chance from a career standpoint to join a winning team, a company that has a lot of growth and also to do more of the things I really enjoy which is technology piece and the customer piece too, so I'm really looking forward to joining the company, I think the last part of our question is, look I see a terrific trajectory here and a strong team, I don't see any reason to change that. So I come on board, I'll take over the plant here and work diligently with the team to keep the momentum that Align's had over the last couple of years.","John Kreger","And then Tom, maybe coming back to you, now that you've got the Sirona interoperability deal in place, can you give us a sense about what does your sales force -- what are they able to do now that they've got that? Can they work collaboratively with Sirona or Patterson? Can they be knocking on the doors of existing CEREC users? How much might their approach change now that that deal is in place?","Tom Prescott","Great question and I think the right touchstone is to remember that's the Omnicam starting with a pretty darn small install base to begin with and mostly all GP dentists and most of which do not do Invisalign today, so it does give us an opportunity to recruit, great attractive practices or if they're small Invisalign customers you need to grow them but we're talking small number of thousands of units not the bigger part of the Sirona install base. Longer term Sirona is a terrific company they're doing a great job and I think they intentionally turned their install base over to Omnicam\u2019s more and that will make that opportunity bigger but let\u2019s just say start small and do the same things we\u2019ve done with 3M True Definition, ensure that the customer has the best utility possible and we can make sure we deliver our great Invisalign experience help the practice grow, help the patients benefit, so same approach, we'll just keep moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs, please bear with your questions.","Robert Jones ","Thanks for the questions and welcome, Joe. I look forward to working with you. Tom, I guess, on the strong growth in cases in the quarter, clearly really strong in both the GPs and Orthos in North America. I think third and fourth quarters have accelerating growth consecutively respectively. Can you maybe just share with us how much of that in your mind is the improving underlying market versus you said some early traction in the go-to-market strategy changes?","Tom Prescott","I'd say yes. I don't mean to be flip but I wish we could be very clear about exactly what the quantitative drivers were, we know that when practice flow is steady and perhaps growing a little bit and procedures, procedure mix is positive for higher value procedures we do better than most and we certainly I would say steady to improving conditions as we exited '14 and went into '15. Secondly and I'll reach back to our call at the end of year, we were already in motion on most of these initiatives both on the consumer side and the product side and on a go to market side so while we think of this model generally as more backend loaded for impact in leverage we were already seeing some positive feedback from customer in Q3 and Q4 as we started to making these changes. A better coverage, more effective coverage, better support for the practices generally means could things happen. So it\u2019s early and it\u2019s way too early to call victory here. But we think our improving capabilities and better coverage alongside solid market is good news. We still project continued impact throughout the year as we normally see.","Robert Jones","So it sounds like a combination of improving markets and some of your efforts then.","Tom Prescott","I think that\u2019s fair.","Robert Jones","And then I guess just sticking with North America but moving over to pricing, ASPs were down a little more than we had expected at least. I\u2019m just curious how much leeway are you giving out there to the reps in the marketplace to drive some volume through pricing or through promotions?","Tom Prescott","Well, put this clearly I\u2019ll let David come to ASPs specifics. We have series of program the reps have no attitude at deals or anything else. We have a very organized system of promotions we put in place usually a quarter or two in advance and those are fairly consistent and we have the advantage program which is the way we basically manage price. So there is no kind of field based management of this per say, I\u2019ll let David maybe talk about some mix and few other issues that contributed to some of that ASP, none of which in our mind is negative.","David White ","Rob, ASPs on a worldwide basis for the quarter were primarily influenced by foreign exchange so we continue to believe that as we treat more complex cases as our international business continues to grow we believe that our worldwide ASP should trend slightly up over the foreseeing future. Periodically we are going to see little volatility in that from quarter-to-quarter basis just depend upon how that mix land. This last quarter our international business is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter seasonally and so as a result our ASPs that we typically sell under here in North America influence that worldwide number a little bit more in what they would have otherwise.","Robert Jones","Okay, so the North American then was orchestrated through some of the specific targeted promotional activity it sounds like.","David White ","We only disclose what the North America ASPs were so I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re backing into that. But we didn\u2019t do anything fundamentally to change ASPs here in North America during the quarter. ","Tom Prescott","If I can pile on for a second, if you think about that for minute we had great expansion in ortho and some kind of say new improving traction with GP. When we get more high volume doctors do more volume through the Advantage program, you\u2019re going to see a little that in ASP. There was also a little bit of mix on the Express side, Express shift, Express mix stayed steady but little more in Express 5. But in general nothing unusual going on and all the directions are good.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve Beuchaw ","First off, Joe, welcome to the call and thanks for taking the time to join. ","Joe Hogan","Thanks Steve. ","Steve Beuchaw ","And Tom, in case this is my last opportunity, thanks for everything that you have done. ","Tom Prescott","Great, Steve it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you I\u2019m sure see you around.","Steve Beuchaw ","Hopefully in San Francisco in a few weeks?","Tom Prescott","Absolutely, there you go.","Steve Beuchaw","I guess I\u2019ll start with Tom and a question following up to the question on the Sirona relationship as we think about how that rolls out over the next year or so. I wonder what you are hearing thus far, whether it\u2019s from your planning team or from the field, about how customers might take advantage of the scanner. We know in the orthodontics channel that people who have iTero, they tend to do more cases. So how are you thinking about the impact on GP customers who might have an Omnicam but not an iTero? How could their utilization evolve and how does that play out over time? ","Tom Prescott","Well, it goes right to the point of why we are pursuing this open systems approach within our operability. One is channel have to be capable, each of our partners have had to go into investing into software and tuning their systems to work with what the very prescribed for Invisalign and the Omnicam has met that standard and they rollout their 1.1 software we\u2019ll be able to get cases. What we would expect is whether there are low volume Invisalign user today having to do impressions PBS impressions to sent it in, that are to be a positive. Very few GPs and especially a bigger office using CEREC for example is doing a huge amount of Invisalign because they\u2019ve got such busy practice already. So we\u2019re in addition to their practice we are not mean the main street part of their practice. This gives them an opportunity to me way more efficient to lower their cost and for the patient to be a whole lot happier.","All of those things point to increase utilization. The result is never is significant as when you have a very high volume ortho that nearly switches over the scanners where it really removes friction, it\u2019s very visible. So it does give us a great hunting license to go earn a bigger share of mine and share of practice being in more relevant and that\u2019s the case whether it\u2019s iTero or that\u2019s the case whether it\u2019s definition 3M\u2019s True Definition, and it will be the case for Omnicam. So I think overtime our commitment is to work with each of these other players to ensure that we can deliver that great customers experience where patients are happy, docs are happy, we do that right we're going to get increased adoption growth in each of these accounts overtime.","Steve Beuchaw","And then one for Joe, I don't think anyone can expect you to have much in the way of specifics for how you want to operate at Align at this point. But I wonder if you can reflect on your past experience with regard to building a business, a combination of organic growth and acquisitive growth, and maybe give us a sense for how you at least philosophically think about the balance there. If you have any preferences or criteria that you use to think about for capital allocation by M&A and how you think about share buybacks for a company like Align that is such a strong generator of cash? Thanks.","Joe Hogan","I see that can read through your question and I've done a lot of M&A in my life and I'm sometimes labeled as an M&A person but I can tell you that I've only done that in the sense of looking at what organic growth is in different businesses I've been in and 10 to 1 I\u2019d rather grow organically than look at acquisitions. But every role that I've been in whether it was running businesses within GE or most recently ABB, I don't really come in with a playbook, I come in and just see what the company does well and where it might need help, assess the team and understand the team and the strength of that team and then figure out how to grow and how to operate well and so I don't really have a playbook in that sense I think that if you go back to my history and I know several people out there contacted some of my friends and different people which I appreciate you get an idea from them rather directly from me but indirectly from them how they felt about working with me or for me and hopefully you'll hear that.","So honestly I come in here I see a team that has an incredible track record a tremendous leadership like Tom, a business that has incredible potential in a lot of ways, whether it's scale or through additional technology and some of the things that David and Tom just talked about and I look to see how we can enhance that and obviously as I start and look at the company I'll get out and see customers, meet as much the company as I can and then from there we'll figure out what we need to do to grow more and what makes more sense.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Lewis of ROTH Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lewis","I just wanted to start on the gross margins. And I may have missed it but it looks like it came in about 300 basis points above your outlook. So can you elaborate on what drove the upside for gross margin during the quarter in the face of FX headwinds? And then as you look into the second quarter, what are the factors that are leading to your expectation for a sequential decline in gross margin in the second quarter?","Tom Prescott","So one of the phenomena about our business has to do with the training events that go on from period-to-period and in periods when we have more training events than other periods our margins tend to fluctuate in the down direction or in the up direction, depends on whether those training events are increasing or decreasing. And so when you look from Q4 to Q1 the training events were down in Q1 and we\u2019re anticipating they're going to back up in Q2. And that certainly has some influence on it, when you look at the Q2 guidance part of it is foreign exchange rates have moved another five points on us since the last, well since Q1 average and so that has obviously some bearing on the margin guidance with we gave for Q2.","David White","But Chris if I could add that we had increased volumes in the business, we had good performance of management of direct cost by the team, so we've seen where we put volume in this business it shows up in a variety of ways.","Chris Lewis ","And then in terms of the high teen volume growth outlook you provided on the last call, 17% year-over-year volume growth this quarter, 18% guided to the midpoint next quarter, can you just talk about how you're feeling you're tracking towards that high teen volume growth outlook at this point, given your already kind of there in the first and second quarter and you talked about further impact from the North American go to market approach on the back half of this year.","Tom Prescott","David's the one providing the guidance I'll turn it over to him but I'll start by saying that all the elements we talked about that we tested during fiscal year '14 and pretty much had in place. We were getting good feedback and we said it was very early in the year at the end of January to see but we\u2019re getting good feedback from customers that they felt that coverage had improved, our responsiveness was improving, we were in better position to help them be successful in their practices I'd say the maturation of things like deep bite and some of the initiatives we've been working on for a while, all those things kind of start to come together with a great consumer program so pleased that there are innovation cycle, coverage and go-to-market adjustments around the world and now in North America a little more, and consumer programs kind of work together and again actually the back drop is reasonably healthy market but we've been reasonably comfortable that we're on the right track, again the tide can go out a little bit but I think we're going to do better than most, I'll David come back and comment specifically on the framework he provided for the year.","David White","Yes, so Chris when we gave the framework back in January and so forth we had obviously a lot of lifting to do against the foreign exchange headwinds and so forth we had a lot of investments we were making to hopefully drive top line in not only the long term but certainly in the short term and you may recall in our comments I think we might even have mentioned something that effect here early in the call that we expect to see more of our growth coming in the second half of the year. Some of those investments we can take hold. So as we think about the year in totality we feel like we gotten up to a great start and sitting April feeling good about that but we also know we have a lot of works still got ahead of us to deliver the full year results that we give you the outlook on just couple of months ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening, guys, and welcome Joe and Tom. Hopefully I\u2019ll catch you in San Francisco in a couple weeks like some of the others. ","Tom Prescott","Perfect.","Jeff Johnson","I wanted to start, Joe, you made a comment that some of us have been out there checking on you and one of the labels that gets put on you is maybe an M&A focus. One of the other labels, if I want to phrase it that way, is that you may be a very cost-conscious or cost-focused kind of guy as well. Maybe that stems obviously from your GE Healthcare days. But just in general, how do you think about costs? And you\u2019re running obviously the growth company a West Coast based growth company. Any comments you could make on that side of the story?","Tom Prescott","Jeff, that\u2019s a really good question. In my career I have had to understand the operations and be part of operations or whatever. One of the reason I\u2019m here is because I love growth and I love businesses have potential to grow and obviously investment in growth is really important thing I think when you listen to Tom and David I smile because you can see good input and output ratio in the sense what investments are being made here and the consequential growth you can get in about very shorter period of time. And so it\u2019s hopefully you can see in the sense of the business that works and I like things that work in the business and what leadership pull and how things work.","Secondly from a cost standpoint I am a guy who want to understand cost and make sure that we do make investments that they are good investments you just don\u2019t take that for granted and you also need to diligent around cost really understand where it\u2019s going in. And often from a portfolio standpoint you might want to make some move something from part of the business and other part so you actually growing more. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a liability at all that I understand operations and enjoy operations but look at in the sense of just from the standpoint of cost saving cost. It\u2019s just an allocation of capital and resources and where that best goes in the business in the point in time.","Jeff Johnson","It does. Very helpful as well, thank you, David, one question for you and I\u2019ll take kind of maybe the opposite side of Bob\u2019s question earlier. On ASPs, the sequential decline of $35 was actually less than we were thinking it was going to be; the decline was less. So ASPs came in a bit above what we were thinking. And you said 90% of that was currency. When I look at the GP number, GP up 6.5% was a decently good number, better than it\u2019s been, but stacked comps still got a little slower. So I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, you had a sizable Express 5 promotion in place this quarter. Has that just not generated the traction yet? Should we think about kind of the acceleration off that promotion kind of coming more in Q2 and I would assume that would then impact the ASPs a little bit more in 2Q over the 1Q as well?","Tom Prescott","It\u2019s specifically Jeff regarding the Express promotion we implemented that in the middle of the quarter and then you have to recognize that it\u2019s going to take a while before doctors are going to get engage with that promotion it\u2019s going to take a while for them to get patients in the seat to get them to treatment planning. Get treatment planning approved. Fabricate the aligners et cetera. So we only saw a small impact of Express 5 really during Q1. We are continuing that promotion in the Q2. So to the extent that has some impact on ASPs we think it will be relatively modest and I\u2019d say the other thing is that objective with the Express 5 promotion is to drive adoption and we kind of view the Express 5 promotion as a way to increase the bonds that we would otherwise done as a company in any of that. So we see Express 5 promotion really as incremental. To the extent it was widely successful which we certainly hope for. That would have some impact on ASPs but we\u2019re not expecting it to be that meaningful.","Jeff Johnson ","Understood.","Tom Prescott","If I add to that I\u2019ll point you back to what I said earlier, this is about really getting progress in regular adoption by the course customer group we want Orthos and GPs that have made a big part of their practice and when that happen they get a little better pricing. There is little more of our total volume going to advantage and we would expect the little bit of them move on ASP down. So that\u2019s a really good of that because we\u2019re most efficient covering those customers versus bringing a very low volume customer along with a very low leverage in the go-to market model. So we\u2019ve always been very willing to have that volume impact for fairly modest ASP decline. So that\u2019s in more mindset progress.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. I got it. Not a criticism of the program at all. Just wanted to check when the impact would come down.","Tom Prescott","Didn\u2019t take it that way just trying to be clear.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Block","I\u2019ll preface this by saying, trying to be clear not that I\u2019m complaining, but when the company [indiscernible] when you guys complete those case volumes in conjunction with Tom\u2019s retirement, if I remember correctly, that was at the very end of March. I think like the 25th or the 26th. And sort of the wording in that release would have implied around 127,000, 128,000 1Q cases. You did close t o 131. I mean the way your revenue model works, the quarter was closed back then. So I'm just asking, David, I guess this one's for you. Can you explain that discrepancy? And then Tom, as a function of that, maybe if you can comment on intra-quarter trends that you saw and more specifically how you exited March and April?","Tom Prescott","I'm going to get in front of David for one reason, this was not a going away gift for me, this is the way the business evolves in trying to meet customer needs, it's really-really simple and the way the volume flowed through the quarter was pretty linear but it was just -- to meet our kind of, our standard requirements we wanted to get those cases out. We're not trying to micromanage that and again we had some work to do while we were coming out with this news on me, I'll let David talk.","David White","I think the press release, I don't know the exact wording in it, Jon but I think it said we expected to be slightly above the high-end of our range and I guess you can define what slightly means but you know the only other alternative would have been to put a number out there and we just didn\u2019t feel that was the right thing to do but you know I think we gave you the best guidance we could in terms of the appropriateness of what we put in the press release before we're ready to close out the financials and talk about it a few weeks later.","Jon Block","Fair enough and again, not that I'm complaining. Question two, if I can just have sort of a call it part A and part B. The first one, part A, David, longer-term, that 25% to 30% sort of three- to five-year op margin goal, should we think about that and normalize for FX? And I know you don't want that sort of a moving target and floating daily to currencies, but that should be down maybe 200 to 300 basis points from when you gave that last year at the analyst day. So should we think of that more 22% to 27%, or how should we flow that through our model? And then Tom, the B is I'm sort of trying end our interaction with a difficult question. On the Sirona deal, which still, in my opinion, came two years too late, but to dig deeper, why not make that exclusive and have something where you have a payment flowing from you guys to Sirona so when you fast-forward three years, they can't sign up a DENTSPLY or a Danaher and lock up that volume on Invisalign's platform. Thank you guys.","David White","I think that's a four part question Jon, let me start first with the whole logic for being in open systems. Simply stated it's better for our customers. No one wants to have to redesign, start over, buy multiple pieces of equipment if they can have greatest utility from a scanner by the way, with this open systems we still sell more standalone scanner than anybody else, so we're doing pretty well even as we're opening up Invisalign which would be an advantage for our iTero team to sell our own scanner so we believe what we hear from our customers is they don't want to be forced to buy a system from you for the pleasure of offering Invisalign to their patients and other therapies we may have down the road, so we feel actually very strongly.","To the point of paying Sirona this is really about value creation right for our customer, most buyers of scanners say they want to make sure the scanner can do a therapy like Invisalign so if anybody was going to pay it ought to be the other way around and to exclusivity we think that if everybody brings a different story to the market you know Sirona has a great product offering with the stored up dentistry, Patterson carries a lot of products, they're focused for that. There's no reason, we don\u2019t really directly compete with them there's no reason for us not to act in complementary ways because it's good for the customer, so in our minds we don't need to own the channel we don\u2019t to have exclusivity in fact we want probably more high quality scanners that can make it easier to do Invisalign and other chair side procedures that we have unique capability to fulfill. So I think, well I'd point to the opposite direction there's more benefit from giving a customer what they want at a lower cost and great utility over time than anything else.","Jon Block","Fair enough and David can I get you to comment on the 3-5 year margin guidance?","David White","So Jon our operating model that we\u2019ve been targeting and striving to achieve for some time, it's certainly influenced by a lot of variables, FX being just one of them, we still -- and I think we demonstrated the leverage we get out of our business model in the last year 2014 being the first year that we actually landed results inside that model. And so we do get leverage from growth and growth is the best strategy for growing out of the headwinds we're getting from FX. And so while those headwinds may set us back a little bit while we try and readjust our business and so forth, I think the great thing about our business is the fact that it's growing and as we continue to grow particularly on the international side we believe we can grow out of those currency headwinds so we don't see any reason to update our model, I think it's still, it\u2019s a long term model, it's still aspirational in some respects and we still feel pretty strongly about the potential of the business to grow into again even with the headwinds.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks. Tom and David, last quarter, we spent a fair amount of time talking about some of the incremental investments that you plan to make around areas of sleep apnea, the new ERP system, some of the North American sales people. And at that time, you gave some pretty specific details around that and the potential impacts it might have on margin. Maybe could you give us a little bit of an update there, maybe give us a sense for maybe how much you might have spent in those areas this quarter and what you\u2019re forecasting to spend in the second quarter?","Tom Prescott","Glen I don\u2019t know I really got an update for your I think when we gave the outlook for the year and as you see our first quarter results and our guidance for Q2 I think you can see the uplift in our operating expenses I think you can assume that most of that uplift has to do with new investments. We talk about sleep apnea in Q1. We talked about the investments in the sales force in go-to-market coverage et cetera. Those investments are all P&L investments. So I think it\u2019s pretty transparent when you look at our Q1 results and our guidance that those investments are proceedings as we indicated and I think they will continue to proceed throughout the balance of the year as we continue to plant seeds for the future direction and the growth of business.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. That\u2019s fine. Maybe if I can just ask Joe a question. Joe, it kind of sounds like you\u2019re excited about a bunch of the opportunities that you see, but what one of the issues that\u2019s been on investors\u2019 minds is around intellectual property and the expiration of some of the patents in 2017 and 2018. And so I\u2019m kind of curious. Could you maybe share with us how much due diligence you did around this IP issue, and how maybe you got comfortable with this issue when considering taking the position?","Tom Prescott","Glen it\u2019s a good question honestly my due diligence was almost with a huge receive from Top and rest of the team and looking at what\u2019s going on. If you look at the R&D investment the number of patterns and -- if you look at the sequential technology capability that Align is really shown to these investments starting with relatively simple kind of liners through the years becoming more and more capable of doing more difficult cases I think shows that overall the initial exploration was patterns in two years forward, just more through this in just a couple of patterns coming off respect to this success here almost been done. So obviously, in my life, I have been associated with lot IP particularly with GE Medical and GE Healthcare. I understand the impact of customer preference also market channeling, skill, all of those things as it relates to IP2. When I look at Align I see there is much more going on here than just a pattern coming off over the next couple years and this sets the momentum with the opportunities to -- that\u2019s not in the gate what that might need from the competitive standpoint that everyone has competition, competition should make you better and company should be able to respond in that too and I think Align has shown that they can do that. As I take over for Tom and we work as a team. We\u2019ll continue to focus on customers. We\u2019ll continue to invest in R&D. We continue to scale globally and I think that\u2019s going to help that whole equation a lot.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thanks for the comments. ","Tom Prescott","Thanks Glen. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question please.","Operator","Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Jeffrey Matthews at Ram Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Jeffrey Matthews","Hi. Can you hear me?","Tom Prescott","Hi Jeff, yes.","Jeffrey Matthews ","Hi. Joe, I just want to say I look forward to meeting you. My old pal Nat Kingman speaks very highly of you. And Tom, I don\u2019t want to offend any of the sports fans on the call, but I feel like I did when Mariano Rivera retired from the Yankees. Very sad, but very appreciative of his track record and I just want to say congratulations and great good luck. You deserve all good things.","Tom Prescott","Very nice of you to say, I appreciate it.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan, Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments: clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","I'm pleased to report another better than expected quarter for Align. Our second quarter results reflect strong growth across our customer channels with record volume in all regions and almost every country market. Year-over-year revenue growth of 37.5% was driven by continued momentum from Invisalign doctors and increased adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenage patients which grew 42.1%.","Q2 Invisalign volume growth of 30.5% year-over-year reflects increased utilization and expansion of our customer base which was over 50,000 for the first time and included more than 5,000 new Invisalign trained doctors. We also saw momentum from the iTero scanner and services business which includes the continued rollout of iTero scanners across Heartland Dental's supported offices as well as the first iTero scanner shipments to China.","Turning to specifics around our second quarter results, let's start with results of our Americas region. For the Americas, Q2 was a good quarter with Invisalign case volume up 8.9% sequentially and 22.2% year-over-year reflecting growth in both our orthodontic and also GP dentist channels. In Q2, we trained 1,795 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 640 were in Latin America alone, where we trained more doctors in the first half of this year than we did all of last year.","For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by orthodontist customers with another record quarter for North American ortho utilization at 16.4 cases per doctor. Q2 Invisalign utilization for North American GP dentist were also up year-over-year at 3.6 cases per doctor reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base which represented over 20,000 GPs for the first time in a quarter.","For international doctors, Q2 was another strong growth with Invisalign case volume up 14.9% sequentially and 45.4% year-over-year, reflecting strong Invisalign volume across the board driven by both increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base. For Q2, we're continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,650 newly trained doctors in EMEA.","Year-over-year growth of Invisalign volume in EMEA was up 38% with a record quarter in all geographies as well as the teenage segment which was up 72% year-over-year. We also saw growth across our key expansion markets, led by Central and Eastern Europe. In May, we announced a grand opening of our first Invisalign treatment planning facility in Europe located in Cologne, Germany.","Until recently, Invisalign treatment planning for EMEA doctors was conducted in Align's treatment planning facility in Costa Rica. The Cologne facility will also serve as a training facility for Invisalign doctors with a German speaking market providing clinical education and support in local language. In September, we'll host a grand opening of our new treatment planning facility in Madrid, Spain which will serve the Iberia market.","In APAC, Q2 Invisalign volumes were up 58.7% year-over-year led by China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. Our Q2 results reflect continued strong growth overall and especially from teen cases which were up 74.3% year-over-year. China continues to drive the majority of growth in the Asia-Pacific region and we are increasingly leveraging digital and social media marketing programs.","Japan also had a strong year-over-year Invisalign growth, driven primarily by orthodontists as well as continued uplift from iTero scanners. In addition, GP dentist channel in APAC was up 77.9% compared to last year. Q2 was all-time high for Invisalign volume in our smaller expansion markets in Thailand and India which are still very early in their development and adoption cycle.","Now turning to the teen market, in Q2, 78,400 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 13.6% sequentially and 42.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, led by North American orthodontists. Q2 was a seventh consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volumes grew faster than adults reflecting a shift toward younger teens and tweens.","For Q2, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American Orthos increased 30% and international doctors were up 73%. One of the key drivers behind our strong growth is continued product innovation. On July 1, we launched a new Invisalign Go product with a more user-friendly iTero digital chairside experience and greater flexibility to treat a wider range of mild to moderate cases such as crowded or gap teeth that require teeth straightening prior to restorative treatments.","Invisalign Go also incorporates new data-driven clinical protocols for predictable tooth movement and automated case assessments which will make it easier for dentists to tailor the treatments and plans to the individual needs of each patient. We're very excited about the potential for Invisalign Go to help accelerate adoption among GP dentists worldwide.","As we aim to create even greater preference for Invisalign treatment from doctors and consumers alike, especially in the teen market, a key factor is expanding clinically applicability of the Invisalign system in order to treat more complex cases. The launch of Mandibular Advancement feature last year has continued to ramp up and help drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among teenage patients in EMEA and APAC. Mandibular Advancement feature is pending FDA approval in the U.S. and we continue to expect approval in the second half of this year.","On July 1, we began offering Invisalign First, designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of eruption dentition and predictable dental arch expansion. While it's only been a few weeks, the initial response to Invisalign First has been very positive and excitement among top Invisalign doctors is rising and we're on a path to reach 1,000 Invisalign First cases across all regions in the first month alone.","The $100 million investment we make each year in consumer marketing programs include TV, digital, social media, PR, event marketing and more recently, our Concierge service and Invisalign store pilot. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.","In Q2, we continue to successfully leverage the Made to Move campaign we kicked off last year, which is our first fully integrated global consumer marketing campaign launched across all major markets. We also continued to build on regional programs like Teen and Mom campaign in North America and launched an entirely new initiative in APAC called Asian Smile in May.","We have included the key indicators from our consumer marketing programs in the Q2 earnings slides posted on our website, so I won't go through them on this call. Needless to say, all metrics for tracking consumer interest are up with strong growth in Invisalign website visitors across APAC and opt-ins in the Americas region, which captures consumers who take an action on our website and give us permission to contact them directly.","Our Smile Concierge program that we launched over a year ago is continuing to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment by shortening their research cycle and connecting them with an active Invisalign doctor. Year-to-date we scheduled over 30,000 Invisalign consultations in the U.S. which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign doctors every day.","Concierge service is also equipping us with valuable consumer insights that help our doctors better engage with consumers in their practices and online. It's been very exciting to see how Invisalign doctors are working to reflect these insights and connect more effectively with the consumers that we send them every day.","The Smile Concierge service is also expanding outside the U.S. with teams in Singapore, Brazil, Australia, and most recently the UK. And while it's still early, each of these countries are seeing great initial traction and helping more consumers become Invisalign patients.","Sole purpose of the Invisalign store is to connect new potential patients with Invisalign doctors in their offices by raising awareness of Invisalign treatment and removing some common barriers for consumers to get started. Our experience with the stores continues to evolve and grow and we are learning a lot from our consumers and participating doctors.","To-date, the Invisalign stores have contributed to a significant influx of consumer interest in the San Jose and San Francisco orthodontic marketplace. Over 8,000 consumers have visited our Align (sic) [Invisalign] stores. The average participating doctor in the store network has received dozens of scanned consumers, with the top providers easily receiving over 150 consumers.","Many doctors have said the Invisalign stores have far surpassed their top referral sources. Earlier this month, we opened two new Invisalign stores in Bethesda, Maryland and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. And we're excited to see the impact these pilots will have on the participating Invisalign practices in the area. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these pilot locations and we'll update you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year.","In Q2, iTero revenues were up 10.9% sequentially as we saw benefit from the launch of iTero Element 2 and Element Flex, as well as the first commercial shipments of Element scanners in China. In April, we received China FDA approval to sell iTero Element in China. And, today, we announced that we have received regulatory approval to manufacture iTero Element in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China.","Year-over-year Q2 scanner revenues were up 60.9%, reflecting very strong growth across all regions and reflects the continued trend toward an end-to-end digital workflow starting with an iTero scanner on the front-end. Not only do Invisalign doctors with an iTero scanner have notably higher utilization rates than non-iTero doctors, but it also enables greater efficiency between precision dentistry and higher overall customer experience and satisfaction.","Our dental service organizations or DSO partners have recognized the strategic fit of the iTero scanners and are adopting the platform across their business. In Q2, Heartland Dental continued to rollout iTero scanners across their U.S. supported locations and plan to have scanners in 90% of supported offices by the end of the year. Similarly, Aspen Dental will begin to rollout iTero scanners to their customer base over the next two quarters beginning in Q3.","Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impression continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to a record 69.3%, up from 67.3% in Q1. International scans increased 47.3%, up from 43.2% in Q1.","Finally, in the Doctor-Directed at Home Channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub or SDC. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners which are non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q2, shipments to SDC were up sequentially and higher than expected. In April, SDC filed a complaint alleging that the launch and operation of Align's Invisalign Store Pilot program constitutes a breach of non-compete provisions applicable to the members of SDC Financial LLC, including Align.","On June 29, 2018, the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, denied SDC's Entities' request for temporary injunction to prevent us from opening additional Invisalign stores. As you heard earlier, we will continue to open additional Invisalign stores as part of our pilot program designed to connect consumers interested in Invisalign treatment with Invisalign-trained doctors in their offices.","We continue to dispute the allegations that we have breached our obligations to the SDC Entities under applicable law and will oppose any with a vigorous defend ourselves in the arbitration proceedings currently scheduled for December 2018. As it relates the SDC, we believe working with them was a way to influence and shape the evolving consumer market for clear aligners. Our objective was and still is to reach consumers who would not otherwise consider orthodontic treatment and connect them with Invisalign doctors in their offices.","Our relationship with SDC has not worked out as expected. We have not been able to impact the decision-making process at SDC we had hoped and transfer the out-of-scope patients to an Invisalign doctor's office has not scaled as we had hoped. We do not anticipate renewing our supply agreement with SDC when it expires in 2019.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total company revenue for the second quarter was a record $490.3 million, up 12.2% from the prior quarter and up 37.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. Clear Aligner revenue of $433.2 (sic) [$433.3] (16:21) million was up 12.4% sequentially on higher than expected volume. Year-over-year Clear Aligner revenue growth of 35% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign ASPs.","Q2 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $5 from Q1 to $1,315, reflecting increased secondary revenue and favorable price (sic) [product] (16:50) mix, partially offset by unfavorable FX and sales promotions. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $30, reflecting favorable FX, price increases, and product mix, partially offset by sales promotions and deferrals related to additional aligners.","For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 302.7 thousand cases were up 11.2% sequentially and up 30.5% year-over-year, driven by growth across all regions. For Americas orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 9% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 8.6% sequentially and up 18.2% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 14.9% sequentially and up 45.4% year-over-year.","Our Scanner & Services revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, up 10.9% sequentially due to increased ASP benefiting from Element 2 and Element Flex product launches and the first Elements shipped into China. Year-over-year revenue was up 60.9%, primarily due to higher volume, product mix, and higher scanner ASPs.","Moving onto gross margin, second quarter overall gross margin was 74.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.5%, down 0.5 points sequentially, primarily due to costs from the regional expansion of our manufacturing operation and increased aligners per case. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 1.6 points year-over-year, primarily due to regional expansion of our manufacturing activities and increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher worldwide ASPs.","Scanner gross margin for the second quarter was 59.6%, up 0.4 points sequentially due to higher scanner ASPs, partially offset by higher production variances and freight cost. Scanner gross margins were up 2.9 points year-over-year primarily due to higher scanner ASPs along with increased manufacturing efficiencies.","Q2 operating expenses were $242.9 million, up sequentially 6% and up 29.6% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our go-to-market activities, including higher advertising spending, geographic expansion, as well as increased compensation related to expenses due to higher head count.","Our second quarter operating income was $122.7 million, up 25% sequentially and up 46.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating margin was 25%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily due to volume leverage and operating expense efficiencies. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects leveraged operating expenses on higher revenues from both Clear Aligner and Scanner & Services, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates.","With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 6.6%, which includes the impact of $16.6 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.30, up $0.13 sequentially and up $0.45 compared to the prior year.","Moving onto the balance sheet. As of the second quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $720.7 million. This compared to $673 million at the end of Q1, an increase of approximately $47.7 million, primarily due to increased collections and working capital improvements. Of our $720.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, $338.1 million was held in the U.S. and $382.6 million was held by our international entities.","Q2 accounts receivable balance was $374.4 million, up approximately 3.6% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, or DSOs, was 68 days, down 6 days sequentially and down 6 days from 74 days in Q2 last year. Our Q2 DSO is down sequentially as a result of improvements in both collections and AR aging.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $57.7 million, primarily related to increased aligner capacity and facilities. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $139.8 million, up $29.3 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $82.1 million.","During the second quarter, we also announced a new $600 million stock buyback authorization. As of June 30, 2018, we have $100 million remaining under the April 2016 repurchase program that we expect to utilize during the remainder of 2018.","With that, let's turn to our Q3 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to grow on a sequential basis as the APAC market is going into their strong teen season, offset somewhat by EMEA market going into their summer seasonality. For Americas, we expect North America to grow on strong teen demand, offset somewhat by seasonally slower adult season. LATAM will be flat on a sequential basis due to their summer holiday.","We started selling iTero Element in China in Q2 of 2018. Additionally, Align has been effectively growing its iTero business in the North America DSO market. We expect a sequential increase in iTero units recognized as a result of these go-to-market activities. We continue to expect SmileDirectClub volume to be minimal in the third quarter. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows.","Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 302,000 to 307,000 cases, up approximately 28% to 30% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q3 revenues to be in the range of $493 million to $503 million, an increase of approximately 28% to 31% year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74% to 74.4%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning and manufacturing operations, partially offset by higher ASPs.","We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $245 million to $249 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go-to-market activities. Q3 operating margins should be in the range of 24.2% to 24.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 21%.","We expect approximately $1.5 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.18. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q3 to be approximately $60 million to $65 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10 million to $11 million.","Now let me turn to our view of 2018. Based on the momentum in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low to mid-30s. We expect Invisalign revenue and volume to be in the low 30s. Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we expect operating margin for the full year to be slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John, and thanks to those of you for joining our call today. 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for Align, which reflects the continued execution of our four strategic goals and growth drivers that we focus on driving international expansion; increasing orthodontist utilization of Invisalign, especially with teenagers; enabling GP dentists to treat or refer more Invisalign cases; and generating consumer demand for Invisalign treatment for millions of people worldwide.","We are pleased to see continued momentum across all of our regions and customer channels and believe that the investments we are making will continue to drive our growth well above the underlying industry. There is still a lot of work to be done to fully optimize the enormous market potential, but we remain steadfast in our vision to bring clear aligner orthodontics to the masses through our partnership with Invisalign doctors.","I look forward to updating you on our continued progress. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll open the call up to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. Maybe the first one just on the guidance, certainly solid 3Q guidance, but curious if you can talk about at a high level what that allows for if anything from the incremental competition? In other words, you guys always seem to be a bit conservative on the guide. Are you even leaving a bit more wiggle room due to the unknown uptake around SureSmile and Clarity? And maybe just as a follow-on to that one, what if anything, Joe, have you heard about these offerings over the past few months since the ortho show? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jon. This is John. I'll start with the first part of your question. We guide like we always guide taking the best information that we have. No change in terms of how we've taken this guidance. So we factor in many different factors into our forecast and this is no different from a guidance standpoint.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jon. And from a competitive standpoint, there's nothing really different than what we saw from an AAO standpoint. I mean, obviously, you saw the Clarity product from Ormco that came out in Australia here recently. From what we see, there's again \u2013 it's just in line with other offerings that we see out there. And we'll take a stronger beat on that in the future. But right now I wouldn't say we have changed in any way our assessment of the competition that we saw at the AAO.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then the follow up, I'm going to put you a little bit on the gross margin trend. So, I know the long-term of 73% to 78% appears unchanged but the 2Q Invisalign gross margin is 76.5%. In my model, it's one of the lowest in the past handful of years. And guys maybe if we can talk about how that trends over the next 12 months. You talked about some of the deterioration being attributable to globalizing the supply chain. So do we think about, hey, as volumes start to go through those sites in coming quarters, maybe we see the GM specific to Invisalign stabilize and maybe even possibly reverse that trend? Thanks.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","That's right, Jon. As we're investing and globalizing, we think it's a long-term strategic importance to us. We'll see some of those investments. But as we add capacity and as we add production in those facilities, we'll see some improvement. And you also have to remember too we had a lot of \u2013 from a mix standpoint a lot of iTero in Q2. So the Q2 iTero affects us from a gross margin standpoint. But, as you know, it's a part of our long-term strategy and important for us from a growth standpoint.","Operator","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Jon.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Jon.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just a few on the Aspen deal and the DSO opportunity, more broadly. I guess, maybe, Joe, or John, could you share how this deal came about? And, more importantly, would you be willing to share anything around any economic structure around the arrangement, if there's any kind of commitments or targets with Aspen? And then, Joe, if I heard you correctly I think you said that Heartland expects to have 90% of their practices within iTero by the end of the year. Curious if you'd maybe be willing to share how the Invisalign growth or uptake has tracked at Heartland as we think about that as a proxy for Aspen?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. First, on the Aspen deal and the Heartland deal, just from a high level standpoint is I think you know we've had a really strong GP focus in this business. But it's difficult at times to have an individual just focus on accounts and to drive the kind of penetration in the marketplace that we want. We find that DSOs are great partners for us in the sense of their ability to be able to spread what we want to do with our digital workflow and with our aligners across their base. And so, Heartland and Aspen both have been very open in the sense of working with us and frontloading their businesses with iTero that will allow them to \u2013 give them a very strong position in clear aligners. And so that's \u2013 it's just right in line with our GP strategy and it allows us to be able to multiply that strategy across a number of different locations with the DSOs that really help us.","We've been working with Heartland for a while on clear aligners and their uptake of iTero scanners have been great. Our growth with Heartland has really been terrific. And they've been able to translate it across their organizations well. We haven't shared a whole lot of numbers in the sense of how that's going and we won't. That's how we want to handle that internally and how Heartland wants to handle that internally, too. But we're excited about the development. We think it's a way for us to be able to \u2013 it's a force multiplier for us in the sense of getting Align out there and getting it in front of a lot of customers. And iTero is still critical from a digital workflow standpoint to make it really productive. And at GP offices, you do that.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, no, I appreciate that, Joe. And then maybe I could just sneak one more in for John. On the 3Q EBIT margins, looks a little maybe softer than expected following a relatively strong 2Q on the EBIT margin line. And so just was wondering if you could talk about some of the moving pieces. I think you talked about some of the spending \u2013 areas of spend in your prepared remarks. So maybe just what informs that 3Q EBIT guide?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","I mean I think when we look at \u2013 as was noted earlier, we are investing globally to try to \u2013 as we regionalize some of our manufacturing and treatment clients, so there's some costs associated with that. We saw that in the second quarter. Some of that will continue into the third quarter. But we'll also see from an investment standpoint, from an operating expenditure standpoint, it's balanced. The high end of our guide is 24.9%, which is pretty consistent to what we saw in Q2.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. This is Suzie Yoon on for Elizabeth. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another nice quarter. Looks like total utilization was up nicely in the quarter. Could you just talk about some of the factors that drove the uptick in North America? And then a quick follow-up. Given your findings from the stores so far, how are you thinking about the future store plans?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","As far as the strong uptick, internationally, APAC, EMEA, but also North America. I'd say a lot of what you can see the growth from \u2013 there's good growth from an orthodontic standpoint and a lot of that is a teen marketplace. And I think you've known from previous calls, Suzie, we focused a lot on teens. And that's a really important focus for us because that's a majority of what we see in the orthodontic marketplace is the teen piece.","So just seeing further evidence of our ability to be able to go after that marketplace. We're excited about the teen first launch we put in place. It allows you to do Phase 1 treatment \u2013 dental treatment on teens. And we have a good start, like we talked about, almost 1,000 starts (35:04) for the month. So it just reflects overall momentum that we continue to have that you've seen in other quarters too.","From a store standpoint, we just opened up two stores, one in Maryland and one in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. We'll open up some more stores this year. I think we're doing much better in the sense of preparing doctors of how to integrate those consumers with doctors, and also we're learning a lot in the sense of how to communicate with patients, with visualization tools and things in the store that excite them about the Invisalign treatment. And then we do the proper hands-off to the doctor's office to do that. So it's just another vector for growth for us and a continuation of our consumer interaction from an advertising standpoint and be able to monetize that with the doctor base.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Joe, I just want to talk to you about North America in a little bit more detail. I mean you have posted decent growth in that business, I think, 22% case shipment growth this quarter. But over the last six quarters it's trended pretty steadily in that 20% to 25% range. And I'm kind of curious to get your perspective like what percentage of the docs in this region have already been trained?","And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is what's really the key to sort of breaking out of that 20% to 25% range and accelerating that growth because it feels like we're seeing very strong growth on the ortho side? We're seeing strong growth in terms of teens, but that number seems to be flat lined in that 20% to 25% range. So can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what's going on there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","We feel good about our North American marketplace. When you talk about North America, look at Canada and the United States. And as you mentioned and I'll reemphasize, the teen piece is going extremely well. Are we doing well with GPs also on the lighter cases as we work through that? Yeah, I'd say with the steady state of that, when you start to look at our year-over-year comparisons that's still a very strong performance from a North American standpoint.","So what we're doing to continue to expand that? In the orthodontics segment, of course, we've trained probably the majority of the orthodontists out there. But obviously there's refreshes. There's new products. There's a lot of things we have to continue to reenergize that market with and educate the market as we change that.","On the GP side, obviously we just talked about the DSOs and that kind of an opportunity for us too. And then we feel the stores really help with that consumer initiation and turning those consumers into patients. So overall we have momentum in that marketplace. The third quarter is always a time where you see less of a GP marketplace and a strong orthodontic marketplace. That kind of reverses in the fourth quarter and so you will see in our third quarter piece we have a big number in there for teens on the ortho side to help that growth number.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And maybe just one quick follow-up on the DSOs. What percentage of the North American market would you say is now represented by DSOs? And any other contracts above Heartland and Aspen sort of worth calling out? And what I'm really also trying to understand is, are these GPOs or DSOs rather \u2013 are they just replacing the existing technology they have or are they using iTero to sort of augment maybe what they already have? Thanks and I'll stop there.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I think just to start with your last question. The iTero is new to their office in the sense it's not an augmentation or replacement of equipment they currently have. It's more of a commitment to the DSOs for just the whole idea of digital dentistry. And obviously there's a different workflow that you have inside GPs and you have on orthos. And we've been able to more and more make sure that we have that kind of workflow capability within iTero and we continue to work with that so we can be a great tool for GPs in that sense. The DSOs \u2013 when you say what percentage of the market in North America, we normally quote 15% to 20%. That number kind of varies around depending on what you call a DSO and what you don't. So, the upper number to use on that is 20% and the other one is 15%. I hope I've answered the question.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Yep. That's fine. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, team. How are things?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The first question is on China. So when I think about the drivers for this year that are incremental, clearly the China iTero launch is a big one. I wonder if you could dive in a little bit on how you think about the customer there. Maybe, more specifically, are these people who had access to Intraoral scanners and you're going through a swap process where you give them a better mousetrap? Or are these customers where they were really using PVS or is it somewhere in between?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Steve, it's amazing. I mean it's all PVS. This is not replacing scanners that are over there. So it's not a swap. So if you would see our offices in China at any point in time you just see rooms full of PVS boxes that would previously go to Mexico. So those VPNs that (40:22) we're seeing the number of digital scans come out of China just start to skyrocket for us. John and I were going over that a couple days ago on a trip. So, it's a new foundation. This just is incredible.","I've been doing business in China now for over 20 years and I'm always amazed about the country's ability to target a new technology and just integrate it so quickly into the workflow. Just kind of \u2013 it's the fastest uptake in new technology in any country I've ever seen in the last 20 years. I saw that in the medical equipment business too. You have to train the marketplace. You have to get them ready. You have to be ready to service it well. There's a lot of just foundational infrastructure things you have to put in place there to be successful and not to frustrate them. But once that's in place and you know what to do, the uptake is amazing. And that's what we're seeing right now.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's what I was looking for. And then, just to follow-up. I mean you've given us between China and some of the DSO dynamics reasons to think that the iTero trajectory this year remains really, really strong, certainly beating our numbers. Should we think about the first half as a reasonable barometer for iTero growth for the second half or are there other puts and takes that we ought to factor into the model? Thanks so much.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think, Steve, you're right to call these out. I would call them anomalies in the sense of not \u2013 I mean there's going to be great uptake in China. This is the initial uptake in China. We expect more going forward. On the DSO side, I mean, Heartland and Aspen, two of the biggest DSOs going. So, I wouldn't necessarily draw a line through this one and continue to draw it through the rest of the year. But we are having great success with iTero. You, as much as anybody, know how important that is from a standpoint of having an incredible foundation in place to be able to drive more Invisalign. And so you're seeing these big successes. We have little ones too. But these are big penetration moves and I wouldn't necessarily say that you should take it times 2X as you go into the second half.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really appreciate it. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Joe, if you would kind of discuss the decision to manufacture iTero systems in China. Is that a cost play or a market access play? And would you expect, over some period of time, to actually shift some manufacturing to that location?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","That's actually a really good question, okay. That's a market access play. And having some experience of seeing that before, it's really important in the sense of how it's being done. And the Chinese government \u2013 those provincial governments have worked with us really well to make that work. And it's just so much easier to be able to address those Chinese regulations from a Chinese standpoint than it is, in this case, from an Israeli standpoint too. So that's why we're doing it. From a cost standpoint, this is not a cost play. I'd say expect cost to be neutral. If they are a little worse or a little better, you won't see it in our numbers in any way. So I wouldn't put it in your model.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks and a couple for John. First, any chance you could quantify the gross margin impact on the clear aligner business from the manufacturing capacity expansions? And then any pockets of inflation or material costs or freight or shipping costs that you're seeing in the business?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Nothing from a freight or material cost that is of note. It simply comes down to as we regionalize both from treatment planning as well as manufacturing going live in China from a manufacturing standpoint in Q4. There's start-up costs. You're adding that facility. You're training workers. You're getting that manufacturing up and running. And we saw some of that in Q2. We will see some of that in Q3. And then as we grow and as we get more volume out of those facilities, you see some normalize again. So, it's short-term. It's something that we've expected. And then once we're fully up and running, we get the benefits of being local, faster to our customers. We reduce freight costs. There's a lot of other offsets that we see, but we have to get that facility up and running and that will be in Q4.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Thanks. On your retail store pilot, I understand it's still early days here, but you gave some preliminary metrics at your Investor Day as it relates to the sell-through traction with the retail stores and with, I guess, the majority of the scanned patient scheduling appointments after visiting. I guess I'm curious, do you have an update on any of these metrics and if there's a conversion rate at all that you could speak to into actual Invisalign customers? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks for the question and thanks for the interest. I think, at this point in time, we gave you as much as we wanted to give you at the Investors Meeting. We still call these pilot stores and they are. We're making a lot of iterations as we go through that. But we feel good about the progress. As we get more stores out there and we move this thing more firmly as our stores and not call them pilots, and I'd say as we move into next year we'll be more open with you in the sense of the close rates, number of patients going through. But, as I mentioned on our announcement, we have about 8,000 patients that have gone through those stores already. And then there's varying conversion rates. But, again, not ready to share that yet.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Totally fair. On the DSO relationships, I guess can you speak to how the conversation and the sales cycle had evolved, I guess, at Aspen and potentially with other DSOs and the opportunity there. Is there any sort of new approach that you're taking from a DSO perspective in that sales process?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","We take a broad approach to both of them. These are very good businesses. They're extremely successful what I call businesses too because they operate in a business sense. So we're able to, I think, communicate well in a broad sense what we can bring to the practice and how we can help to drive growth throughout. I mean, obviously, DSOs \u2013 one of the keys are going to be in-store sales. And being able to have an iTero inside that store and be able to drive more aligner sales, Invisalign sales through those is a big help. So, it's just we have organized within the business to be able to work with DSOs much better, bring the resources in place and we put those things in place under Frank Quinn and North American organization over the last 18 months. He's done a terrific job. So, it's not just us. It's the DSOs reaching out for us too. These are good partnerships that are well understood and we're excited about both of them and we feel they'll be successful.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First one on just competition. Joe, is there anything since some of the competitors launched back in May that you're hearing in terms of how they're approaching their customers there and potentially your customer bases with respect to trialing or getting some initial kind of traction in the field or has it been relatively kind of quiet? And then with respect to the guidance question and competition is there anything at all factored into your 2018 growth outlook, including the revised one, any kind of impact from competition? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say from a competitive standpoint what we see in the marketplace is kind of what you expect. I'd say it's a cautious approach from a competition standpoint. I'd call \u2013 if you take a look at 3M, they more like slipstream into the marketplace behind their wires and brackets business and try to get a few uptakes. We'll be on road this week in North America just out talking to many customers, most of the EMC staff. And the feedback that we get is they're being contacted, but there's nothing really that's different from what was the output from the AAO in that piece. And so there's some interest and curiosity I'd say from a customer base, but there's not a momentum piece or anything that we are adjusting the business around right now.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","And I would say, Rich, as we guide and as we forecast we're always looking at what's happening in the market, products that are coming, what's happening with competition. So that's in our way that we look at our guidance and what we expect to see coming. So when we look at our revenue that we talk to for 2018 to low to mid-30s that is inclusive of what we see from a competitive standpoint.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. You're still guiding to Mandibular Advancement FDA approval in the back half of 2018. Anything that occurred intra quarter to kind of give you the confidence to reiterate that timeline? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","It's an old saying no news on the FDA is good news. So we're still looking at the fourth quarter for this year.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just for me, given that you mentioned that you do not plan to renew your current agreement with SmileDirectClub next year, just curious kind of thinking out loud about this. Would you still consider partnering with other players in that direct market? Or is it more likely you'll just kind of abandon any partnerships, maybe just try your best on your own to just capture any volume in that direct market through your various initiatives? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have any interest from a manufacturing standpoint of supporting other, what we call, direct to consumer kind of aligner companies. We're going to run our play in a sense of our stores and how we work with our doctor partners. We feel strongly that a doctor's office approach is a great approach to take, given the seriousness of moving teeth. And that's the vector we're pursuing in this business. And so it'd be kind of disingenuine is after our agreement with SDC runs out that we go find someone else to supply aligners to. We have no interest in that from a strategic standpoint at all.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Congrats on the quarter. Real quick one for Joe and then one for John. For the second half outlook and for the fiscal year, I noticed you bumped up the revenue guide incrementally. Is there anything there in terms of that you're seeing from the new products, whether it's Mandibular Advancement internationally, or from the new iTero launches, or Invisalign First that's giving you a little bit more confidence with how that's started? Or is it more let's call it the legacy business that you're just seeing stability in?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Mike, this is John. I think it's a combination. I think we're seeing, as we've seen in the last couple quarters here, great growth across our legacy business. We're driving great teenage growth. We have a lot of momentum internationally, and we're seeing that. But then as we've seen we've seen great iTero volume as well. So, the DSO business that we've talked about being able to have a release in China, so that in the second quarter we expect that to continue into the second half. So there's a lot of momentum given our existing business, but we have either new products on iTero with the various products that we have, Flex and iTero, too, and then also some of the expansion that we're doing in China and other places.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up on a previous question specifically about iTero in China. You mentioned that right now or previously it was all predominantly PVS. How quickly do you see that market evolving? And in five years can you get similar rates of digital submission as you get in North America or at least elsewhere internationally? Or how long of a timeframe is it going to take to ramp that up?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","As I talked about in the last call, these ramp-up times in China will be faster than they were in the Western world. We know that. The intervening variable in that equation is we're signing up more and more doctors in China, not just orthodontists but GPs. And so those could entitle more PVS impressions, too. So if we look at the current kind of installed base of docs and who submits through that, I feel very confident you'll see this ramped up really dramatically in the next two to three years. But outside of that we might have just other doctors who maybe not buy an iTero but still want to submit for that could come into the equation. And it's just hard to project what that could be.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And then one really quick one, the 5 points of FX tail in the first quarter. Can you quantify? I'm sure it was down small in 2Q. But how much was it?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Actually 2Q was about 4%. So on a year-over-year basis, we saw a little bit less FX benefit on a year-over-year basis than the first quarter but still at 4%.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the same one-third flow through to the bottom line?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","That's right. We saw, actually, about two-thirds flow through to the bottom line.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a couple cleanup questions here. Joe, I didn't hear you say anything about the 19% equity stake with SDC. Is there any change to that once you end the supply agreement at the end of 2019?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I don't know, honestly, Jeff. I'd say we still own that. We'll have to find a way to reconcile that. But that's \u2013 after we get our operational conflict out of the way I think that will be addressed.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough and then on the store concept or the Pilot Store, sorry. How many more are you thinking about opening this year? And, I guess, John, maybe you can walk us through. There's obviously expenses involved in opening those stores. I'd assume maybe that's a little bit of some of the EBIT questions that have been on the call today, as well. But I also hear that you guys are getting full list price on those cases or at least very good pricing on those cases. So, I would assume there's a breakeven here that's pretty quick on these stores. So any comments or kind of color you can provide on that would be helpful. Thanks.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, this is John. Yes, you're right. Stores \u2013 we've got four now. By the end of the year, we'll have 10 stores or so. We continue to find places that are very strategic to us, the right place to turn those consumers into patients through our doctor's offices. There's expenses related to start-up. There's also some targeted marketing that we do in the area. But don't think of it all as incremental. Think of it as we're spending money in certain places on some of the marketing and advertising. And instead of going as maybe as broad, we can go a little bit more targeted to be able to try to get that consumer conversion. So when we look at the second half and what we've guided for the year, we've now said that we expect to be up in operating margins from 2014. So there's no flat anymore. So, with these investments that we're making, we still think that they're ultimately incremental to our business and a key part of our strategy.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. See you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, I don't think you've mentioned the financing pilot. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on that? And if you're considering taking it more broad, what the timing might be?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I'll turn you over to my expert on the financing.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, John. This is John. So, on financing, it's really moved from a pilot to \u2013 it's fully released now. And what it is is a tool that we have with our sales team as well as working with our doctors to be able to give patients options in terms of financing, so they can do some things where they can look to come up with financing over a period of time. It's beneficial to the doctor. It's beneficial for the patients. Ultimately, we get paid faster. So there's a lot of wins. But really what we're trying to do is make it easier for those end customers, those end patients to be able to come up with financing to be able to get them into treatment and we think it's a benefit to everybody in this value chain to be able to get a higher conversion. So it's gone from pilot to full release. And we're actively working with doctors and potential patients to get the understanding of this.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just one more follow-up, another DSO question. I think there's maybe 50 of size in the U.S., at least that's my understanding. How many of those would you say you've got relationships with at this point?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I'd say we probably have contact with over 75% of them. I wouldn't say we have a relationship to the degree we have with Aspen and Heartland in that sense, John. So obviously DSOs are on our list in a sense to work with (58:32) and we put together an organization to do that. But right now we're really focused on the agreements we've put in place and we want to make sure that we really work and execute well on these.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, VP of Corporate and Investor Communications.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? .","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","I'm pleased to report third quarter results with revenue and earnings above our outlook, driven by higher-than-expected Invisalign volume, offset somewhat by lower ASPs and foreign exchange. We also had another record quarter for iTero scanner business. Q3 Invisalign volume increased 5.5% sequentially and up 35.3% year-over-year, reflecting strength across regions and customer channels as well as strong growth from both teen and adult patients.","From a product perspective, we saw strength across the Invisalign portfolio, with growth from both the comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, reflecting acceleration in the non-comprehensive category related to expansion of our product portfolio, as well as new sales programs and promotions intended to increase adoption and utilization. We also saw continued strength from international regions, especially Asia-Pacific, which is our second largest region after the Americas in Q3.","Finally, during Q3, we trained another record 4,930 doctors, driven by APAC and Latin America, including Invisalign Go doctors, which represent continued expansion of our customer base, especially GP dentists. And Invisalign utilization increased overall to 6.1 cases per doctor, including another record for NA orthodontists.","Overall, while I'm pleased with the strong volume growth that we achieved this quarter, there were a couple of unexpected factors that impacted our results. In Q3, Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially due to a combination of promotional programs, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases across all regions. John will provide more details on this in his commentary.","Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results and let's start with the results of our America region. For the Americas, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.1% sequentially and 29.1% year-over-year, reflecting better-than-expected volume in both our orthodontist and GP dentist channels, driven by strong teenage case volume from orthodontists and adult patient growth across both customer channels.","For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by orthos, with another record quarter for North American ortho utilization at 17.4 cases per doctor. Q3 Invisalign utilization for North American GP dentists was up year-over-year at 3.5 cases per doctor, reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base. We also saw strong volume growth from the dental service organizations or DSOs channel, which increased over 40% year-over-year in Q3.","In Q3, we trained over 2,000 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 560 were in Latin America alone, primarily Brazil. As the world's second largest market for cosmetic procedures, Brazil is estimated to have more than 1 million new orthodontic case starts each year. In September, we hosted a grand opening event at our new office in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil with local doctors to thank them for their ongoing support in helping to build the clear aligner market in Brazil through Invisalign practices.","We also hosted the grand opening of our newest facilities in Costa Rica located at San Antonio business center, with plans to open another multimillion-dollar facility located at La Lima later this year. The new facilities will eventually house all of our Costa Rica employees, provide space to accommodate our long-term growth.","For international doctors, Q3 was another good quarter with Invisalign case volumes up 6.2% sequentially, reflecting a very strong quarter for APAC, offset by EMEA's seasonality, especially in Southern Europe markets which typically have extended summer holidays. Year-over-year volume growth of 45.6% for international reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base.","In APAC, Q3 was a strong quarter with Invisalign volumes up 56.4% year-over-year, with record shipments for all country markets except Korea. Q3 results reflect record utilization for APAC driven by strong growth from teenage patients as well as growth in the GP dentists channel up 83.2% compared to last year.","During Q3, we trained 1,730 new doctors in APAC, of which 310 were iGo doctors. We also held several clinical education events across APAC designed to help increase doctor's confidence in and the adoption of Invisalign treatment, including how critical the iTero scanner is to practice growth.","In China, we hosted the China Orthodontic Society, or COS, annual meeting with over 1,000 doctors. In Japan, we held an Invisalign Forum with clinical speakers focused on teen treatment, including Invisalign First cases, adding iTero to their practice and Invisalign G6 innovation. In ANZ, we launched Invisalign First clinical education events and practice marketing activity and received positive feedback with great uptake of Invisalign First cases.","In EMEA, Q3 was down sequentially due to expected seasonality up to 36.2% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth including the teen segment, which was up over 60% from the prior year. Year-over-year we saw strength across our core markets led by France, Iberia and the UK, as well as our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe. We're also continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,100 newly trained doctors in EMEA, which include 485 iGo trained GP dentists.","In Q3, we hosted a number of doctor-centered peer-to-peer events, including our first GP Growth Forum in Copenhagen. We also hosted the grand opening of our new treatment planning facility in Madrid, Spain, which serves the Iberia market. Our Madrid facility aims to increase our commitment to Invisalign trained doctors in Spain and Portugal, and will play a key role in our strategy to be closer to our customers and support them in digital treatment planning.","In October, we hosted our first MEA or Middle East and Africa Forum in Dubai, highlighting the growth of the MEA orthodontic market, as well as showcasing our latest advances in digital dentistry that provides practice growth opportunities for dentists.","Now, turning to the teen segment. In Q3, 98,500 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 25.6% sequentially and 41.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, led by North American orthodontists. Q3 was the eighth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teen patient volumes grew faster than adults, reflecting a continued shift toward younger teens and tweens. The Q3 year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American orthos increased 32.8% and international doctors were up 60.9%.","In Q3, we launched an expanded Invisalign portfolio including Invisalign First for Phase 1 treatment of young patients age six and up. On July 1, we began offering Invisalign First to doctors in North America, EMEA, and ANZ and Japan. We shipped almost 2,000 cases to over 600 doctors during Q3. Half of the cases were in North America, and nearly 60% of the Invisalign First patients were 8 or 9 years old. The Phase 1 segment of the market is really important for us because it's a large piece of the overall orthodontic cases. But it will also help us gain share in the teenage segment.","The Invisalign Experience program is a comprehensive way of describing all of Align's activities to engage consumers or potential patients through brand experiences in consumer-friendly settings and environments, including busy mall and lifestyle centers. We started out calling these locations stores. We've realized this is confusing and concerning to some of our doctor customers. We're not selling Invisalign treatment to consumers in these locations. Doctors have always been essential to Invisalign treatment, and a doctor's prescription based on an in-person examination remains the only way that Invisalign treatment can be delivered to a patient, even if a consumer learns about the Invisalign brand in new or different ways.","In late 2017, we launched the Invisalign store pilot program to create and test interactive Invisalign brand experiences in high traffic retail locations. Our goal was to educate and engage consumers who might be interested in treatment but aren't showing up as typical consults in offices, and get them connected with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.","Based on what we have learned in last year and across the first four locations in this program, we are expanding this program and will open eight additional Invisalign Experience locations in the fourth quarter. The first four Invisalign Experience locations have shown great progress since opening and have contributed to a significant influx of consumer interest in the orthodontic marketplace surrounding each location.","Key performance metrics suggest that the addition of an Invisalign Experience location can have a significant positive impact or halo effect on overall Invisalign patient growth in the surrounding area, even among doctors that are not directly participating in the Invisalign Experience program network. It's a new way of creating awareness for brand, capturing someone else's attention when they're not even thinking about straightening their teeth, and it benefits all Invisalign practices in the market.","In Q4, under the Invisalign Experience umbrella, we're launching a major test of the program in New York City with a significant investment in media to reinforce the importance of doctor-led Invisalign treatment and a premium consumer experience to drive qualified consumers to partner doctor practices. On November 5, we will launch a targeted media campaign in New York to take advantage of growing interest in the clear aligner category to capture and direct consumers to Invisalign-branded locations and pilot practices. This test includes an Invisalign-branded kiosk at the Oculus Center on November 17 as part of the Holiday Market.","Number two, piloting Invisalign Experience-branded doctor practices designed to attract prospective patients, connect them with the Invisalign brand and an Invisalign practice for treatment. And three, empower doctors with new tools, services and support to elevate the patient experience, amplify the message and grow their practice. We're very excited about this program along with several other media campaigns kicking off in Q4 to put doctors at the center of everything we do.","We've learned a lot from the Invisalign Experience locations and the doctors who have worked with us in the network to-date. We're applying what we have learned and are constantly working to make the Invisalign Experience program better for consumers and better for the practices who opt-in to receive those leads.","One of the things we've learned from this and other initiatives is that a lot of Invisalign doctors want to do more in their own markets to connect with new consumers. They want to create an Invisalign Experience in practice to connect with potential patients in new ways and want to leverage the total Invisalign iTero digital experience to make starting treatment easier and more convenient for them.","We want to help them to do just that, so under the Invisalign Experience program umbrella, we're working with a few doctors in select U.S. markets to explore what an Invisalign Experience looks like in wholly doctor-owned, consumer-focused environment. We're calling this pilot an Invisalign Experience branded practice and are working with participating doctors to apply some of the lessons and design elements from Invisalign Experience locations to their practices.","Some of these pilots will be in markets where we have Invisalign Experience locations, but most will not. Doctor-owned Invisalign Experience practices don't complete with Align. We're all working together to reach consumers in new ways. We'll share more progress with you and details on the different ways we're partnering with doctors under the Invisalign Experience umbrella in the coming quarter.","Our Smile Concierge program that we launched at the beginning of 2017 is continuing to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment by shortening their research cycle and connecting them with an active Invisalign doctor. Year-to-date, we scheduled over 74,000 Invisalign consultations in the U.S., which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign doctors every day, providing leads they might not otherwise have had.","The Smile Concierge service has also expanded outside the United States with teams in Singapore, Brazil, Australia and the UK. And Q3 was a very strong quarter across the board for our iTero scanner and services business, with better than expected revenues which were up 37.2% sequentially and 79.1% year-over-year. Record Q3 results reflect commercialization of the iTero Element 2 and Element Flex scanners, especially for restorative GP dentists in North America. Continued rollout with DSO partners and increased sales internationally including China, we have also begun to manufacture the iTero Element.","Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. The Q3 total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas was essentially flat at 68.8%. International scans increased 51.6% of total Invisalign cases submitted in Q3. We are very excited about the continued progress we have made with the iTero business and remain confident it will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase adoption of Invisalign treatment.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to share this important news with you today regarding our Chief Marketing Officer or CMO, Raph Pascaud. After more than eight years with Align, Raph has made a personal decision to reduce his responsibilities and transition to a part-time position in order to spend more time with his family. As a result, we have begun an executive search for a Chief Marketing Officer, and will be working to find a replacement for Raph's marketing position over the coming months.","Once we've hired a new CMO, Raph will transition his marketing responsibilities to that leader, but he will continue to lead the business development and strategy for the company. Raph will also remain on the Executive Management Committee, reporting directly to me.","Raph's contributions to Align have been significant. He's held numerous leadership positions across the organization, including Head of International, Marketing, Product Portfolio and Business Development, as well as overseeing the iTero business. We're fortunate that Raph will remain directly engaged in our strategy and overall business plans and will be able to help the new CMO come up to speed quickly.","Until then, nothing changes and Raph remains Align's CMO and SVP, Product Portfolio and Business Development. We're sharing this news with you today so we can openly recruit for a new CMO and so Raph can begin to develop a transition plan with his global marketing team.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $505.3 million, up 3.1% from the prior quarter and up 31.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. Clear aligner revenue of $421.1 million was down 1.4% sequentially, driven by lower ASPs as a result of higher-than-expected discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by increased volume.","Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 25% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, and was partially offset by lower ASPs. As Joe mentioned earlier in his remarks, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially and year-over-year due to a combination of promotional programs, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by price increases across all regions.","In Q3, we offered a new product promotions designed to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment and we saw much higher-than-expected uptake on some of these promotions. In addition, at the beginning of the year, we created a more robust North America Advantage customer loyalty program, which has been very favorably received by our doctors.","The new Advantage Program changed to a semi-annual discount qualification period instead of a quarterly one, with additional tiers that provide doctors with more incentive to move up the tiers by increasing their Invisalign case volume. As a result, more doctors are moving up in tiers and achieving higher overall discounts than they were under the prior program.","In Q3, we also saw a shift toward lower ASP non-comprehensive products, some of which is tied to promotions and some is tied to continued progress expanding our business with GP dentists and DSOs. Specifically, Q3 ASPs were down by approximately $85 and includes $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange, and down $80 year-over-year and includes $15 of unfavorable foreign exchange. Total Q3 Invisalign shipments of 319,300 cases were up 5.5% sequentially and up 35.3% year-over-year, driven by growth in the Americas and APAC, partially offset by seasonality in EMEA.","For Americas orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 8.6% sequentially and up 32.2% year-over-year. For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 0.3% sequentially and up 24.2% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.2% sequentially and up 45.6% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the third quarter was $78.2 million, up 37.2% sequentially due to volume increases in North America DSO contracts and higher volume in APAC. Year-over-year revenue was up 79.1%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions.","Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 73.6%,down 1 point sequentially and down 2.3 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 75.3%, down 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to lower ASP described earlier. Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.6 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASP and regional expansion of our manufacturing activities. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 63.9%, up 4.4 points sequentially and up 3.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing efficiencies.","Q3 operating expenses were $246.6 million, up sequentially 1.5% and up 27.3% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our R&D and go-to-market activities. Our third quarter operating income was $125.2 million, up 2.1% sequentially and up 26.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating income is primarily due to higher revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating income primarily reflects leverage from operating expenses on higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services.","Our third quarter operating margin was 24.8%, down 0.2 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin from lower ASPs as mentioned above, offset by increased operating expense leverage. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin from ASPs and continued expansion of our regional manufacturing facilities, offset by higher operating expense leverage.","With regards to the third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 19.4%, which includes a $24.7 million release of unrecognized tax benefits due to a statute lapse, partially offset by a $20.2 million charge related to non-deductible officers' compensation based on recent IRS guidance. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.24, down $0.06 sequentially and up $0.23 compared to the prior year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the third quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $613.2 million. This compared to $720.7 million at the end of Q2, a decrease of approximately $107.5 million, primarily due to our stock repurchases during the quarter. Of our $613.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $228 million was held in the U.S. and $385.2 million was held by our international entities.","Q3 accounts receivable balance was $420.3 million, up approximately 12.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, or DSOs, was 75 days, up 7 days sequentially and flat as of Q3 last year.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $96.3 million, down $21.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of pending tax refunds. Free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $42.6 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $53.7 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. During Q3 of 2018, we repurchased $150 million of our stock against our stock buyback authorizations, and have $550 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program.","With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. We expect Q4 international volume to increase sequentially from Q3, reflecting the EMEA market seasonality stronger period following summer holidays in Q3, offset somewhat by seasonally slower Q4 period in APAC as China comes off a very strong summer period.","For Americas, better than expected Q3 volume was driven in part due to some promotions that have been discontinued. We expect Q4 Americas volume to increase slightly sequentially. We expect our iTero business to be flat sequentially in Q4, coming off a very strong Q3, as we continue to invest in growing the iTero business across all regions including China and ongoing rollout with DSO partners in the U.S.","We continue to expect SmileDirectClub volume to be at minimal contractual levels and are anticipating a decrease sequentially from Q3. With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 330,000 to 335,000 cases, up approximately 29.4% to 31.4% year-over-year. We expect Q4 revenues to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million, an increase of approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for Invisalign volumes, offset by lower ASPs due primarily to ongoing promotional discounts, the effect of our new Advantage customer loyalty program, continued mix shift toward non-comprehensive products as well as foreign exchange.","We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 72.3% to 73%, reflecting lower margins as we begin to produce clear aligners in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China, where we will initially have higher fixed costs spread across very low volumes. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $248 million to $253 million. Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 23.2% to 23.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 22.5%.","We expect approximately $2 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.3 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.15. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $55 million. And we expect depreciation and amortization to be $15 million to $16 million.","Now let me turn to our view for the full-year 2018. Based on our Q4 guidance, we continue to expect 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low-30s. We expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to also be in the low-30s. Taken together, we continue to expect operating margin for the full-year 2018 to be slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John. Overall, Q3 was another good quarter with strong growth for both the Invisalign and iTero businesses. Our performance reflects continued success in driving adoption and utilization across all region and customer channels, as well as an increased traction in new expansion markets with our DSO partners.","We have a huge market opportunity ahead to connect millions of consumers with Invisalign doctors for orthodontic treatment, and whether it's through traditional routes in a doctor's office or through new consumer-friendly approaches like the Invisalign Experience program, we are committed to a doctor in the center of everything we do. Align is the best positioned company to help doctors successfully navigate the rapidly-changing dental market. We're excited to be guiding them through this digital transformation.","I look forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various conferences and industry meetings, including the Invisalign Ortho Summit in Las Vegas next month where approximately 2,500 doctors and their staff will spend two days sharing Invisalign and iTero best practices, one of our most important peer-to-peer clinical education events.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Joe and John, for the question. I guess just to start on the lower ASPs, which you guys provided some details around at least the areas that impacted it. And John, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like of the $85 sequential decline, if I remove FX, it would have been more like $60, $61 sequential decline. So, of that decline, I was hoping maybe you could just break down how much of that came from promotions versus mix shift.","And then I guess the follow-up would be, I don't necessarily remember you guys talking so much about the additional promotional program. So, curious if there was something in the marketplace that kind of forced you to react to put the promotions in place, or if this was something that was always planned and maybe the uptake was just greater than you thought?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Bob. This is John. On the remaining piece that's left, about half of the drop in ASPs was due to mix. It was mix shift to the lower stage products. And about the other half or $30 or so was related to those promotions.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","And Bob, it's Joe. Look, obviously on the Advantage Program and the special programs we ran for the quarter, we do this all the time. We're trying to encourage customer stickiness. We're checking out different segments of the marketplace. We do this all the time. But in this case, what happened is we incentivized the upper end of our customer segment. We did not get the engagement in the lower end that we anticipated. And so, in that sense, we will shut that thing down. We won't repeat it again. We obviously learned from it and we move on.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then I guess, Joe, just to follow-up on that then, as we think about ASPs for 4Q and then more importantly beyond 4Q, is it safe to assume that FX will be what it is but that at least the portion of the headwind from the promotion should normalize?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct. Think about it as flat, Bob.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe, John, in terms of the aligner gross margins in the quarter, can you break out the impact of the manufacturing capacity expansions relative to ASPs? And as you look into 2019, given we're kind of bouncing along the low end of your three- to five-year model here at about 73%, would it be logical to expect year-over-year expansion in terms of the aligner margins as you start to soak up some of that new manufacturing capacity expansions?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. You're right, Brandon. I mean, what we'll see initially because of the low volumes, we'll see more of that fixed cost over that low volume. So, that's a 0.5 to 1 point impact due to the manufacturing start-up. And then as we get more efficient, we should see some improvement as we go forward related to those manufacturing costs.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And then one for Joe. The OpEx guidance for the fourth quarter implies the slowest year-over-year growth rate in a few years now. To what extent are you beginning to see perhaps some diminishing returns from incremental investments, be it feet on the Street or marketing or otherwise, perhaps in some of the more international and emerging markets?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Brandon, I think if you look at our growth, I mean our growth is above 30% right now. So we don't see any diminishing returns in that sense. Remember, we had a big third quarter when you look at our volume growth versus other years. So the normal sequential kind of iteration that we go through between third and fourth quarters, we don't really believe it's going to be as dramatic as it has been in the past.","And so this doesn't reflect anything from a market standpoint. Remember, as you look at our performance overall, international market's performed extremely well, okay? We still had incredible shipments in North America from an Invisalign standpoint. We also had great iTero, too. So, primarily what we're looking at is what we have with these promotions in the sense of the ASPs driven by them and the corrections we have to make as we go into the fourth quarter.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Brandon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe. First one, John, I think you mentioned flat scanner revs Q-over-Q and I've got to make some other assumptions. But I'm backing into around a $1,200 Invisalign ASP for 4Q 2018 based on your volume guidance. 3Q 2018 I believe was $1,230 on a worldwide basis. You mentioned some of the promotions that were run in 3Q will not be repeated. So why the continued decline on the worldwide ASP into 4Q? And then do we think about extrapolating that $1,200 if I'm right out to 2019? And then I've got a follow-up.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, Jon, I would look at Q4 as continued mix effects that we have. So, as we are \u2013 the low stage that we've seen through Q3, some of the mix shift that's happening, that will continue into Q4. But like we had said, those promotions that we had, those specific promotions that were driving down some of the ASPs in Q3 will not continue into Q4. .","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, Joe, you may have answered this to Robert's question earlier, so I apologize if this is redundant. But I think it's important obviously with the focus on the promotion. So, can you be a little bit more clear that the promotions that you ran in the quarter, you hear the word promotions at the same time that two or three comprehensive clear aligners were introduced in the market for the first time ever and that's going to freak a lot of people out, right? So the promotions that you mentioned, were those specific to express-type cases? Were they more specific to comprehensive? Any clarity you can give would be great. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Jon, to answer your question backwards is, these are comprehensive cases. From a competitive standpoint, look, we continue to monitor the competition in the marketplace. Ormco is still out in ANZ and not completely engaged. 3M has obviously hit the marketplace in the United States and we see it. But these promotions were not geared toward trying to stop any competition that we're feeling right now. That wasn't the whole part of this promotional piece.","Remember, third quarter's a big teen season. We had to make sure that we run the proper promotions going in there. This is a teen promotion and also an adult promotion too. Again, we're just trying some things in the sense of incentivizing the marketplace and it just happened to engage the upper tier of our Advantage Program rather than a lower tier that we had hoped. And these go on all the time kind of under the radar screen, Jon, and we don't talk about them. This one in the sense of how it performed obviously affecting ASP, we just have to give you clarity on it. But, again, I want to re-emphasize, this is not based on anything competitively that we saw in the marketplace that we thought we had to move around.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI","Hi. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Speaking of what you were just talking about on sort of engagement in the lower end of the market, how are you sort of thinking about what you're going to shift going forward? That would be my first question. And then could you sort of also talk about the typical GP path in that lower-end customer? Do they start with lower-priced products and then sort of move up, or do they sort of stay in that lower-level product mix shift? Any further color on that would be really helpful. Thanks.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks. Actually can you repeat the first question? You're kind of light on the volume. We couldn't hear the first part of your question.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI","Oh, sorry about that. Is that better?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI","The first part of my question was, obviously, you said that you didn't get the engagement you were hoping for on the lower end of the market. And so I was just wondering sort of what you've learned from that and sort of how you're thinking about that engagement with that segment of the market going forward.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. On the lower end of the marketplace, it's just exactly how we target those incentives and how broad do we make them, okay? This was broad across all of our Advantage tiers. In the future, we'll just have to focus on the lower tiers in that sense in order to encourage that piece. I mean, it's that simple kind of feedback. We thought it'd be more of a balanced response across the tiers and it wasn't.","And now on the GP, I think your second question had to do with GP doctors and how they get engaged. With iGo, as we start iGo, it's a mid-range product that we position with GPs that allow them to be able to do certain kinds of movements that we think are relatively simple to learn and for doctors to really start off the product line. And so, as you see the iGo growth all around the world, that's predominantly what we'd call a mid-range product that we're positioning with GPs at the moment.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Does that help?","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI","Yeah. That was helpful.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. You're welcome.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","And Elizabeth, I'm just going to add one other thing just in terms of what we're talking about with respect to ASP. The other part of the conversation has to do around the new Advantage Program this year and how that has additional tiers, and intended obviously to incentivize doctors to move up in tiers, and what we saw was the higher volume doctors moving up in tiers more than the lower tiers. So, that's part of the impact as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from...","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Question...","Operator","Sorry?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Go ahead, Jeremy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, and thanks for the time here. I wonder if I could come back, Joe, to a point that you made earlier, maybe an intersection of a couple points. I mean, you talked about how doctors are thinking about an evolving environment. I wonder is there something in the environment that is changing the way that clinicians respond to promotions or product line efforts or to the Advantage Program? Is there something different about it this time? I ask the question because historically the company has a lot of experience running these types of programs.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, I don't think the market is conditioned any differently than it's been before. The biggest change we've seen in the market is really just SDC in the United States marketplace. But that is a completely different segment since it's not through doctor's offices, and obviously that's not where the competition is right now.","I think if you look at this, Steve, I think with this new Advantage Program we launched in North America in 2018, it just has a different series of brackets, a different series of rewards, at different kind of bonus levels. We haven't really engaged promotions around those things before. So it was a little bit of a learning curve in the sense of how those brackets, as Shirley talked about yesterday actually respond to these kinds of promotions.","Don't look at this \u2013 I think I can understand your questions and the previous questions about, is there some external aspect that's really driving those things. If there was an external some kind of catalyst in this sense, we'd tell you. I'd tell you, okay? That's not why we do these things. We do these things to encourage customer stickiness. We do these things to figure out what really works in the marketplace.","Look, I've never been in a business that has price elasticity curves like this business. And you really have to study those. We launch promotions, we do them at certain prices. We see what the uptakes are and we learn from those things. We're just launching this against a different type of an Advantage structured program and these tiers are different and this take-up was completely different than what we've seen before.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just to follow-up on your point about SDC, I think I know the answer to this, but your view is still that any overlap between SDC cases and Align cases is low-single-digit percentage-wise, is that still correct?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think we've always said it's about \u2013 back when we were actually comparing data with these guys, back before our lawsuit, and it was about a 10% overlap is what we saw overall. We don't have any information that would change that at all at this point, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks very much. Joe, any update on the timing for mandibular advancement in the U.S. or the palate expansion product that you talked about at Investor Day?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, John. We're expecting in the fourth quarter is what we said all along. Our communications with the FDA have been nothing bad or anything that would suggest that we're not on course. So I'd just say we're still sticking to our plan of being able to launch this product in the fourth quarter United States.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then how about the palate expander product?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Palate expander, we're still working through that. When you think about it, our Invisalign First product is a palate expansion product but it's not a rapid palate expansion product. So we're digging into that six- to eight-year, nine year marketplace with Invisalign First. We're still working through \u2013 in fact, I went through it this morning with a team. We're still working through the rapid palate expander and we'll give you an update on that as there's more to talk about. We're still thinking it's trialing in 2019 like we indicated at the most recent investors' conference.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just, John, any kind of key puts or takes you want to call out as we start thinking more about the outlook for 2019? I assume FX will be a bigger factor in the coming year?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. We're not giving the 2019 guidance, as you know, John. But FX is a piece of it. We call it out. It is what it is. And then everything else is on our operational performance. But we'll give a good update on 2019 at the next call.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. You're welcome, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, if I look at your slides that you provided, slide 30 specifically, you can see a step-down Q3 to Q4 on the pricing side both worldwide and internationally. Were you running some kind of program similar to this back then? And then we saw recovery over the next several quarters. Is that something kind of like what we should expect this time around?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, what we see, Matt, that comes through some of those slides and trends is FX effect. So, if there's foreign exchange that comes through there, it shows up as well. So, some of that, especially when you look on the international side, you can see some of the FX effects there.","Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sure. Just to punch a little bit further on that question specifically though, the moderation that you should get from the promotion going away, maybe some more mix benefits going forward. This should be kind of the low watermark maybe here in Q3 for the ASPs with the gradual increase over the next several quarters. Is that fair?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I think what we're expecting is kind of the Q4 ASPs that we're kind of calling should be that low point and that's how you should think about things going forward.","Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then as the follow-up question and actually to talk about something positive in the quarter, even though there was a lot positive. On the scanner side specifically, can you parse out a little bit where that performance came from? Because that should be a pretty good leading indicator for the business going forward. DSOs, international, et cetera, would you mind just providing a little more color there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Matt, it's Joe. When you look at it, every region we had a lot of strength in iTero. You start with we have now major penetration into China and great uptake there. Last year, we were approved in Japan and that's been good too. So, really all up and down Asia it's been strong. In North America, it's been strong across our individual doctor base but also, as you mentioned, the DSOs have been very strong also.","And then also in the quarter, we did see increasing momentum with iTero scanners over in Europe too, which is our most difficult competitive market. We have good momentum there too. The launch of the Flex product line and iTero 2 were really great launches. Customers loved the product too so the response has been terrific. So, everything has been working extremely well with that business. But remember, that's just a wonderful footprint for us for future Invisalign business once we have those scanners in place.","Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","All right, Matt. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just clarify. I think you had said you're still expecting mandibular expansion \u2013 I'm sorry, the mandibular product in the fourth quarter, best of your ability to predict the FDA. Is it right that that's not factored into your Invisalign case volume guidance or your 4Q guidance?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. We don't factor it in, but honestly within one quarter of the launch of that, we wouldn't expect anything material, Richard, to report in that sense. And that's not anything to do with mandibular advancement. It's just the way things work around here in the sense of doctors will try this, they'll do a few cases, they'll get used to it. And then, as we move into 2019, we'll give you some idea of what we think mandibular advancement United States uptake would be.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe one other one. I noticed that the percentage of cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas was flat and it's been increasing almost every quarter for quite some time. I'm just wondering if that's somehow linked to some of the kind of anomalies that we saw around trends with ASPs or if there's any other explanation there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","No, Richard, there's no correlation with the ASP side. Remember, last year, we ceased allowing 3Shape to be able to submit scans. And so those doctors would have to go back to PVS impressions, and we think that's pretty much what drove that. Obviously, our scanner sales have been really strong in United States. So we think that's just basically a re-submittal because of the situation we have with 3Shape right now.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. And then maybe just one last one. You said that you didn't get an expected kind of reaction in the marketplace from kind of the promotions across kind of both parts of the market, complex and simple. I guess what's your hypothesis as to why it didn't work on the low end of the market? Or do you have kind of a running assumption as to what maybe you got wrong or why it didn't work?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Richard, first of all, it's not low end, it's low tier. So we have an Advantage Program. An Advantage Program has several tiers. It starts at Bronze, it goes all the way up to Double Diamond, okay? And so, when we talk about that, these are still broadly their comprehensive cases, okay?","When you put these promotions in place, you want to make sure you're sensitive in the sense of who you're incentivizing across these brackets, right? What we're saying is we didn't have strong enough incentives on what we'd say the lower end of our Advantage tier program. And, obviously, that'd be the change we'd make going forward.","Makes sense, Richard?","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I thought we lost you.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. I won't ask about ASPs, but the Invisalign Experience locations, could you provide any sort of new metrics around in terms of conversion rate or traction or any sort of key performance kind of metrics there. And how will the economics work for the doctor-led Invisalign Experience locations with the rebranding and all? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Erin we haven't given any statistics yet on our Experience centers. And we only had four stores, and now we're expanding the other eight stores right now. As we move into 2019, we'll be more transparent with that information.","The doctors can engage in several ways. The doctors are actually engaged with the store. These products have a certain premium assigned to them, because we actually attract the patients and send the scans to the doctors or whatever. So, depending on what it is, Signature, Signature Plus or Deluxe, there's obviously a lab fee for the aligners but there's also a certain fee for those types of products.","And then we're talking about the halo effect too. The halo effect, sometimes it's the doctors who aren't even associated with the program at all, we're still seeing a significant increase in Invisalign sales to those doctors just because of just the raising the awareness of Invisalign and doctors in that specific geographical area. And those are areas of anywhere between 10, 25, up to 50 miles we start to see that kind of response.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And then you've previously alluded to financing initiatives for customers that seems to make sense here, but I don't really hear you speak much about it. I guess where does that stand today on that effort? And that remains purely a third-party relationship today? Thanks.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Hi, Erin. Yeah. This is John. Yeah, the financing, it continues. It's primarily in the U.S. and it's something where it's financing that's not on our balance sheet's third-party company that we work with. And really we're just trying to find easier ways for our end consumers to be able to use Invisalign and make things easier for them. So we continue to do it. It's part of the conversion that we try to use. And it's been rolled out across the U.S. for a few quarters now.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. So I guess for the 35% case growth in the quarter, which obviously accelerated pretty nicely. I'm just curious if there's any color on how much of that volume growth was maybe tied to what we'll call the overly enhanced promotional activity. Or are you more of the mindset that maybe you would have had essentially the same case volume growth overall if there were no alterations to the loyalty program? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, we can't nail it exactly, but we can tell you it's 1% to 2% on the North America volume.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. One other quick one \u2013 again, if you're slightly off on where you want to be on your ASPs because of this activity, just kind of thinking out loud without giving anything away for next year, just curious if you also think you could potentially increase list prices maybe a bit more than normal to get you where you want to be on ASPs for 2019, just as another lever that you could pull if you wanted to when thinking about optimizing price.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, you don't want to comment on price going into a year. We never do that, Steve. But we have raised price every year in the last three years. Obviously we raised price in this quarter, too. And it's been part of our strategy. It fuels a lot of the things we would do. We talk about Invisalign Experience and our marketing campaign and driving customers' adopters, also all the technology we invest into. So it's been a pretty large part of our strategic plan. But I don't want to comment on 2019 in that sense.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good evening, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe. So let me start just on the Invisalign Experience. It sounds like you're moving that into some private practitioners or some other offices here in the fourth quarter. Any discussions on moving that into the DSO channel where you could almost supercharge that or really get into 600, 800 offices at a time?","And in those cases, I think you alluded to it, Joe, a little bit in your comments just a second ago. But my sense, at least from the conversations I've had is that the gross margins are actually accretive in cases that come through that kind of channel because you're kind of doing some of the work to get the patient into that office. Is that a fair way to look at that?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, it's a really fair way to look at it. I mean, we talked about Aspen last quarter. I mean, the whole idea of the Aspen piece and their uptake of iTero scanners was to put what we used to call a store in store. We now call it an Invisalign Experience thing in the doctors' offices within Aspen. And part of what we've done in the stores is we've created obviously consumer material. We've created a lot of things. From a customer engagement standpoint, turning customers into patients, we put those in place and we'll be able to employ in those DSO stores too. So, that's been a big part of our strategy and it's one of the reasons you see such a big uptake in the DSOs that we've been selling to and reporting.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough. And then, again, there hasn't been enough ASP questions here tonight but I just want to understand, John, your comments. You get some of the promotional activities right-sized in the fourth quarter. Currency probably is a little bit bigger of an impact going forward. So, fourth quarter you would expect ASP to be down sequentially a bit versus 3Q, is that right? And then we kind of see a recovery throughout 2019 or at least a little bit trending up in 2019, as some of those currency headwinds in the back half come off and maybe some of the promotional activity headwinds do as well?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Jeff, what we would see is \u2013 you're right, on the FX, you see it come down a little bit from an ASP standpoint in the fourth quarter. But then from the fourth quarter, we expect it to be about flat, just given the mix and other things that we've talked about in terms of what we see in the business.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just to clarify that, so whatever our fourth quarter ASP, wherever that ends up, that you would expect holding flat, then moving throughout 2019 sequentially?","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes. That's how we would look at it.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra form Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple based on the margin outlook for the business. So, just working through that flat pricing outlook, how do we think about the gross margin implication on the aligner business. I mean, you have these plants coming online. Is it similar type of kind of ramp that we look at a step-down from 3Q in the aligner gross model and that kind of remains flat or slightly increases going forward into 2019?","And then, just a question on the marketing strategy, as kind of Raph steps aside, you have a number of new programs going on here. You have a new marketing leader coming in. You have an orthodontic summit in a month. How do you kind of like look at your dental segment and your customer base, the orthodontists here? Are we in a world where you're trying to get greater productivity from your top dentists and let the less productive guys I guess to call it less of a focus on that? Or is there room for everyone here? How are you looking to approach that? Thank you.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Ravi, I'll take the gross margin question. Yeah, as we said, coming online with some of the manufacturing, it's at certain amount of costs that we need some of the volume now to be able to spread those costs over. So we guided in Q4 to reflect that. And then, as we get more efficient related to that manufacturing, both the manufacturing and the treatment planning that we have kind of globally, we'll start to see some of the efficiencies related to that manufacturing and treatment planning that will affect our gross margins.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","And Ravi, it's Joe. Your question on the segment and top dentists versus \u2013 or top orthos versus lower brackets, I'd just end it by saying there's room for everyone. You have to segment this market always between general dentistry as we call GPs and also orthodontists. But when we talked about at Investors Day, we see a market that we used to measure as 12 million case starts a year as potentially 300 million. But what we specifically talk about with our doctors, particularly on the ortho side, is this is a massive what we call analog to digital conversion, right?","If you really want to get the productivity of a digital-based orthodontic system that ends up in plastic, and that's what our process is, is you really have to do predominantly a majority of your business has to be in digital. And those doctors that walk forward that want to go through that journey with us, we have a number of programs to take them through from financing to how you encourage more consumers, how you set up your practice, all those things, so you can make it as efficient as possible.","On the general dentistry side, we often work from a restorative standpoint to make sure that we can work within those restorative workflows and make sure that it's profitable for those docs and they understand how to use these things.","Ravi, one thing I want to make certain, and maybe it's just me being overly sensitive. Don't take Raph's announcement in any way as any indication that he had some responsibility for this promotional aspect for what went on. Raph's been tremendous for us. After running our international business, coming in and running marketing and strategic development and also business development, he's been critical to this business. This is not some kind of smoke and mirrors. This is Raph making the decision from a family standpoint that he's had issues with that he has to deal with right now. We support Raph in that from a family standpoint. This has nothing to do with him.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. A lot of questions have been taken but I just want to follow-up on a couple points. One is, are you getting any sense that the pretty substantial price difference in the quarter, the discounts, are they being passed onto customers by the dentists? I know it's tough to measure those channels sometimes and it's aggregated, but are you getting any sense that the dentists themselves are being squeezed on pricing by the end customer and they have to do something to adjust?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","We don't have any data, Michael, to hold up with that. I'd say, remember there's a million points of light in this business too because there's so many doctors overall involved. But I don't feel this has to do with having these promotions actually in some way and have that passed onto consumers. It's just not the feedback we get or what we think is going on.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And then a follow-up just real quick on the DSOs. I think you mentioned 40% growth in the quarter as a customer grouping. And the mix is shifting, still a small part of the overall business, but is there anything that's different there in terms of how much price you're able to get with those customers versus some of the stand-alone docs?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","From a DSO standpoint, obviously these are large contracts we put in place. And there's significant price discounts in the sense for the volumes that the DSOs offer. So, when we talk about mix, there's a certain amount of mix associated with DSOs. When you see these kind of growth rates, 40%, it's obviously some aspect of the mix that we're talking about.","So, when you think about that too, Michael, is that we don't have to spend as much OpEx on the DSOs. And it's really important to understand. A lot of them since they're general dentists, they use their own patients to generate their demand. The normal GP dentists would have 1,500 to 2,000 patients per office. We could help them mine those patients to understand which ones would want orthodontic treatment or could stand for orthodontic treatment or not. We don't have to have the amount of sales coverage that we'd have with individual doctors.","So you're going to have a lower overall ASP on those businesses, but we feel that from an OpEx standpoint we're not spending as much money too. So, from a gross margin standpoint, it's still positive for us.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.","Good evening, and thanks for letting me just hop in here at the end. Just two quick ones for me. Maybe, Joe, to start with, you mentioned in one of the prior questions price elasticity curves for the market. Could you maybe just give us your views, as the market continues to evolve, what level of margin you think that your higher echelon volume providers expect to maintain and maybe how that differs versus the lower tier provider as these markets evolve, just in terms of profitability by caseload?","And then, just from a clarification standpoint, John, if I'm doing the math right, just kind of doing the puts and takes on the one-timers there on the tax rate in the quarter, am I right in that it's about $0.05 to the positive when we look at the net effect there for the 3Q? Thanks.","John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, just on the tax, we just gave kind of the highlights of the overall that affected tax. We had guided 21% and ended up at 19.5%. So you can pretty much say that it's 1.5% of our tax was a few things that came in a little bit favorable compared to what we guide. But those two were just kind of the big puts and takes for the quarter.","Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","As far as the price elasticity curves by docs going forward or whatever, I don't have any comments on that or really any projections of what that's going to be. When we talk about those things, we talk about segments. It would be lower segments or comprehensive segments or teen segments and those kinds of things. But we don't necessarily have that data by doctor or doctor tiers and where it's going to. And if we did have them, not so sure we'd share that anyhow. We just like to keep it at high level.","But I'll just tell you that we're aware of these price elasticity curves from a specific \u2013 not just demographic, but a specific area of the marketplace all over the world.

Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments: Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners. David will provide more detail on our financials and also discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.","Q1 was a solid start to 2016 with better-than-expected revenue and earnings, driven by continued strong year-over-year Invisalign volume across our entire customer base, with North America up 21% and international up 34%. Demand for our new iTero Element scanner remained strong, driving a 72% year-over-year growth in Scanner & Services revenues.","For Q1, North America Clear Aligner volume was up both sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q1 was driven primarily by our North American orthodontist customers, who achieved record utilization of 10.4 cases per doctor this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our Q1 volume growth rate continues to outpace the three-year average, and was driven by continued increase in ortho utilization and expansion of our GP customer base.","Q1 Invisalign volume for international doctors was down 1.5% sequentially, as expected, given the seasonally lower period in Europe through the winter holidays and up to 34% year-over-year.","In EMEA, Q1 volume was up 34% year-over-year, led by growth across our core European countries. It was especially strong in Spain, which was up 70%. The investments made in sales, clinical and customer care with our new selling processes are showing quick returns.","Our new geographies also performed well year-over-year with Benelux, Eastern Europe and the Nordic markets up over 90%.","In Asia-Pacific, total Q1 volume was 35% year-over-year, led by China and Japan, each of which were up 50% or more. Record Invisalign volume in both Southeast Asia and Taiwan was driven by growth of more than 40% year-over-year, as we continued to make progress in smaller country markets with our direct sales approach.","Next month in Macao, we look forward to hosting our second Invisalign APAC Summit, where almost 700 customers will attend the largest Invisalign Summit outside of North America. The APAC Summit will focus heavily on recent innovations, Invisalign advantages over other treatment options and peer-to-peer sharing of successful treatment outcomes in very complex cases.","In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q1 increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenagers 11 years and 19 years old. On a 12-month basis, 148,000 teens started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign with an average age of 15 years. We're pleased with continued growth in teenage cases, especially among North American orthos. We're also beginning to make progress in growing our teen business outside the United States, where we had 30% year-over-year growth from international doctors.","Our integrated customer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA, and APAC leverage traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchasing journey.","Consumers' interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow, as we can see from the increase in key program metrics worldwide. For example, in Q1, the total number of unique web visitors to invisalign.com or its regional equivalent, increased 30% to 3 million. And the total number of consumers who search for an Invisalign provider increased 27% to nearly 0.5 million.","In North America, 2016 marked the strongest Q1 to-date for the Invisalign brand, in terms of earned media with 27% increase in overall impressions.","In EMEA, we focused primarily on lead-generation activities in Q1, which drove 670,000 visitors to rejoin Invisalign website and our Invisalign social media community grew significantly, up 150% compared to Q1 last year.","In Asia-Pacific, we've been preparing for several major consumer campaigns in China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan that we'll launch in Q1. The new campaign in China will be our very first in the country, targeting females 25 years and older in both Shanghai and Beijing.","In Q1, our Scanners business revenue was up 17% sequentially and 72% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in a quarter. Demand for the iTero Element scanner continues to expand our installed base, fueled primarily by North American orthodontists. As of Q1, 94% of our top 1% of elite orthos have purchased at least one scanner and 64% of our top 1% of elite GPs have purchased a scanner for their practice.","We also continue to see strong adoption of digital scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions.","For Q1, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanning worldwide increased to 36%, which reflects a record 44% from North America and 18% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our iTero scanner, we're beginning to see some uptake from 3M's True Definition, and Sirona's Omnicam, the other two digital scanners that also qualified for Invisalign case submission.","Adding to this today, we announced Invisalign interoperability with another third-party scanner. In Q4 of this year, 3Shape scanners are expected to be approved which will enable Invisalign providers with a TRIOS scanner to submit a full arch digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression.","Clinical validation of the workflow is mostly complete, however given our ERP implementation this summer, the ability to support TRIOS scanners for Invisalign case submissions could not be finalized in our Invisalign Doctor Site, which we call IDS until after the ERP implementation is complete.","We also announced an agreement with 3Shape to enhance existing STL export workflow between iTero scanners and laboratory partners using 3Shape dental system software. This will enable improved consistency for customers using the workflow.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our first quarter financial results. Revenue for the first quarter was $238.7 million, up 3.7% from the prior quarter, and up 20.5% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. On a year-over-year comparative basis, first quarter revenue growth rate was lower by approximately five points, related to the Additional Aligner policy and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","First quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $219.7 million was up 2.6% sequentially and up 17.5% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes. Q1 ASPs were slightly up from Q4, about $5, due to more Additional Aligner submissions and dealer promotions, partially offset by foreign exchange rates and a small shift in product mix towards our low-end products, driven by the single arch option we introduced last year.","Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to Additional Aligner policy change and foreign exchange rates.","For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 163.7 thousand cases were up 2.1% sequentially, reflecting growth predominantly from our North American orthodontist customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 25.2%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontist, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 23.6% year-over-year.","For North American GP dentists, case volume was flat sequentially and up 18.6% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 1.5% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was 4.9 cases per doctor, up from 4.5 cases in Q1 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 10.4 cases, up from nine cases in the prior year. North America GP utilization was a three cases, up from 2.9 cases in the prior year. And international utilization was 4.7 cases also a record, up from 4.4 cases per doctor in Q1 last year.","In Q1, we added 2,470 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 870 of which were new North American doctors, and 1,600 of which were new international doctors.","Our Scanner & Services revenue for the first quarter was $19 million, up 17.2% sequentially and 72% year-over-year. We're pleased with continued strong demand for the iTero Element scanner. Notwithstanding these strong results, production capacity has been more constrained than expected as we strive to ramp production and work down backlog.","Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.7%, slightly better-than-expected, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 0.6 points year-over-year.","Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 78.3%, up 0.4 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by lower freight costs from a slightly lower mix of international shipments.","The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower Clear Aligner ASPs related to our new Additional Aligner policy implemented in July last year.","Q1 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 45%, up 7.3 points sequentially and 16.7 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower cost of our iTero Element scanner.","Q1 operating expenses were $127.3 million, up sequentially by $13.8 million or 12.2%, primarily due to the planned annual increases in employee compensation and benefits programs, costs associated with our internal sales meeting event that take place in Q1, increased investments in sales and marketing, and go-to-market activities, as well as our ERP implementation program.","Q1 operating expenses were lower than our outlook due primarily to more ERP costs being capitalized and anticipated during the quarter. In addition, the timing of certain investments in marketing were delayed to the second quarter and second half of the year.","On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating expenses were up $25.1 million, or 24.6%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of our business, as well as our ERP implementation project.","Also recall, that in the first quarter last year, operating expenses included a benefit of $6.8 million, associated with a medical device excise tax refund.","Our first quarter operating margin was 22.3%, down 3.5 points sequentially and down 2.4 points year-over-year. This sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to higher expenses as just described.","On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating margin was impacted by approximately 2.5 points from Additional Aligner policy and foreign currency exchange. Also note, again that the year-over-year comparison reflects the aforementioned benefit on the medical device excise tax in Q1 2015.","With regards to our first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 23.4%, slightly up from our 2015 tax rate of 22.6% and 18.2% in Q4 2015. 2015 and Q4 2015 tax rates are lower primarily a result of lower tax expense related to the true up incidental to the filing of certain tax returns and the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in Q4 2015.","First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.50 compared to $0.60 reported in Q4 and $0.44 reported in the same quarter a year-ago. First quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.09 per share from the new Additional Aligners policy and a year-over-year impact of currency. Further, recall that the first quarter of last year included a benefit of $0.06 per share associated with the refund of the medical device excise tax.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $20.2 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, as well as our ERP implementation.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $30.7 million and free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $10.5 million.","During the quarter, we also used $22.6 million of cash to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued. Over the last 12 months, these amounts, together with repurchases, has amounted to $128.6 million.","Today we announced that our board of directors has authorized a plan to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of the company's stock. This latest authorization is in addition to the existing $300 million authorization announced in April 2014, which brings the total authorization to $600 million.","Today, we have repurchased approximately $200 million of our stock and anticipate we'll repurchase another $100 million over the next 12 months.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short-term and long-term investments were $680.8 million. This compares to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $2.1 million. Of our $680.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $216 million was held by the U.S. and $464.8 million was held by our international entities.","With that, let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook; for North America, we expect Invisalign volumes to be up sequentially from Q1. For international, we typically see strong sequential growth following Q1 winter holidays in EMEA and the Lunar New Year in APAC.","For our Scanner business, we expect revenues to be up sequentially from Q1, as we continue to ramp production for the new iTero Element and fulfill strong backlog and demand. Notwithstanding this strength, given recent and continuing constraints on production of the new iTero Element, our outlook for Scanner revenue for the full-year is slightly less robust than originally anticipated.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 174.5 thousand cases to 177.0 thousand cases, up approximately 20.7% to 22.4% over the same period a year-ago.","We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $253.3 million to $258.3 million. We expect Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%, slightly down sequentially, primarily due to a higher freight cost due to increased mix of international shipments, as well as increased training revenue, which carries lower gross margins.","We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $142.7 million to $144.2 million. Q2 operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter based on several factors. Q2 will carry the full quarter impact of employee compensation-related costs, such as annual wage increases, stock-based compensation awards, and new hires.","Some investments in sales territory coverage and go-to market activities that were anticipated in Q1, were delayed to Q2 in the second half of the year. Given our continued success in driving growth and adoption of Invisalign outside the U.S., we do intend to make some incremental investments in the second half of 2016.","Our Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 18.7% to 19.7%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.49.","With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David. I'm pleased with Q1 and our better-than-expected start to the year thanks to continued growth and adoption across our customer base. We credit that to our focus on and investment in key growth drivers, especially our continued expansion outside of North America, commitment to product and technology innovation and consumer demand programs that help drive Invisalign adoption.","Q2 will be a busy quarter for us with the upcoming AAO in Orlando, the APAC Summit in Macao, and our Analyst Day coming up in June.","I look forward to seeing many of you at that Analyst Meeting in New York to sharing more details about our opportunities for growth, our competitive advantages and the key things we're focusing on for the future. Thank you for your time today.","I'll now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. You guys mentioned that some of the investments were delayed from Q1 to later in the year. I guess, first part will be why, were they delayed? And then the second part and more importantly, does that delay in investment have any impact at all on your view of mid-20% revenue growth for the year. Obviously, case growth continues to be pretty strong and also tied to that level of investment. Just wondering, if the timing of the spend, has affected at all your view of the full-year?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","So, Bob. This is David. I'll see if I can field that for you. They were marketing expenses as we talked about, as I mentioned in the script. They were, however, though related to things that had a longer-term aspect to them. So, they weren't near-term types of items that would necessarily be driving current year case growth. They had more to do with portfolio types of planning and studies and things like that. So, no impact to the year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then I guess just on the international side, case growth, you are obviously very robust there. But kind of in line with the type of growth we've seen in the last few quarters. I know you guys had mentioned more investments this year coming on the international side versus the domestic side.","I'm just curious, if you could talk about what type of growth rate or growth rate acceleration we should maybe think about on the international side, and then maybe just the timeline or timing around the returns on the investments you're making internationally would be helpful?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's Joe, Bob. And I'd say, you know the \u2013 what we expect is to continue with the growth rates, we've seen you know in the \u2013 from an international standpoint, but I don't see a change there.","In a sense of \u2013 you know overall in that business, it's pretty much what we've been telling you, there's not a lot of dilution in the sense of what we do internationally, in the sense of the resources that we put it in a year; and the return, we're getting on those resources through so, think about that return in the aspect of a one-year kind of return on international commercial kinds of resources.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys. My first one is actually on the buyback. Well, of course, very nice to see. My question is, are you framing the buyback for 2016, as something like a new normal or is this something that we should think of as a one-time step-up relative to the historical trend?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","So, I don't think there is any intended change in the program that we announced a couple years ago, Steve. We announced $300 million, we anticipated to repurchase $100 million a year.","In the first two years of that program, we repurchased $70 million of the $100 million in each case, using an ASR and then we repurchased the remaining $30 million in open-market transactions over the balance of the year. And this year, pretty much the same thing except for changing it to a 50-50 split. No other change other than that.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. So, it's not \u2013 okay, now I understand the period you're saying. And then, my second question actually David is, could you quantify how much of the spend was delayed out of Q1 into the balance of the year?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","So, the portion that was delayed into Q2 is in our guidance. Portion that was delayed into the second half is about $2 million or so, roughly.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, I will...","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","Go ahead.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Have a good night.","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, John.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Hi, Joe, can you just maybe give us some update on market commentary. There has been a fair amount of economic volatility in recent months. Are you seeing any of that filter through to your GP or ortho customers?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I haven't seen any change at all from what we experienced in 2015, as we go into 2016 and nothing recently either in that sense.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, what does that tell you? Does that say there is just not as much sensitivity around what we would probably think of is a fairly discretionary purchase by consumers or do you think there's just such an under penetration for Clear Aligners that you can kind of power through a cyclicality that an orthodontist might see?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll be cautious, I haven't gone through a cycle in this business yet, John. So, I'll just be cautious on what I'd say here. See, if I look at the economic data and backup a little bit, a lot of that economic data has to do with inventory and production right now. And I don't think it's in a consumer sense, something that's definitive yet.","So, what I'm seeing right now, I want to try and communicate to you is, the market fields now is the market has for the last really 10 months since I've been here. If this thing hits the consumer and there is a significant consumer effect, I think, it'd be na\u00efve of us to say that we think we'll just power through that with the same kind of growth rates we have today, but I think we just got to take that a quarter, but a quarter of time right now.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then one more. You mentioned the upcoming AAO meeting. It's been a little longer than I think in the past of when you guys have announced some product updates, any preview you could give us about something that might be coming there or just in general the cadence that we should expect about new product innovation?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No big change in the cadence of new product introduction. I can't give you any kind of a look under the covers right now, in the sense of \u2013 you know what we might do at the AAO, John or not do at the AAO.","But, look R&D is incredibly important to us, you know we're focused on now inclusions in the sense of making this a deeper and deeper penetration against wires and brackets. We're really excited about that future portfolio and what we can do, but not ready to announce anything big coming up on the AAO right now.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, just a question on the digital case submissions. I'm curious as to your latest thoughts on how much contribution, or how would you characterize the success or progress of the Seric (28:32) relationship so far? And just given the installed base size, I'm surprised it didn't seem to have been a larger contributor to-date, any color you can share there?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Brandon that really hasn't changed. I think we try to communicate to the market as much as possible, as that we think that these open-source way is the way to go to make sure that you know \u2013 ability to no matter what's game you're on, if you have the kind of accuracy and capability that you can submit in this line kind of order.","I'm frankly not surprised of what we see, I think when you look at Sirona, they've been cautious in the sense of how they bring people on and make sure of the accuracy and \u2013 which is really good in the sense of how they can interface with us. And so, right now, it's really no change in the sense of, I think what we anticipated prior to Sirona coming on and what we're seeing right now.","But again, we feel good about that open-source commitment, and we feel good from a North America standpoint, in particular, to see the rates of digitized impressions coming in. It's good for our business, it's actually good for customers, because of the sensation, because of the accuracy of it, and how much faster we can actually turn things around.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","And \u2013 sorry, if this has already been asked, I don't think so, but could you \u2013 you'd pointed to perhaps the Cadent or iTero scanner revenues falling a little bit short of your prior goal for the year. Could you quantify that and perhaps give us a sense of the magnitude of the backlog and how long you think it might take to burn off?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Brandon. So, when we ended 2015, we had more than six months of backlog on the iTero scanner and that number still holds true today. Notwithstanding the fact that, our revenues in that business were up significantly in Q1 and we're almost doubling the business.","In the January call, we talked about our expectations that business perhaps doubling this year and I think that might have \u2013 given where we are today with some production capacity constraints and so forth, that might have been a little bit more optimistic by maybe 10% or so. And we hope to work through those constraints and work down the backlog as we continue to ship product throughout the balance of the year.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, you guys have seen impressive North American growth over the last four quarters, how much can you attribute that to the stratification of the sales force?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, it's not a binary instrument on this whole thing, I think the stratification was helpful, when you define that stratification is, we're focused on our really high-end orthos, what we call our SAM (31:38) accounts and then how we've \u2013 allow our territory managers to go across orthodontics and also GP. It's been an efficient alignment, but we've also put a significant number of more resources into the field also, and so there is a multiplier there in a sense that the customers were touching and how we're spreading the workforce.","So, I think those two main variables, it's hard to pull part how much each was effective, but we know that both of them have been effective in the sense of allowing us more customer time and placing reps in front of high user kind of accounts that really need different types of things than some of the newer users or smaller users, too.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. And also, I apologize if you guys have maybe answered this already, but single arch was a big growth last quarter. How much of that contributed to GP segment this quarter? Thanks.","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","So, good question. As we looked at it, if you look at the single arch and you look at even the pricing actions we took a year-ago in Q2, where we lowered the pricing on both the E5 and the E10; we changed the staff discount program, and so forth.","As we look at it now, we're seeing great traction on those products; I mean they're growing well and \u2013 much faster than what the rest of our business is on a volume basis, maybe not the same way on a revenue side. But, certainly on a volume basis, they're growing at a rate faster than what our full products are. And when you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis, or I should say a year-over-year basis, it's probably about three points of growth when you compare it year-over-year.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from ROTH Capital Partners.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Hey, Chris.","Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Joe, you mentioned \u2013 hey guys.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Are you there?","Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","I'm here, can you hear me?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, got you.","Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Joe you mentioned, you're beginning to see some progress with teen in international markets; can you talk about what's starting to drive that progress?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, again it's not subjectivity to my comment here, but I think, if you look at the history, particularly in North America, we had a history here of years of people thinking we really \u2013 orthodontics is not thinking we can do with teen.","As we go overseas, I don't think we're burdened with that mythology as much as \u2013 because obviously we changed the type of malocclusions we could do; we moved into teens pretty well. We've changed our portfolio to address that, and just think there is less inertia to overcome overseas than maybe what we've had in North America over the years is my guess. And obviously what we're going to have to do is double back in North America and push a lot harder in the sense of our capability in that area now to overcome, I think, some history that's existed there.","Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","On Additional Aligners program, it's been around I think nine months since you implemented that, I was hoping you could just take a minute and kind of talk about it here, if you're starting to see ordering patterns and your customer behavior in terms of your utilization rates being impacted from that program?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Yeah, Chris, when we look at the impact of Additional Aligners, we look at it over many years. We see increasing usages of Additional Aligners over time. And primarily, that's the result of a number of factors: the fact that we're treating more complex cases, the fact that our mix is shifting a little bit from the standpoint that International is growing faster than what North America is, since they treat typically more complex cases than what we do here in North America; that's kind of shifting some of that.","But when we look at all those usage rates, we don't see any particular aberration in those rates that we can specifically attribute to the change in the policy. What we know is that, when we talk to doctors they love it. They are appreciative of the fact that it's easier for them to practice with us; they don't have to be constantly thinking in the back of their mind, if I submit in a \u2013 and a request for Additional Aligners, am I going to pay for this one or not.","So, when we look at the data, we don't actually see anything that shows an aberration, since all pretty much qualitative, and we know that it's one of the factors that we believe is driving the record ortho utilization we're seeing right now. Utilization last quarter \u2013 Q1 was 10.4 cases and it's one piece of the whole puzzle, I think.","Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, guys. Maybe two or three. The first one Joe, I believe for you, on the teen market, I think you guys gave some metrics, teens up about 22% trailing 12 months, but it is like in adult, and you mentioned the average teen age around 15 years old, but of course, a lot of teens are out there getting orthodontic care at 11 years old to 14 years old. So, I guess the question is, can you go younger with the current product, or do you need something more specific to mix dentition and tracking compliance et cetera?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jon, I think you know the answer of that question, you know that. But I think honestly, one part of the practical side of me, Jon, is that our teen utilization rate in the 20% to 25% range depending on how you look at it, is really insufficient, given the market is 75% teens. And so, regardless of how young, you want to move back into the teen segment, we have plenty of opportunity when you look at complete dentition above 13 years old.","So, we should be able to get out regardless of that kind of an approach. But I mean, obviously our R&D is focused on how we can go back and look at what I call morphology changes rather than just moving piece is actually moving things in. Obviously, we have some clinical trials in the marketplace in that area to see how well our appliances can fit in that particular area and we're optimistic about it.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And next two questions I promise I really don't know. So with the first one David for you, you mentioned maybe on Cadent more optimistic by 10%. I just want to make sure, I understand what you meant. So, the Cadent revs were going to roughly double this year, which was the initial guidance, that was an incremental $45 million. I believe what you're saying, maybe it's $4 million or $5 million too high, that's \u2013 is that correct? And then second part is, do you make up that $4 million or $5 million shortfall just to keep your \u2013 I think it was low to mid-20% revenue guidance for the year? And then, I've just got one more.","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","So, I think, the net of it all is that our revenue guidance is roughly intact. We'll make it up elsewhere either through pricing or through other things that were built into that plan.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just a very last one, you guys gave some interesting metrics on sort of the percent of high volume guys that own a scanner and there is a lot of them and we've been showing the average scanner user. There is a lot more cases in your overall average, but this brings back in the question sort of the chicken or egg, so are there any metrics that you can give even at a higher level of what someone looks like before they get a scanner and then where they go six months, 12 months or 18 months after they bring it into their practice? Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jon. We're obviously looking at that. Our penetration rates are being furthered right now. You got to look at ortho, definitely we do GPs in that sense, but we really don't have anything definitive to share with you yet, that would say, you buy a scanner, you automatically do more Invisalign. We're not ready to say that.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for your time, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Robby (39:55) in for Rich. Can you hear me?","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Hi, Robby (39:58), yeah.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Robby (40:00).","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question \u2013 a couple of questions. One, maybe on the doc training and then another on gross margins. First, on the Invisalign doctors training, sequentially, it looks like there is a seasonal step down in North America, but you're flat year-over-year, whereas O-U.S. training stepped up sequentially. Hoping you could help explain some of the dynamics behind that, and how we should see training progress throughout the year.","And then, maybe second on the gross margins. Scanner gross margin of about 45%. Where do you think that can go over time? And should we think of sort of 2Q, 4Q at the similar level? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Robby (40:47), on the doctors trained, when you look at those statistics, you'll notice that typically we train more doctors internationally than what we do in North America. And when you break it down and you look in North America, it's primarily GPs. I mean, there are reengagement of orthos and so forth, but the predominant mix is on the GP side.","And in terms of the seasonality of that, we typically have a couple periods during the year, where that is higher, Q2 and Q4 are typically the periods during the year that we offer more training, and we try to get more enrollment during those time periods.","On the international side, I think it fluctuate less on a quarter-to-quarter basis and it probably geared more by our capacity that take on doctors and feel like we've got enough clinical health and so forth, to get them watched and start off their Invisalign practice. And I don't think we see as much seasonality in terms of how we plan out the international doctor side of it. And then the second question was on scanning.","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","The gross margins on Scanner.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the gross margins on Scanners, they are in the 45% to 50% type of range and a lot of that is due to, when we designed the new iTero Element. We designed it, as not only a more feature-rich product than the 2.9, which it replaced; but we designed it a lot for cost reduction and so, you have a much smaller footprint in terms of physical form factor, that sits in the doctor's office, you have much lower support costs for the product, because the wand detaches from the base unit. The training is all done virtually, instead of us actually \u2013 having to actually whole classes on the training, it's done virtually.","The doctor installs it himself versus us having to send somebody into do a field install. So, all those things kind of contribute from a business model standpoint, why it's a better gross margin proposition than what the prior version was. Does that answer your question?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. It does. And then maybe if I could get one more in, regarding the 3Shape announcement, sorry if you had mentioned it, I may have missed it. Did you say anything about what you think their installed base is and how many that opens up?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","No, we didn't. And we're not quite privy to that information either. So, I mean obviously, it's a successful scanner, but there is not an installed base number that's been shared with us.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Thanks, Robby (43:46).","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Robby (43:47).","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good evening, guys.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Joe, just wanted to start with you. Hey, how are you? So, Joe, starting with you on the utilization number, the 10.4 case number obviously as you guys said kind of an all-time high on the North American ortho side.","As I'm looking at it, it's also I think without the biggest sequential jump up I've seen in that metric as well. So, I don't revisit the point you made about kind of end market being stable. How much of that sequential improvement maybe is coming from some of the efforts, you guys have been putting in the field, a lot of the work we've done and I'm sure others, but survey work in that seems like North American dental market has picked up here a bit in the last six months. How much might be tied to those factors, things like that? Just want to focus a little more on that 10.4 case number, if possible?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, it's a good question. I'd tell you again, it's a great answer, because I think we don't see this definitively. But I would say, I just look at kind of a constant force from a market standpoint over the last 12 months.","And then overall, I think it's really the people we put into field and it's obviously I think some of our inventions like D5, D6. And then frankly, when you think about E5, E10 and some of our pricing dynamics on that too, all these things I think have really helped from a penetration standpoint with those guys.","So, I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to a market uptick. I think, the market is in very consistent. I think, our resource allocation and focuses, I think, it really help in that sense.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. And then David, just one question for you on the guidance or at least on some of the P&L numbers. You mentioned the operating margin 250 basis points here, I think, you said between the extra Aligner policy in the FX in the quarter. Any chance you could split that out or disaggregate those two numbers?","And then, just want to make sure I've got my gating correct. It seems like the FX drag pretty much goes away starting in the second quarter in the extra Aligner policy, will at least anniversaries through the model starting in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about those drags?","David L. White - Chief Financial Officer","When you always do these compares, it's always against what you're comparing to. When you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, FX and Additional Aligner is not a big impact on Q2; it was a little bit of a drag, but 20 bps or so. When you look at it year-over-year, you see a bigger impact and like we said about almost three point, most of that Additional Aligner, about $8 million of that is Additional Aligner and like another $2.5 million or so roughly of FX.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, the FX component as we go into 2Q would expect that pretty much on a year-over-year basis, were done with most of those headwinds at this point you think?","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you tell me what exactly...","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No. Assuming currency stays stable where it is today.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. If currency stays flat, the only \"headwind\" you might say we have that we keep calling out is Additional Aligner. An Additional Aligner \u2013 our discussion about Additional Aligner and its impact, kind of swan songs in Q2, because once we get to Q3, our comparatives will have the full impact in both ways.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Thanks, Jeff.","Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments: Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner & Services. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Q3 was another good quarter with revenue and EPS above the high end of our guidance. Our results were driven by strong Invisalign case volume, up 2% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with growth across all customer channels and geographies. North America volumes grew 18.6% year-over-year, and our international geographies were up 35% compared to last year.","This growth was driven by continued momentum in EMEA, in APAC, progress in North America, expansion in our low-stage product segment, and seasonally strong uptick in teenage patients. In North America, Invisalign volume was up both sequentially and year-over-year with the highest year-over-year growth rate for North America in three years. Sequential growth was better than expected, driven by seasonally strong teenage demand in ortho channel, where we had another record quarter for utilization at 9.9 cases per doctor. This is the third consecutive record quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, growth was driven by both orthos and GPs, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign by existing ortho customers and expansion of our GP dentist base. Our investments in sales force effectiveness are producing good results. We're pleased with the progress we see in North America. Customers are responding positively to our new sales structure, and we expect to continue to make incremental investments in go-to-market, clinical education and customer support in this important market.","Invisalign volume for international doctors was up sequentially and year-over-year. Our international volume continues to be very strong across all countries in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, which increased 31.5% and 41% respectively. The continued strong growth for international was driven by continued adoption of Invisalign in EMEA and expansion of our customer base in APAC. On a sequential basis, Invisalign volume was better than expected and strong growth in APAC help offset the seasonally slower period in EMEA. In EMEA, our year-over-year growth continued across all major regions with strong performance by Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. Increased coverage and sales execution continues to build strong momentum. We have a good balance of growth from newly-trained and existing customers.","In September, we hosted our eighth EMEA summit, our largest to date with almost 500 doctors, including 75 from APAC, coming together for an intense clinical education and peer-to-peer networking conference for Invisalign providers. The program focused on building clinical confidence and expanding early adoption of recent innovations like Invisalign G5 and Invisalign G6 and ClinCheck Pro. We were pleased to hear consistent and constant feedback throughout the summit that doctors are more confident using Invisalign for more complex cases.","In Asia-Pacific, Q3 was another record quarter in almost every major country, with China and Japan leading the growth. China now represents our sixth largest country market globally. Q3 utilization was consistent with the prior year and growth reflects continued expansion of our customer base in the region. During the quarter, we continued commercialization activities for the Invisalign G6 across the region with numerous clinical education events in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and Thailand. And in cooperation with Sunny Dental, we helped open the first Invisalign-dedicated clinic in Beijing.","In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases in Q3 increased 22.3% year-over-year. This reflects continued adoption across our customer channels. On a 12-month basis, over 134,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign this past year. Product innovation remains core to our long-term growth and ability to accelerate adoption of Invisalign treatment in both the adult and teenage segments. The extensive new features and functionalities we have introduced over the past five years, including Invisalign G5 and Invisalign G6 as well as SmartTrack Material, have raised the bar for simple and comprehensive clear aligner treatments. While Invisalign clear aligners are already recognized as very credible orthodontic appliances, we will increasingly focus our efforts on creating doctor advocacy for Invisalign clinical competencies.","In Q3, our Scanner & Services business revenues were up sequentially from higher sales of iTero scanners. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down as expected and in line with our guidance as a result of the transition to the new iTero Element scanner. Since its introduction in March, interest and demand for the new iTero Element has been overwhelmingly positive. During the quarter, we completed the initial market release of the iTero Element orthodontic scanner with shipments starting in September. To date, over 2,000 Invisalign cases have been initiated with the new iTero Element.","Customers tell us that the new design meets the high level of precision they expect from an iTero, with an Invisalign scan acceptance rate of 99.8%. We will expand the market release of our iTero Element to include restorative applications during Q4 this year. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North America was 40.5%, up from 39% last quarter and 34% the same quarter last year.","In North America, our integrated consumer marketing approach continues to be highly impactful, with Q3 consumer search interest for Invisalign treatment up 20% year-over-year. In addition, we had more than 1.3 million unique visitors to our invisalign.com website, and more than 112,000 potential patients search for an Invisalign practice on our doc locator.","Our multichannel marketing approach leverages national television, search, digital marketing, PR and social media and is designed to engage consumers throughout every point in the consumer purchase journey.","During Q3, we focused on reaching moms and teens during the key back-to-school season by continuing the Invisalign teen confidence campaign we launched in May. The campaign generated more than 385 million consumer impressions across 20 key markets and drove moms to the invisalign.com parent page, with unique visits up 102% during the campaign period.","In EMEA, our integrated consumer plan relies heavily on social media and online marketing in key markets. Even with the summer holidays across Europe and related seasonality, we saw great engagement with find-a-doctor searches increasing by 250% year-over-year and 200% growth in our EU social media community.","Before I turn the call over to David for a review of our financial performance, I want to comment on two recent litigation filings. This week we dismissed a California state lawsuit originally filed against ClearCorrect in 2011. That suit alleged unlawful business practices regarding pricing and has no bearing on our outstanding patent infringement case against ClearCorrect through the International Trade Commission, ITC, who previously found ClearCorrect to infringe on our patents. ClearCorrect also dismissed a related cross-claim against us in California.","In the area of litigation, today we announced that we have filed an infringement and false advertising lawsuit against SmileCareClub, Sharper Image, and Brookstone, companies involved in the sale of do-it-yourself at-home clear aligner products sold directly to consumers. The details related to our claims and specific patents in question are noted in the press release we issued. However, it's worth mentioning here that while this is a new lawsuit, we believe ClearCorrect is treatment planning and manufacturing aligners for SmileCareClub using the same methods that the ITC previously found to infringe on Align's valid patents. We anticipate that additional information regarding this relationship will come to light during discovery.","SmileCareClub not only markets and sells its aligners directly to consumers, it also supplies aligners to resellers, Sharper Image and Brookstone stores, who are named in the lawsuit as retailers of the SmileCareClub system.","This situation is of particular concern in that it not only involves the marketing and sale of a product we believe infringes Align's patents, SmileCareClub also promotes a treatment option that seeks to eliminate the critical role played by the doctor in the patient's treatment. Align has always believed that orthodontists and dentists play a critical role in successful orthodontic treatment using clear aligners, which is why the Invisalign system is so tightly integrated with the treating dental profession.","With over 640 patents worldwide, litigation is part of doing business as an innovative growth company and we will continue to assert and defend our intellectual property rights. The ITC has already found that ClearCorrect's product infringes Align's valid patents, and we are confident that the final outcome in both cases will be a win for Align.","I'll now turn the call over to David.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenue for the third quarter was $207.6 million, down 0.9% from the prior quarter and up 9.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter revenues included a non-cash reduction of approximately $7 million related to our new Additional Aligners policy announced last quarter.","Third quarter aligner revenue of $198.3 million was down 1.3% sequentially and up 11.3% year-over-year. The sequential revenue decrease was primarily related to our new Additional Aligners policy as just mentioned. Q3 ASPs were down sequentially about $45, which was almost entirely due to higher revenue deferrals from the new Additional Aligners policy. Excluding Additional Aligners, ASPs were otherwise flat quarter-over-quarter.","Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to foreign exchange rates and the higher revenue deferrals just mentioned.","For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 147,500 cases were up 2.0% sequentially, reflecting growth from our North American orthodontic and international customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 23.3%, driven by growth across all regions, with strength in international and continued progress in North America. For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.4% sequentially and up 21.4% year-over-year.","For North American GP dentists, case volume was down 2.6% sequentially and up 15.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 2.9% sequentially and 35.1% year-over-year.","Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q3 was 4.7 cases per doctor, up slightly from 4.4 cases in Q3 last year. North America ortho utilization of 9.9 cases was a new record, increasing from 8.8 cases in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 2.9 cases, was up slightly from 2.8 cases in the prior year. And international doctor utilization of 4.6 cases was up slightly from 4.3 cases in the prior year.","In Q3 we added 2,260 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,060 of which were new North American doctors and 1,200 of which were new international doctors. Q3 is seasonally a slower training quarter due to holidays and summer vacations. So the number of Invisalign doctors trained was down approximately 8% sequentially. Our Scanner & Services revenues were up 7.8% sequentially and down 20.4% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the new iTero Element scanner, which didn't commence shipping until September.","Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, up sequentially 0.2 points and down 0.5 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 78.8%, up 0.5 points sequentially and down 0.04 points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by lower freight costs and seasonally lower training activity, which was only partially offset by the impact of the Additional Aligners policy.","The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower ASPs, primarily attributable to currency exchange rates and the new Additional Aligners policy, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Q3 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 14.7%, down 0.3 points sequentially and down 18.8 points year-over-year, both as a result of lower ASP due to a closeout incentive pricing program on our older iTero 2.9 scanner and lower production volumes.","Q3 operating expenses were $119.5 million, up sequentially by $3.2 million, primarily due to, first, increased investments to support our continued international growth and expansion and higher media spend. Secondly, costs primarily associated with severance costs for organizational changes previously announced. And third, costs related to the termination of an agreement with a third-party company for product development in the obstructive sleep apnea area. On this latter matter, while we continue to believe opportunities in the OSA market are potentially interesting, we've now decided to remain squarely focused on our core business and organic growth opportunities.","On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up $26 million, incidental to the growth of the business as well as our ERP implementation project. Our third quarter operating margin was 18.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 8.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to the impact on revenue of the new Additional Aligners policy, which amounted to 2.6 points, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.","The year-over-year impact relates primarily to these factors as well as foreign currency exchange rates and investments in the business related to sales expansion, R&D and ERP. With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 24.3%, down 1.9 points from our Q2 tax rate. This is primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the filing of our U.S. federal tax return this quarter.","Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.34 compared to $0.39 reported in Q2 and $0.47 reported in the same quarter last year. Third quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.06 related to the company's new Additional Aligners policy. Further, the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, including the decline on revenues, the benefit on our non-U.S. dollar operating expenses, together with currency exchange losses reported in other income and expense, was $0.04 per share.","Moving on to the balance sheet, capital expenditures for the third quarter were $10.5 million, primarily related to added equipment capacity to our second manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico as well as additional costs capitalized on our ERP project. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $60.1 million. And free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $49.6 million. As a side note, on a trailing 12-month basis our free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 22.7%, consistent with our long-term model target of 20% to 25%.","During the third quarter we repurchased 662,000 shares of stock, including 332,000 shares related to the completion of the company's previously announced $70 million accelerated stock repurchase and 330,000 shares, amounting to $18.8 million, in open market repurchases. As another side note, our last 12 months of stock repurchases, together with cash used to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock that otherwise would've been issued, amounted to 71% of our worldwide free cash flow. We believe our free cash flow generation and these repurchases are consistent with our expressed capital allocation objectives of returning cash flow in excess of that needed to run and grow the business to our shareholders.","Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $630 million. This compared to $602.6 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $27.4 million. Of our $630 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $213 million was held by the U.S. and $417 million held by our international entities.","With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For North America, we're encouraged by continued progress in North America, with Q3 volume growth rates above our three-year average. While we continue to gain share in the important teen segment, the fourth quarter has historically been a seasonally slower quarter for ortho teen case starts. Notwithstanding the seasonal pattern, we expect North American Invisalign case volume to be up sequentially from Q3.","For international, Q4 has historically been a seasonally stronger quarter for EMEA and a seasonally slower to flat quarter for APAC. In total, we expect international volumes to also be up sequentially from Q3.","As a reminder, the changes for the new Additional Aligners policy applied to all new Invisalign Full, Teen and Assist products, our full product group, shipped worldwide after July 18, 2015 as well as any such open cases started prior to this product policy change. As a result, beginning in Q3 our deferrals increased as a result of providing these Additional Aligners at no charge and the grandfathering of over 1 million open cases.","The effect on our future revenue is two-fold. The first is an increase in the amount we defer for each new case we ship. The second impact is that revenue recognized on each Additional Aligner shipment will be lower than the amounts we've historically recognized until these grandfathered cases are completed, which we anticipate will take approximately two years.","As a result of this policy change, we expect Q4 2015 to be lower than it otherwise would've been by approximately $7 million to $8 million. This is consistent with the guidance we gave in our Q2 earnings call.","For 2016, we expect this impact to be between $25 million and $30 million in total. Relative to our historical growth rates, we believe the current-year clear aligner volume growth will more than offset this impact on future revenues.","With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 154,900 cases to 157,400 cases, up approximately 22% to 24% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $223 million to $227.9 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75.7% to 76.2%. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $114.7 million to $116.3 million. Our operating margin should be in the range of 24.3% to 25.1%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24.5%. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, David. I'm pleased with our Q3 results, which reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and their confidence in using Invisalign on more patients and on more complex cases. Our goal is to be the best partner by providing great treatment experiences for our doctors and their patients. Overall, we continue to see good momentum across our customers' channels and believe our investments in sales, marketing and R&D are helping to drive growth. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our progress.","With that, we'll open up the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this afternoon. A couple of questions on guidance. First, it looks like guidance implies that ASPs will be up sequentially in the fourth quarter versus the third, if I'm doing that math right. Just wondering if you could give us some more details on your expectations for both North America and international ASPs. I think there are a decent amount of moving pieces just with the revenue recognition change, FX and case mix.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Hi, Nathan, it's David. Thanks for the question. As it relates to ASPs in the fourth quarter and the outlook as it relates there, too, we are expecting a modest increase in ASPs in Q4, not actually that substantial, primarily due to fewer promotions we run in Q4 versus what we typically do in third quarter. The other piece of it is that we implemented a price increase internationally in July and it takes a while for that price increase to work its way through work-in-process and cases that are in various stages of submission. And so ,we only got a partial benefit of that last quarter. We expect to get full benefit of that this quarter. So, those are the two things factoring from a positive standpoint. There is a little bit of FX headwind, but not very much, but a little bit positive on the ASP.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, makes sense. And then, if I could just ask on the operating margin guidance as well. It looks like for the fourth quarter you are expecting a pretty big step up in EBIT margins. Just wanted to get your sense of how much visibility you feel like you have here? Is it just a factor of sort of leveraging higher sales volumes? And maybe could you talk about the productivity of the sales people that you've brought on and how you feel about that return on investment?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So, possibly two questions there. As it relates to operating margin, our Q4 visibility, if you kind of drill down a little bit into it, you'll see that our guidance for gross margin is pretty consistent with our actual results in Q3. And where the uplift really in operating margin in Q4 comes from is the fact that our operating expenses are going down slightly quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue. And so that's the principal driver. I think it's about nine points of the operating margin increase quarter-over-quarter is that factor right there.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Nathan. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I'll ask two, one for Joe, and then, sorry, is Roger on the call as well?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So first for Joe. So, Joe, could you take a step back and just talk about the volumes and maybe rank-order what the drivers are? If you take a step back and say we have growth that's materially above 20%, you listed off quite a few items that the company did well during the quarter. But if you had to look at one or two things and say, look, this is really what has sequentially come on and made the business grow faster here in 2015, what would those one or two things be and how do you see those evolving from here?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think versus last year is, first of all, you have to look at North America. I mean, it's the strongest comparison that we have year-over-year because they did have a poor 2014 then. And so if you look at, the growth has been there, the orthodontic sector has been terrific for us. You can see we have a penetration rate there that's a record at 9.9. And so that's very significant. We are seeing growth again in the GP area and double-digit growth that we hadn't experienced in North America prior to that in the few previous years.","So I think overall that's probably one of the biggest variance I'd say year-to-year. What we had from a continuous standpoint, is you can see the terrific growth we have going on in EMEA right now in Europe and also the continued growth that we have in APAC also, which is very strong. And so, that's continued momentum and it's also on top of some pretty strong numbers from last year. So, I think those four variables I would say, Steve, overall are the big drivers.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You haven't been, I'd, say wildly optimistic about GP. I mean do you think the double-digit growth in GP is sustainable in North America?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I think there's an aspect of GP that we don't go deep in GP right now, we go wide. So you can see we have about 2.9 or 3 cases per GP unit versus 9.9 cases on ortho. As we add sales people, we know we get more sales in GP. We have to work on and I think what you said, I haven't talked about that a lot, I'm not enthusiastic about it I think what your words were. I am, it's just we have to do better at penetration in that segment and that's what we really have to work on.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one for Roger, I think, first of all, welcome back to the call, Roger.","Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I know this is your favorite part of the job. The SmileCareClub litigation was, I guess, a little surprising. How big are they right now? Are they even 2% or 3% of the market? And I guess while we're on the legal topic, I mean, what do you think the timelines could be as it relates to some enforcement around ClearCorrect?","Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.","Sure. So as far as the market size of SmileCareClub, it's negligible. We don't see them that much out there. As far as timing on ClearCorrect, the case at the ITC was appealed up through the federal courts, most recently at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and oral arguments were held in August. And we expect a written decision from the court sometime in the first quarter of next year.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much, everyone.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, just to follow up on the last question about key growth drivers. What's your assessment about the underlying market growth, particularly for orthodontists? Would you characterize it as stable or are you seeing any improvement there?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","You mean from a market overall, John, you mean outside of us or just the market itself?","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. So in other words, looking at that 23% case growth, how much of that if any do you think is market?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I think we have a favorable market behind us, John, is the way that I'd answer that question. I mean, we don't have a down market behind us, and that kind of market momentum is really helpful. To tell you how many points of growth that I think have to do with the market itself versus what we're driving from a penetration standpoint, I really don't have that kind of information. And so, I can't give you the specifics like that. But it's beneficial to have a market that's growing behind you.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","And typically, John, as you know, the industry has typically grown in low single-digits. And so nothing substantial has changed in that standpoint.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. And Joe, as you've had a bit more time to kick the tires, so to speak, around the world can you maybe comment on what your priorities are going to be over the next year?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, I mean priority is obviously growth in profitability overall for the company from a growth standpoint, John, staying on your original question. The international part is a big part of our growth and where you're going to see us continue to invest heavily in that area to drive the growth that we think we can get there. But that doesn't mean we'll negate North America. North America is a big market. There is kind of a lot of a law of large number issue in North America, we report lower percentages. But when you look at case volumes, they could be fairly close together. And so you'll see us continue to invest pretty aggressively from a distribution standpoint in all three regions.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then one last one, now that you've had a few months to assess how clients are viewing the new policy about not charging for additional aligner refinements. How is that impacting client behavior if at all, and are there sort of key regions where that has been a bigger driver than others?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I think you can ask that question two ways, John. Is it a negative driver in the sense we see people trying to maybe take advantage of the policy? And then the other side of it is how comfortable does it make our customer base. We haven't seen any variant that would say that this is being abused in some way. And really I've been personally amazed that a number of comments that I get really all over the world on that change. And there is no question it is exactly the way the team represented us before I got here is that this was the number one biggest attractor that we had in the marketplace regarding our product and our policies.","I'll give you an example. We talked about in our script about the Spain program that we had this year and that we just got back from. I had several doctors come up to me and just say, you know, Joe, it really increases my clinical confidence to have this policy changed. And they said because we feel like you have our back, if we run into an issue with something. It's a difficult case in some way, we don't feel like we're stranded. And I never thought that that would be one of the side effects or secondary effects of making that kind of a change. So it's been overwhelmingly received in a very positive way. And I think some of the surveys that I know you guys do and that I read, you can see a lot of the dentists that are surveyed on this will tell you that they feel happy about that and they'll be more aggressive about using Invisalign in the future, and that was the purpose of what we did.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay, John. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good afternoon. This is Robbie actually in for Rich. Thank you for taking the questions. Actually, I had one follow-up on some of the doctor comments that you had made about GP adoption. Just curious in terms of, it sounds like you expect GP year-over-year growth to continue in that double-digit range. In terms of the doctors that you guys trained in the quarter, do you give any breakout in terms of how many of those are GPs versus orthodontics?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Okay.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","We do have data to tell you how many. I think David will take you through that.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","I think if you look at the website slides, we probably break it out.","Unknown Speaker","And is that number like new doctors?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","North America total?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","North America total.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah, total.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, but that doesn't break down...","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Most of the doctors we train are GPs, right?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes. Correct.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","So if you guys recall historically and you can probably look at some of the historical data that we used to provide, but most of the doctors in North America are GPs.","Unknown Speaker","And is that level increasing historically, or is it still \u2013 it's most and that's what we should expect going forward?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","No, you should expect that going forward most of the doctors we train will be GPs.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","In the North America.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Yes, in North America.","Unknown Speaker","Great, thanks. And then maybe one on litigation. Is there any read-through on this California dismissal with ITC that both you guys have now dismissed that lawsuit against one another to a potential settlement with the ITC litigation?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Can you repeat that, I didn't hear the first part of that.","Unknown Speaker","Should we take the dismissal of the litigation in California by both parties as any sort of indication that there could be a settlement or are you just \u2013 should we just assume that you're willing to hear the ITC case play out?","Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.","You should not assume there will be a settlement.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. And then maybe one more on the Scanners business, this came in a little bit lower than we had expected. Any sort of \u2013 was that just seasonality or are you seeing any sort of capital challenges in that business there?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So, (sic) Robbie, on the Scanner business it really has little to do I think with seasonality and everything to do with the cycle we're at in terms of transitioning from our historical Scanner, which we called 2.9, to our new scanner called Element. And we began shipping that product in September and up until that point in time we had been winding down the sale of the older 2.9. So it's more a function of that than anything else.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Joe, I wanted to start with you maybe, strong fourth quarter guidance on the case shipments. So I think I know the answer to this already. But are you seeing any fade at all in China from a demand standpoint? In the U.S. a little concern that maybe we started to see some consumer softening kind of in the September time period in that. Are you seeing anything in your kind of month-to-month numbers that would worry you, either China or the U.S., at this point?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","The quick answer, Jeff, is no. China continues to be very strong. We had a good, strong September here in North America, too. I understand the basis of your question; I worry about it, too. What's the economic activity going on in those particular areas? But right now I'm not seeing any effect on the business in that sense.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that's what your guidance would imply, too, so thanks. And then, David, maybe just a clarifying question for you on the Additional Aligner policy. I'm going back to my notes here, but the guidance you gave for the revenue impact in 2016, the $25 million to $30 million, that's the total revenue drag from that policy in 2016 versus what looks like it's now going to be a $13 million or $14 million drag in 2015. So the incremental drag, if you will, is only about $12 million to $15 million, is that the way to think about it?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","That's correct and that's primarily because it's only a six-month drag on 2015.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, yeah. Fair enough. I just wanted to make sure. And then my last question just I guess with Roger there I'll ask him, but I thought I remembered, guys, that with the ClearCorrect ITC ruling that even in appeals they could be risking some hefty day-to-day fines if they were still digitally treatment planning. So wondering, one, am I right on that? And two, does that mean anything in conjunction with what you said about them potentially treatment planning the SmileCareClub cases, and just wondering if there is any impact to potential risk there from that standpoint for them?","Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.","I don't remember specifically what the ruling is on damages in the interim, but it's continued infringement from our point of view. And it doesn't affect, I mean it's the same thing, whether they are doing it for themselves or whether they are doing it for SmileCareClub.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe I'll ask a couple more offline on that later tonight. Thanks, guys.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll focus on utilization. I guess the year-over-year GP utilization was up for the second straight quarter after being down every quarter in 2014. So, Joe, can you talk about the sustainability here with that increase, with the greater sales rep count, and maybe where you are with the sales initiative in that really long GP tail? And then part two to that would be, in the ortho channel the utilization increases have been huge. And can that continue with the current call it G portfolio or should we expect you'll need another iteration on that front?","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Hi, Jon, I think on the ortho channel side \u2013 I'll just start with that question before I back up what GP is. I think you'll see, just getting used to the statistics in this business, but I think you'll see that it normally goes down from third quarter to fourth quarter on the penetration rate. And it has to do with the teen cases that tend to come in in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So I think what you might you see is a little lower penetration rate on the ortho side for North America as we go into the fourth quarter. But that's just statistical and based on year-to-year. There is nothing in a sense of the demand pattern to think that we see any interest that we have in orthos on that.","On the GP side, Jon, I'm just \u2013 again, my newness in this business makes me more cautious than I normally am. But what the correlation I see right now on the GP side is you have to make sure that you continue to approach this market in the GP side with sales people, because it's hard for us to have any really meaningful increase when you look at the amount of utilization that's going on in that channel. And so we've proven so far I think in 2015 is if you add sales people to this, there is a marketplace we can continue to get growth.","There are some sales models that we're transferring in from \u2013 in Europe from a penetration standpoint \u2013 that we're going to employ in North America next year as a trial to see if we can help with some of that penetration. That will apply both to ortho and GP, too. Secondly is, and we talked to you before about the sales associates that we've added recently, which are basically what I would say back office support that actually make phone calls and all to customers andnot direct. We've seen some success with that model, too, and I think that might help us on the GP sector also in the sense of how do we go about that, how do we really \u2013 I've talked about this before too, Jon \u2013 how do we really segment that marketplace to see where we think we can get further penetration with doctors that are truly interested and taking Invisalign to another level, versus doctors that might just be curious on it and wanting to work with it, not necessarily in the in-depth way that we would want.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Very helpful. And then...","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","And that's a lot...","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It's a lot, but it's all very helpful. So I appreciate that. And then, David, just to shift gears for a second, you got the question earlier on leverage and your commentary was, well, revenues are up and OpEx is down and that doesn't happen too frequently. And I'm not asking for a 2016 guidance, but I just want to make sure, we've had situations before where your 4Q to 1Q, your leverage is usually down pretty dramatically because you've got some one-time expenses that sort of get re-upped. Can you give any color around leverage as we look out, exiting sort of 2015 into 2016, maybe near-term, long-term? Because again, the move from 3Q to 4Q is just tremendous. Is there anything that comes back into play on the OpEx front once we enter 2016? Thanks, guys.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So, to the first part of that that you asked as it relates to some of the seasonality you might see in our performance, financially and so forth, you're right to call that Q1 typically is down for us. And largely, for things that are external to the company like the fact that payroll taxes start over. We have a lot of employees here in the U.S. whose payroll taxes start over and our portion of that that we have to pay. At the same time, we have internal items that influence that, such as we have focal salary reviews and increases \u2013 performance reviews and increases at that point in time. So those all put pressure, you might say, on operating expense uplift in Q1.","And then, when you add to that the fact that, when we go through our annual operating plan cycle, we go through a process that looks at basically our baseline organic business in terms of what do we think our business can sustain without any additional resources, and then we look at that relative to where do we have investment opportunities and how would those investment opportunities drive both short-term as well as long-term growth of the top line and penetration into the business. And a lot of times, those investments all get made early in the beginning of the year as well, and this last year \u2013 this year that we're currently in is a case in point. We made investments in all three of our regions at the beginning of the year to begin driving further penetration within existing doctors and bringing new doctors into the family, so to speak.","So there is that piece of it. I think you should anticipate that we will, as our historical pattern has shown, that we'll be making large investments, incremental investments as we move into 2016 and that that will create some downward pressure on Q1. And hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year, we begin seeing a lot of uplift to our business as we're seeing this year.","Longer-term than that, Joe mentioned the fact that we see a pretty good correlation between our investments that we make in the field and investments that we make in products, one driving adoption, the other driving doctor coverage and so forth. I think that will be our business for a while. I think our challenge long-term is finding the right balance between the investments that we believe we can execute on, and at the same time, be good caretakers of being financially responsible for finding that right balance between our short-term performance and our long-term performance. So our long-term model that we've talked about historically, we still believe that's the right model for us, and that's where we'll continue to strive the business.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. All right. Thanks, guys.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from ROTH Capital Partners. Mr. Lewis, your line is live.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Chris, are you there?","Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Hey, guys, can you hear me all right?","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, there you are. Yeah, we can hear you fine.","Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Sorry about that. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the fourth quarter gross margin guidance. When I think about ASPs ticking up sequentially along with the strong implied sequential case volume growth, midpoint of the fourth quarter gross margin guidance implies a flattish level from the third quarter. So can you just walk us through the factors that are layering into that outlook, despite the sequential ASP and volume pick up?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","Well, we do have some ASP uplift. But we also have a higher training volume during this quarter, which typically is with lower gross margin. So that tends to hold some of that uplift back as a result. The other piece of it is that we are shipping our Element product this quarter, and Element, although it is a much better business model, you might say, for our company in many respects and I think also for the doctor and it does have a higher gross margin than the older version, it is still below our clear aligner overall gross margin. And so as that Element business picks up, that also puts some downward pressure, you might say, on the gross margin, just from a mix standpoint.","Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Then on the OSA market opportunity, can you talk about that decision and potentially quantify the impact that will have on R&D spend going forward? Thanks.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","I'll let David do the quantification, Chris. I'd say that when you look at that, it's not that we didn't that OSA was a good market. In fact, it might be a good market for some company at some point in time in the sense of how that can compete against other kinds of opportunities out there. But from us, we have I feel much better places in our core market to invest that money right now and that's what we're going to do in the future is just stay focused.","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","And back to your question about impact, we gave some guidance at the beginning of the year that we thought OSA would be somewhere around a 1 point cost on revenue. And you'll see in the slides that we've provided on the webcast in the quarter the wind-down cost on that was about $0.02 a share.","Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Chris. See you.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Hey, Rich?","Unknown Speaker","Hi, thanks. It's actually Robbie. Thanks for taking the follow-up again.","Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.","Oh, sorry. Hi, Robbie.","Unknown Speaker","No problem. I have a question maybe on ASPs for sort of by product segment, the Express and Light segment. It looks like it's stepped down a little bit again sequentially. How should we think about that going forward in terms of is this the new normal or should we continue to expect price declines from this area?","David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.","So, Robbie, as we've talked about in the past, there's a lot of variables that make up our ASP. And they come down \u2013 if I summarize them at the highest level, they come down to product mix, doctor mix, and \u2013 let me focus on those two for a second.","So when you look at product mix, certainly lower-stage products and so forth are going to drive down \u2013 all other things being equal, a richer mix of lower-stage products will obviously bring ASPs down.","And from time to time you're going to see us running promotions and so forth to incent doctors to give those low-stage cases, prize and so forth. But ultimately an objective for many doctors is to treat those and to get them to not only treat the simple cases but get them to build their clinical confidence on those simple cases and begin adopting full cases, where they feel they're capable and confident that they can do so. So you're going to see some ups and downs on product mix.","And as we introduce new products in the future and so forth, I think you can anticipate that most of our R&D effort is focused on improving the clinical efficacy in those more complex cases. I think you'll see pressure from a product mix standpoint going in the other direction. So I wouldn't be too fixated I think on the last quarter or so as we ran some promotions on that case. We've said over time that over the long period we think ASPs can be relatively stable, plus or minus. And the other piece that kind of enters into it, the second piece I forgot to mention is when you look at the types of doctors we're bringing in. So as we dabble and penetrate and so forth the GP market, those doctors that are submitting lower cases are typically paying higher prices for those cases. As those doctors get engaged, whether they're GPs or orthos, they have an opportunity to participate in volume discounts.","And so as we improve utilization in either the GP channel or in the ortho channel, we basically share, you might say, with those doctors some of the economic benefits of that adoption from the standpoint they get higher discounts and of course we're getting more volume as a result. And depending upon how that mix is from one quarter to the next, you're going to see some volatility, you might say, in ASPs. So for example in Q3 we know it's a heavy quarter for teens, particularly here in North America, and that typically goes to orthos. And when you look at ortho adoption, our ortho doctors are typically the ones that participate more regularly in those advantage pricing tiers and so forth.","So I wouldn't get too fixated with some ups and downs that you're going to see quarter-to-quarter. And as I said a minute ago, over the long term we think ASPs will be stable, plus or minus.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you for the very detailed response.

We still include a large amount of information in our corresponding slide presentation, and we've added several new pages to this quarter's slide deck, which is posted on our Investor Relations website at investor.aligntech.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligners and the Scanner and CAD\/CAM services business. We're pleased to report another good quarter with better-than-expected revenues, gross margin and earnings. Strong second quarter results were driven by higher Invisalign volumes and ASPs, with sequential growth across all customer channels.","For Q2, total Invisalign case shipments grew across all customer channels to over 100,000 cases worldwide for the first time, with a total of 106,100 cases shipped. The year-over-year growth was driven by continued expansion of our customer base and increased Invisalign utilization. The sequential increase in Q2 reflects strong growth from our international doctors, as well as good growth from both North American GP dentists and orthodontists.","Virtually all Invisalign products were up nicely year-over-year and sequentially. The exception was Invisalign Assist, which has been flat for the past few quarters as doctors have shifted to Invisalign Full and Teen cases more frequently. This is a natural progression as newly trained doctors become more experienced users and want to leverage the full offering.","Acceleration of our new product development cycle and key feature improvements, such as Invisalign G4 and our new SmartTrack material, are helping drive increased utilization of Invisalign globally, especially among our higher volume customers. We continue to see good adoption and growth of Invisalign worldwide among more experienced customers, driven by increased confidence in the clinical outcomes, especially for more complex treatments, especially including teenagers.","Q2 marks the beginning of the busy teen season for orthodontic case starts, as reflected by strong growth in Invisalign case shipments to teenage patients. Total teenagers treated with Invisalign increased to 23,500 cases in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 16% and a sequential increase of 2%.","In Q2, we started to see the positive impact from expansion of our clear aligner product line, with value-based offerings like Express 5. These products are targeted to patients declining comprehensive treatment but who still want minor malocclusions treated.","During Q2, we continue to see strong sequential growth from our value-based offerings, driven by better-than-expected demand for Invisalign Express 5 in North America and Invisalign i7 in Europe. Both of these offerings meet an important need for patients who want minor correction rather than comprehensive orthodontic treatment at least for now.","Now let's shift to talk about customers and geographies, starting with a review of the key metrics around Invisalign in utilization and training. We continue to focus on building our customer base and driving increased utilization among new and existing practices. For Q2, total Invisalign utilization was 4.4 cases per doctor, an increase from 4.3 in Q1 2013 and Q2 2012, driven primarily by North American orthos and international doctors.","In Q2 of 2013, we added 115 new active American orthos, 1,015 North American GPs and 1,020 international doctors for a total of 2,150 new Invisalign doctors.","For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume of 39,500 cases increased 11.6% year-over-year, reflecting cases from new doctors, as well as increased utilization of Invisalign.","Sequential growth of 4.1% was driven primarily by new submitting doctors, which reflects our focus on reengaging orthodontists who are Invisalign trained but have not actively used Invisalign in their practice for many years.","For North American GP dentists, Q2 case volume of 39,300 cases increased 5.5% year-over-year and 7.1% sequentially, reflecting continued expansion of our GP customer base, as well as increased utilization.","Q2 case shipments for our international doctors of 23 point -- 27,300 cases increased 20.7% year-over-year and 16.3% sequentially, reflecting strong growth from direct European countries while we continue to focus on product innovation and clinical education, which is resonating especially well among our orthodontic customers.","All direct country geographies across Europe increased nicely despite widespread economic challenges, with notable growth in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Spain, as well as the U.K., which appears to be rebounding. France continues to post the highest growth rate among our direct European countries, albeit off of a relatively small base of customers as making real progress in the Teen segment.","Towards the end of Q2, we held our largest ever international summit in Rome, which focused on peer-to-peer learning and sharing of clinical techniques and case studies of more complex malocclusions. We believe it was the best international summit to date with over 300 Invisalign practices represented, mostly from Europe, as well as 50 doctors from the Asia Pacific region. These doctors were blown away by the complexity of cases and the quality of finishes shown.","These doctors routinely treat the most complex cases and they're excited about our continued cycle of innovation and the significant improvements represented by G4 and SmartTrack, which are essential to treating these more difficult cases.","I'll turn to Asia Pacific now. And prior to Q2, Japan and China were our only direct countries in the Asia Pacific region. But during this last quarter, we successfully completed the transition of countries managed by our Asia Pacific distributor back to direct sales and management by Align. More specifically, 6 country markets, including Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau and Malaysia are now part of the direct Invisalign sales region. And on May 1, we began to recognize direct sales at our full Invisalign average sales price or ASP, rather than a significantly discounted ASP under the distribution agreement.","We now have an additional 47 employees in our Pan Asia operations. The remaining 7 country markets of Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam will continue under the current distribution model but are now managed by our Align team.","Our Managing Director for APAC, Julie Tay, is based in the middle of this important geography and has our new offices in Singapore up and running.","I am very excited by the progress she's already made in building a Pan Asia Pacific organization and believe she and the team will help take this entire region to the next level in the coming years.","I'll now briefly discuss our Q2 performance in our traditional direct countries, Japan and China, which continue to represent great growth opportunities for Align. In Japan, Q2 was another strong quarter for Invisalign case shipments, and we are pleased to see continued progress in this market. Growth was driven primarily by increased utilization, resulting from improved clinical confidence in Invisalign. While the Japanese market is still very early in development and small in terms of impact, we believe we can grow strongly over time.","We're also starting to see increased awareness of the value of a beautiful smile that can be achieved through orthodontic treatment, including through clear aligner therapy and believe Invisalign can be a catalyst for real market growth.","Q2 was a good quarter for China, with very strong year-over-year growth and increased repeat usage by doctors, demonstrating the depth of our current doctor base. We continue to gain traction in China by executing our strategy of gaining key endorsement and adoption of Invisalign from key universities and opinion leaders through professional education and clinical support.","During Q2, 15 Chinese key opinion leaders, or KOLs, attended the Invisalign summit in Rome, which resulted in a very positive feedback about the product and increased confidence in what can be treated successfully with Invisalign. In addition, 75 key decision makers from 40 of China's leading private clinics attended our first Invisalign private clinic forum in Hangzhou, resulting in positive endorsement for how Invisalign can help build their practices.","Finally, we are increasing our partnerships with top private practices that are actively promoting Invisalign on their own and want to build their own brands and reputations by aligning themselves with the world's leading clear aligner player, Invisalign.","In Q2, we announced our first North American distribution agreement for an entry-level clear aligner product. I want to briefly recap the highlights from the launch of Realine, and initial response from our distribution partner, Henry Schein Dental.","Realine is a 5-stage clear aligner product for cosmetic fixes and minor crowding and spacing issues, such as dental relapse. Realine offers GP dentists who are not currently using Invisalign to innovative technology and quality of Invisalign aligners as a competitively priced, easy-to-use product for patients with very simple treatment goals, especially among adults. There are approximately 100 million adult consumers in the U.S. alone that would like to improve their smile and are interested in straighter teeth, but many say they would never consider braces or even seek out an orthodontic consultation.","Over the past 12 years, Align has driven category growth in orthodontics by offering a clear aligner solution that especially appeals to adult patients and by making Invisalign clear aligner therapy to Invisalign trained orthodontists and GP practices. We announced Realine on June 6 and launched it to Henry Schein Dental sales team at their national meeting that same week. The product and distribution partnership received a great reception from their sales team, along with management with Realine selected as best new product of the sales meeting.","That enthusiasm is good to have as all marketing and sales for Realine is being handled by Schein Dental.","Realine became commercially available in mid-June, and we're pleased with the initial interest received from doctors. The Realine professional website had more than 2,500 doctor visits in its first couple of weeks, and the first Realine starter kits have now shipped.","Shifting now slightly to marketing and consumers. In May, we launched a completely new and fully integrated consumer advertising campaign in North America. The new campaign continues our focus on women and moms of teenagers, and its launch was timed to leverage the busy teen orthodontic season, which runs from late spring until some time after Labor Day. While our consumer advertising is always focused on great outcomes and a healthy beautiful smile is possible with Invisalign, the new Better Smile Everyday campaign is focused on the great treatment journey with Invisalign, where treatment doesn't detract from your everyday life or require you to put any part of your life on hold during treatment.","Initial metrics influenced by advertising, particularly TV ads, are strong. For example, we had nearly 2.5 million visitors in invisalign.com through the end of Q2, an all-time high and a strong indicator of consumer awareness and interest in Invisalign treatment.","I'd like now to shift to our Scanner and CAD\/CAM services segment, where Invisalign utilization among scanner customers, particularly orthodontists, continues to grow and we expect this positive trend to continue. The drivers for this growth come from better customer and patient experience, driven by recent scanner innovations, including our new iTero scanner, which began shipping in February.","In addition, the recently launched Invisalign Outcome Simulator brings a valuable patient education tool right to chair-side, to help doctors show the benefits of Invisalign treatment to prospective patients.","We continue to see an increase in Invisalign case submissions from a digitally scanned impression instead of a traditional PVS impression. The percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scan, rather than PVS, rose to 22% in Q2 compared to 19% in Q1 and 12% in Q2 a year ago.","This trend is positive for both Align and our customers, as most practices reported faster ClinCheck turnaround and case shipment, with less hassle to patients. And all reports to date indicate better aligner fit.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Roger for a review of our Q2 financial results. Roger?","Roger E. George","Thanks, Tom. In my comments today, I will not review the total dollars excluded for non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense and operating margin and instead, refer you to our press release tables entitled Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Key Financial Metrics and Business Outlook Summary for a complete reconciliation.","Let's review our second quarter financial results. Q2 net revenue was a total of $163.8 million, which consisted of Invisalign revenue of $153.3 million and Scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue of $10.5 million. Q2 net revenue increased 6.7% from $153.6 million in Q1 of 2013 and 12.5% from $145.6 million in Q2 of 2012. Year-over-year revenue growth reflects increased Invisalign volume and higher ASPs, primarily from the transition of our APAC distributor into a direct sales region. The sequential increase in revenue primarily reflects higher Invisalign case shipments, driven by both North America and international, as well as higher international ASPs.","Recall that for Q1 '13, clear aligner revenue includes $4.4 million from consolidating Vivera Retainer product shipments down to 1 per year. In addition, beginning June 15, 2013, we are no longer charging a fee associated with our midcourse correction orders. And as a result, Invisalign clear aligner revenue for Q2 of '13 was decreased by $1.2 million, which reflects the revenue deferred to provide free midcourse correction for open cases shipped between April 1 through June 15, 2013 that are now eligible for the new midcourse correction policy.","In Q1 of '13, Invisalign clear aligner revenue was decreased by $2.7 million, which reflected the estimated deferred revenue for open cases as of March 31, 2013, that were expected to be eligible for the new policy. Q2 Invisalign revenue of $153.3 million increased 8.3% compared to Q1 revenue of $141.6 million, and increased 14.7% compared to Q2 2012 revenue of $133.7 million.","The sequential increase in Q2 revenue reflects increased Invisalign volume and higher international ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign revenue growth was driven by increased Invisalign shipments and higher ASPs.","Q2 2013 Scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue was $10.5 million. This is a sequential decrease of 12.4% compared to Q1 revenues of $12 million and a decrease of 12% from Q2 last year. Q1 '13 Scanner and CAD\/CAM services revenue includes $1.4 million that was reserved in Q3 and Q4 of 2012 for the new iTero scanner upgrade program, which was launched in Q1 of '13. This upgrade program was successfully implemented and the full reserve was not utilized.","Q2 scanner shipments recognized were essentially flat from last quarter, but we had a record number of ortho scanners sold, reflecting our continued success in leveraging the Invisalign installed base of customers.","Moving on to the income statement to gross margin and operating expenses. Q2 GAAP gross margin was $123.7 million or 75.5%. This compares to $112.8 million or 73.5% in Q4, and $108.8 million or 74.7% in the same quarter last year. There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin this quarter or for Q1 '13 but compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $109 million or 74.9% in the same quarter last year. Q2 GAAP gross margin for Invisalign was 78.4%, and scanner and CAD\/CAM services gross margin was 33.9%. This compares to 77.2% and 29.3%, respectively in Q1 and 79% and 26.6%, respectively, in the same quarter last year.","For Invisalign, there is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 or Q1 2013 and Q2 2012. The sequential increase in gross margin primarily reflects higher Invisalign volume. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign gross margins declined slightly due to higher material costs for the SmartTrack aligner material.","For Scanner and CAD\/CAM services, there is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 or Q1 2013 but compares to non-GAAP gross margin of 28.4% in the same quarter last year. The sequential increase reflects lower manufacturing spend. On a year-over-year basis, scanner gross margins increased due to lower training cost and scanner standard cost.","Q2 GAAP operating expense was $85.8 million compared to Q1 '13 operating expense of $150.9 million and Q2 '12 operating expense of $72.8 million. Q1 '13 GAAP operating expense includes long-lived assets and goodwill impairment charges of $67 million.","There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses this quarter, but compares to non-GAAP operating expenses were $83.9 million in Q1 and $72.5 million in the same quarter last year.","The increase in Q2 operating expense is primarily due to higher TV media and advertising spending and includes expenses for our Asia Pacific operations as of May 1.","Q2 GAAP operating profit was $37.9 million or 23.1%. This compares to GAAP operating loss of $38.1 million or 24.8% negative in Q1 and operating profit of $36 million or 24.7% in the same quarter a year ago.","There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit this quarter but compares to non-GAAP operating profit of $28.9 million or 18.8% in Q1, and $36.5 million or 25.1% in the same quarter last year.","Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36 compared to diluted earnings per share of negative $0.52 in Q1 and earnings per share of $0.34 in the same quarter last year. There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS this quarter but compares to $0.26 in Q1 and $0.34 in Q2 of last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term investments, were $341.3 million. This is compared to $35.61 million(sic) [$356.1 million] at the end of 2012. In Q2, we generated roughly $53.3 million in cash from operations compared to $10.4 million in Q1 and $27.4 million in the same quarter last year.","During Q2, we purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $35.01 per share for a total of approximately $92.7 million. We have now completed the remaining authorized repurchases under our stock repurchase program.","Q2's days sales outstanding were 62 days compared to 64 days in Q1 and 63 days in the same quarter last year. Now let's turn to our business outlook for Q3 2013 and the factors that inform our view.","The first half of 2013 is off to a good start, and our customers continued to report stable patient traffic in their offices through June and into July. For North American orthos, most Teen case starts occur in the summer months, and we expect the positive impact we saw in Q2 from teenagers to continue into Q3.","In addition, busy Teen ortho practices typically means that they will have fewer adult consultations in order to accommodate the summer rush for kids before school starts.","Q3 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for North American GPs and international doctors who spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. This is especially true for the Southern European countries, where offices can be closed for weeks.","With these factors considered, we would expect Invisalign case volume for North American GPs and international doctors to be down sequentially from strong Q2 shipments. And we expect North American ortho volume to be up sequentially.","Our new midcourse correction policy took effect June 15, 2013 and we expect the usage rate for midcourse correction orders to approximate the revenue deferrals and will, therefore, offset each other going forward. In addition, as a result of no longer charging and billing customers for midcourse correction orders, we anticipate a reduction of approximately $700,000 per quarter, a small price for improving the Invisalign customer experience and helping doctors achieve great treatment outcomes for their patients.","For scanner and CAD\/CAM services, we expect revenue to be down sequentially from Q2, reflecting lower ASPs and an increasingly competitive environment.","With that as the backdrop, Q3 Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 103,600 to 106,100 cases, reflecting 12% to 15% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 total revenues to be in the range of $154.9 million to $160 million. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 73.7% to 74.2%. In Q3, we expect operating expense to be in the range of $84.8 million to $86.9 million, which primarily reflects higher legal fees and delayed headcount with some hires that took longer to get on board. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in a range of 19% to 19.8%, and EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.30.","In Q3, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 81.6 million and cash on hand to be in a range of $370 million to $380 million.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom for closing comments.","Thomas M. Prescott","Thanks, Roger. Overall, Q2 was another strong quarter and we're pleased with our continued progress. We have delivered solid execution on the important strategic initiatives currently underway.","The economy continues to be a challenge in many geographies, but patient traffic through the dental industry remains steady, notwithstanding the summer seasonality we expect to see in some of our doctors' offices.","The continued growth in Invisalign adoption and utilization worldwide is the result of continued investment in R&D, new product development, improved and expanded sales coverage and in major markets, supported by consumer demand programs.","The Invisalign product and customer experience keeps getting better and better, giving doctors confidence to use Invisalign on more patients, with increasing treatment complexity. This can really be seen in our teen patient population.","At the same time, we believe we're just beginning to address a real market need with Invisalign Express and i7 for patients who just want to fix minor malocclusions at an affordable price point. We're adding to this positive momentum with 2 new additions to our executive team. Today in a separate release, we announced that David White is joining Align as our new CFO, and John Graham who's joining us as our new VP of marketing and CMO. Both bring tremendous experience and energy to the organization and they are each excited about the opportunities ahead. You'll have the chance to get to know each of them as we update you on progress throughout the rest of the year.","Finally, I'd like to thank Roger George, Karen Silva and the rest of the finance team for doing a great job of taking care of business while our CFO search was underway. And with that, let's get right to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start with Teen. Obviously, some high expectations for this category over the summer months. And in fact, it really was the only segment where you didn't substantially beat our expectations. It looks like it grew about 16%. Last quarter year-over-year, you grew 27%. I think for the full year last year, you grew about that as well. So I was just curious how the Teen growth, obviously while strong, how it's been measuring up to your internal expectations?","Thomas M. Prescott","I will, first of all -- I think we're very comfortable with where we are with Teen and with a little lower sequential, I mean, this is not a completely linear business. We're very comfortable that given that there's 2 elements to that, there's international, there is North American orthos and there are GPs. GP channel fluctuated a bit more. The ortho channel continues to have very, very good year over growth rates. And in general, we're pleased. That positions us pretty well for the summer. I think the way we think about teen is it's a key growth opportunity, but it's going to be a steady climb given that Teens are the base business for orthos and they're going to convert -- continue to convert to Invisalign more cautiously than they will for adult patients. All the initiatives we've got underway, coverage, evolution of the product with G4, SmartTrack and all those things to support that, and we're comfortable that we're going to have a good strong Teen summer.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great, Tom. And then I guess, just my follow-up would be more broad, just around the operating margin guidance 19% to 19.8%. Relative to what you did this quarter, it looks like you're also guiding gross margins to decline sequentially into 3Q as well. I guess just maybe if you could spend a little time helping us think about the drop in profitability from this point, and then maybe if you're comfortable commenting on if you're still confident that you'll exit the year near that 25% operating margin level?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, I guess the Q3 guidance stands for itself and we're comfortable putting that out there. The fundamental driver in this business is volume. And if you take a look at the quarter we just reported, we did a little better on volume and a little better on pricing and we're getting up in that neighborhood of the low end of our model at 23% plus operating margin. So we expect volume to be down a bit in Q3, that's very typical if you look at every quarter over the last 6, 7, 8 years, it's been the case. And along -- and we're not going to just pull spending back in important strategic areas. So along the way, you're going to see a little less operating margin. But again, with the guidance out there for Q3, with our expectations that we typically build volume into Q4, we fully expect with all these initiatives coming online, that we can approach the low end of that long-term model, around that 25% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Tom, could you talk a bit more about what drove the surprisingly good ASP trend? Maybe if you did an apples-to-apples comparison with Asia, if you had that full in your P&L last year, what would the trend have been?","Thomas M. Prescott","I'm going to ask Karen to take that in just a minute, and I know that we didn't -- we're not modeling it for disclosure, we've modeled it internally. It was a contributor -- I'll start by saying the APAC revenue for 2\/3 of the quarter, May, June, was a contributor. And probably the bigger contributor was net ASP in North America, where we had larger participation with some lower volume customers re-engaging with Orthos and some GPs and didn't participate as heavily on the Advantage side. That was a big factor. If we take that, plus some smaller factors, a little positive FX and then Asia Pacific, you've got them together. And I'll ask Karen Silva, our VP of Finance, to maybe comment a little more.","Karen Silva","Sure, Tom. Thanks. So for the quarter, we experienced several million dollars from an uptick from the Asia Pacific. They came on, we plot them as of May 1. So we have 2 months under our belt, and so we expect that will move forward in the future quarters. And offsetting that, of course, will be additional sales and marketing spend, which we took on the majority of their sales team and that continue as well.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to that. Do you still view the longer term trend in ASP to be down due to mix or is your thinking about that changing?","Thomas M. Prescott","So, I think, over time, we would expect, as the low-end offerings grow for minor malocclusions, we expect mix to be -- to bring ASP down total. I think the team put together a couple of new slides based on a lot of questions like this, and we try to break out the elements there. I think if you look into that, you can see that stable to up. You'll be able to separate mix-driven change from what we'll call real price. But the biggest factor driving it down, in general, is going to be mix. The second factor would be probably Advantage among high-volume customers, but you can intuit that from the breakout we're giving you now.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then one last one. After the favorable ruling that you got during the quarter, from the ITC, have you seen that have any impact on volumes or market share? Would you expect in the second half of the year or is that more of a longer term opportunity in your view?","Thomas M. Prescott","From our perspective, if there's any volume, it's very small and I think this is really more about asserting the right IP so we continue to build the business for our customers and shareholders over the longer term.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Real solid quarter, so I guess I had to be picky, if you would. But North American ortho, I mean, maybe that was the only area that didn't blowout our numbers. So can you speak to what's going on with SmartTrack and how it's being received there, what it's doing to utilization? And then also, Tom, just as a function of that, are you hearing from the field that it's helping the guys shorten treatment time? We've done some work there, and if so, how is that being received from the doctors?","Thomas M. Prescott","Let me start there, John. We've got no sound clinical data at a level that we could claim it. There's a lot of experimentation going on with treatment cycles and adjunctive therapy. But, from our perspective, we're not anywhere near where we'd want to posit a change in treatment times. So I'll start there. We're very comfortable with where we are in ortho, and one of the dynamics this last quarter is that we're engaging with some really good practices that have not been customers of Invisalign for quite a long time. And they are reengaging with us, seeing what can be done and they're just sort of not really Advantage customers. They are now getting trial and usage, and some of them throw in 5 or 10 cases where we haven't seen anything before. So what you see is a tail growing on the ortho side. That actually was a contributor to less Advantage, a higher ASP. The specific answer to your question on innovations like SmartTrack and the big release or two we do a year, right, the G4, SmartTrack, et cetera, is that our core base of orthos and GPs and international doctors will get experience with that quickly, given the volume, and they will immediately start changing behavior. Doing more complex cases, doing more teens, for example, and then that steadies out over time. What's going on now is what I just spoke about the moment ago, where the less frequent ortho submitters, the doctors that are using us less, are actually trying it more, becoming more comfortable, actually seeing a change in the product. They're just not as frequent users and so they're not getting as rapid a feedback, but we're getting very good traction there. So what I'd say is that this is a very consistent transition, with the early adopters and frequent users getting the biggest bang for the buck, and then working down through the base of users. But, again, them taking longer to recognize those advantages, but leading to utilization. So it's another reason, with the base growing on GP and the active base growing a bit on ortho while utilization is flattish for both. But this is the good news story underneath that.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, that make sense, and then that dovetails into my next question, which is -- I don't have the number right in front of me, but number of GPs trained, I think you said, it was over 1,000. That was well above where we were, and that actually sort of goes back to pre-proficiency noise. I hate to use that word again, but I mean where big time guys were coming on board, you were partnering with these doctors and they were excited to be part of the Invisalign story. So can you talk to like what's going on in the field? I mean, is that sort of the feeling out there and they have now allotted their disposal between Express 10 and Express 5, et cetera, where these guys realize, I want to be doing Invisalign because it's an additional revenue kicker to my practice and that's leading to a really impressive new doc numbers?","Thomas M. Prescott","Well, there's a whole set of reasons why an orthodontist or a dentist, that wasn't doing Invisalign, comes to Invisalign, and it starts with their patient interest. Patients are asking doctor, why don't you do this? It comes due to the fact that they have got good clinical reasons for not doing it. They have a busy restorative practice, yet they're influenced by friends. It fits well into a good restorative cosmetic dental practice. On the ortho side, the docs that really weren't our customers -- I'll stay on GP for a moment and come back to ortho. We did train over 1,000, and we see strong interest out there, in adding Invisalign to practice. It is one of the best practice building vehicles, today, in general dentistry for sure. On the ortho side, I think the biggest vector there is the evolution of product and the customer experience. The product just is getting better and, along with that, they're more comfortable, they don't have to make compromises on the finishes they can promise to mom and dad for a teenager or to the patients themself. But that is a journey, but we are in the process of reengaging there. We trained up almost 120 orthos, that's a big number for us, plus the number is coming out of universities which are small classes. But I'll call that a good step in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Roger, I was hoping I could start with you, just one more question on third quarter guidance, if I could. The OpEx commentary on sales force was helpful on why that might be dragging margin down a little bit more next quarter. And, obviously, Tom's comments on volumes make sense from a fixed cost leverage standpoint. But why gross margin? Why would gross margin be down a bit next quarter with the higher ASPs from Asia Pac if you had gross margin up year-over-year this quarter? Why would gross margin go what down year-over-year next quarter? Just trying to understand that better.","Roger E. George","Jeff, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Karen to pull the numbers out to give you the quantitative answer. So give us a second would you?","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And maybe, Tom, before that, I'll just ask you 2 quick questions to finish mine off. Just, Realine, out of the 2,500 docs that you said have visited the Realine site so far. Any idea how many of those are new docs who have never done an Invisalign case before versus maybe past Invisalign users? Just trying to -- I don't think there's going to be much cannibalization there, but obviously, that would be a good crosscheck on that. And then on the DTC said, with you ramping that back up in May pretty aggressively, and going to continue it through the summer. Is there a lagging impact on that? Do the May and June increased DTC influence 2Q yet or are those benefits probably more of a third quarter type event?","Thomas M. Prescott","Let me take this in reverse order. I'll start with the last one. There's 2 elements of any consumer demand. There's brand building and awareness over the long term. And I'll call it excitement and energy. And, again, if you think about the integrated nature of our platform, we've got both the traditional media, with a lot of digital vehicles, social, very tied-in with PR, gaming and a whole bunch of other areas. With that, you activate interest in a whole bunch of ways. So it can start a search for a doctor, it can start a background information and all that. At the end of the day, I'd call the launch, which was timed to kind of start with the beginning of the teen season, create a lot of excitement in offices and energy and all that. But the value is really 1 quarter, 2 or 3, 4 quarters ahead and then taking that to the next level. So this is just -- we view this as more strategic than tactical, and I'd say we're in the early innings there, still, of what's possible. So that's one. Remind me, sorry, your second question. I think that was...","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just, Realine, on the 2,500 doctors.","Thomas M. Prescott","On the Realine question, the 80,000 plus customer list that Schein has, by definition, none of them are certified Invisalign customers. We've actually been asked by a few doctors, hey, could I try one, Schein calls on me occasionally. We said there's no reason why you couldn't, but it won't have quite the same features that say an Express 5 would. It wouldn't have a ClinCheck they could adjust. It will have a ClinCheck type setup they will approve, but it won't give them the flexibility to customize the treatment as much. And so we have a few doctors that said they'd be interested out of curiosity. But, by definition, we expect this to be a greenfield of doctors that are -- some of them, many of them, are already buying clear aligner offerings from a local lab or a big lab. And our view is, we ought to be able to do that better than anybody else in the world and just as cost effectively for them, brought to them by a trusted partner, Henry Schein. So that's the theory of that case. With that, I'll kick you back to Roger and Karen, and see if they're ready to talk about the elements there in gross margin.","Karen Silva","Sure, Jeff, this is Karen. So a couple of things going on with the gross margin. Some of this is related to ASPs down, being down for sure. And then we also have a slightly higher cost per case of the Invisalign side, as we are expecting a number of aligners per case to be just slightly up. Now there's a few other little small pieces to it, but we also expect a little bit more depreciation as we have some fixed assets that we'll be putting into production here in this quarter.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just trying to understand the ASPs being down. If they were up a little this quarter and you get a full 3 months of the Asia Pac distributor changeover in the third quarter, ASPs naturally just swinging down in the third quarter for what reason?","Roger E. George","We have a number of factors. Certainly, one, we have a planned FX, we did a little better than that last year. There were a number of contributors before, on price. We would plan an Advantage, a participation with our big ortho customers and maybe plan on a little lower ASP, higher Advantage participation, which we view as a positive thing, of course. And then, finally, we're running a bit of a promo. I think there was something in the webcast slide. We're running a bit of a promotional, a little different one at some of these reengaged orthos that have not been big Invisalign customers, to get them to trust us to help them work on teen patients through the summer. And that'll have some impact on price, but we think that'll be a very valuable way to get them to get a really good experience in a shorter period of time. Get that trial, repeat usage and then hopefully sustainable adoption. So as we project that, if we're successful with it, we'll be very happy. That would have a little bit of a negative impact on ASP, but we would view that as a very good investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Roger, it looks like the scanner and services cost of goods fell to what looks like the lowest level since the deal closed. What drove that improvement? And any chance you could give us an update on where Cadent stands in terms of operating profitability at this point?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. The improvement figure -- well, I'll tell you what, Karen's got the quantitative data in front of her, so I'll let her hit the gross margin question.","Karen Silva","Sure. So scanner and services margin increased sequentially, primarily because we had higher production volumes and we also had lower manufacturing spend. We also had lower intangible amortization since we reduced our intangibles last quarter as well.","Roger E. George","I'll build on that a little bit. I'll take the next part of it, on where we are with -- I'll just say not just profitability. Part of making this business an even more valuable part of the family here is it's not just profitable, it's strategically valuable. We continue to be convinced the latter. It is strategically valuable. We see leverage on the Invisalign side. But if we have stand-alone profitability at issue, we're behind where we expected to be. The installed base hasn't been growing as fast as we'd like. Pricing certainly has come down with competitive offerings, and it's taken us a little longer to get platform changes. So look, say it as it is. We still think there's great strategic value to be had. We're behind where we expect to be on profitability, but still are very committed to this business.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The number, in terms of digital case submissions, certainly continues to ramp impressively. How should we be thinking about that business as we get into the third quarter and second half of the year, in terms of sequential revenue trend?","Thomas M. Prescott","In terms of the scanner business or in terms of the utilization of digital scans?","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The scanner and services revenue.","Thomas M. Prescott","Again, we had 2 or 3 factors that have made the revenue growth story tougher for us. The first is that, certainly, pricing has come down per unit versus what we though about a couple of years ago. That's a reality, we're dealing with it, and we're making solid progress. The team is working their tail off. Secondly, we've turned off some of the services stream. We're trying to drive more to digital, high-tech manufacturing monoliths, all that, and we're doing a lot of that and why that is where we have better gross margins. We're working closely with lab partners and others. But we've actually turned off what was a pretty significant part of that user base, with iQ, a bracket placement tool. We just didn't feel we could scale it. So if you really look at one of the contributors to the servicer stream coming down, that was one of the biggest factors that we -- really, roughly a year ago, we gave the notice and we've kind of pulled that down. We made the decision not to reinvest, for now, into a completely new suite of tools and software, manufacturing technology. We could go back to that with better profitability in the business over time. But, in general, the restorative business has seasonality just like the orthodontic business. People don't do a lot of restorative work unless it's an emergency over summer time, vacations, holidays, dentists' office are closed for some vacations and all that. There's a little more seasonality for general dentistry in the summer. Certainly, in Europe for sure, we don't have much of a restorative base there. And then we would expect Q4 to be busy, both on the capital equipment spending side and back to the growing services again. So there's probably a bit more pronounced seasonality in restorative dentistry than orthodontics because the teen season in ortho kind of masks that.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Roger, real quick. Any chance you could quantify the impact of the medical device tax in the second quarter?","Roger E. George","Yes, hold on, we'll pull that number up for you. $2.1 million is the answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you can maybe just explain a little or give us your views. When you look at Schein agreement longer term, does that help you better penetrate the existing 10% to 15% of the market that are using independent labs or does that really scale the reach for the company over time? And then I have just one quick follow-up.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. I think it does both of those, and then the other -- because there is some usage going on, we've seen it, we've surveyed to it, and from a variety of small, medium and large labs, they're getting clear aligner offerings, which we can do better than and give them that great value proposition, delivering it through a great partner like Schein. The second thing is there are more and more people having conversations with their family dentist, not ready to go see an orthodontic specialist yet, which we could encourage, or to go see another dentist that's doing Invisalign. Many times, dentists don't want to refer them to another dentist that is doing Invisalign, and they're simply not sure yet, if they want to go commit to the effort and practice to integrate a procedure like Invisalign. So this does give them an opportunity to at least to try very simple cases from a company they can trust and a partner they really respect in Schein. So ultimately, it gets at the widest part of the dental industry that we're not touching today, and we really don't have a meaningful way to get at. And then, secondly, I think it can help support longer term category growth for clear aligner therapy.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then just as a quick follow-on. You have an enviable decision of having a very nice cash position on the balance sheet. And now that you've wrapped up the prior repurchase that was authorized, just thoughts on how should we think about the cash build there on the balance sheet, future uses.","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. A fair question. I would say this is a continuing topic, an important topic for the Align Board of Directors. And we continue to get input from our owners about their views on capital allocation, how we should think about ensuring value for the shareholders, and we will continue to share those views with our board. But I'd say we've been busy as of last quarter. Let us go back and pile up a little bit more and we're going to continue to run the business as good stewards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with Janney Capital.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions here. Number one, in terms of your revenue guidance for the third quarter. The last year, there was a little bit of a surprise with the patient volume suddenly dropping off for whatever reason, possibly due to the dentists taking more time off during summer months. How has that -- those possibilities were included in your guidance -- with the current guidance that you provided today?","Thomas M. Prescott","Sure. I guess maybe asking the question differently to myself. Do we learn anything from last year? In retrospect, and we've known this for some time though, one of the most important trends -- it has some predictive value, is patient traffic in offices in North America. And as we reconstruct Q3 and Q4 of 2012, it is very clear that a significant deceleration in patient visits started, actually, in Q2, and we didn't see it because of just how strong Q4 of 2011, Q1 and Q2 of 2012 were. Other dental players started seeing it in Q2. It surprised us in Q3, and our methods of understanding volume and activity in offices didn't yield that. It was not until, literally, the big players like Schein and Patterson were reporting widespread downturn in patient traffic and procedures, that we were able to go back and look at this. So what have we learned? We've learned to continue to be humble, and we've instituted a series of new surveys and pulses of offices, not just asking customers what their expectations are, but actually trying to determine what their patient traffic procedures volumes are month over month, and understand if there's any foreshadowing for future. So we have the same visibility we've always had in our business. We take this very seriously. This is a challenging business to forecast given the fragmentation. But all of that, to your original question, is loaded into our view of what hopefully looks like, whatever normal might be, a more normal seasonal Q3.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Asia. Clearly, you guys saw a lot of strength there, including ASP. That actually went up dramatically in my view. I'm curious, how much do we expect in terms of maintaining that sort of strength out there, in terms of -- China sort of hasn't opened up fully. How do you see Asian market unfolding over the next several quarters?","Thomas M. Prescott","I think, as Karen told you, if you take ASP to start with, as Karen spoke about a moment ago, the big jump, one of the big contributors to company ASP performance was the 50% step-up -- or the 100% step-up, the doubling of effective price for the biggest part of our geography in Asia Pacific through the distributors. May 1, that converted to a more normal global price for our Invisalign ASP versus giving to the distributor -- or selling to distributor at 50%. That will continue, that's persistent. As Karen also talked about, there's an offsetting OpEx step-up with 47 new employees that came in. But we know day one contribution margins are actually net positive on that very first case that came in on May 1, even with a step-up. So the second part of the question I believe you asked is, how confident are we about the longer term growth? We really are just getting started in many of these geographies. Our penetration is an order of magnitude or more or less than in North America or Europe. And in places like China, we're seeing the path towards growth in Japan. We're seeing the path towards growth. And understanding that these cases, most of the cases in Asia, are dramatically more complex than in North America. The evolutions in product technology and easier to do these complex cases makes a very big deal for them. So on balance, this is strategically very important. We believe we continue to grow there and we're in the process of making investments to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jeffrey Bailin","This is actually Jeff Bailin in for Glen. So you had some pretty impressive growth in your international case volume this quarter, up over 20%, and particularly impressive in Europe, given some of the macro challenges we've been hearing about there. Can you talk about what you think is supporting your growth there and maybe how you'd characterize the growth rates in case volumes in Europe relative to how you are growing in Asia Pacific?","Thomas M. Prescott","And I just wanted to clarify, Jeff, you want me to unpack Europe specifically a bit more?","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that would great, and just what you think is supporting the growth there.","Thomas M. Prescott","Perfect. Okay, got it. Well, I think if you may remember, as we talked about early in the year, we didn't give annual guidance but we did signal that our operating margin would have a little more drag early in the year, based on investments in new consumer demand, which we've now rolled out, based on product evolutions which we're in the middle of, and based on coverage expansion, and that happened both in North America and Europe. But if I take Europe specifically, we've changed some country leadership, where we felt it was time for that. That takes a little while to work out, and one of the things, when you struggle a bit in a challenging economy, it helps you find where you can be better. So that's the virtuous part of that challenge. We've invested in some of the geographies we weren't -- our coverage wasn't completed. We've added a number of sales reps in Germany. We've added some management structure in some of these countries where they were getting big enough. We've added coverage in the U.K., in France, incrementally in Spain. And so we've incrementally added resources alongside of this product evolution which has been better and better received by these doctors, mostly orthodontists in general, that treat, in general, harder cases and have very high standards. So as the product has gotten better, we've been more comfortable to make incremental coverage investments. And while there was a bit of a cost lead first and a volume lag second, I think that, plus all of the other initiatives we've got going, start to give us the kind of volumes we can be comfortable with. And we have reasonable confidence that, while we won't be linear, I think we're pretty confident that we can continue to grow faster in Europe and North America, and faster in Asia than Europe and North America.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just one quick follow-up, shifting to the scanner business if they can. In the past, you've discussed potentially being open to partnerships with other scanner vendors, particularly for digital case submission. Is that something you still think could make sense and that the company is open to?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes. We signaled that during our Q1 call, because we were going to be right in the middle of customer central, with the AAO and some other big trade shows. We still believe that it's strategically valuable. We also are realistic that we're not going to sell every scanner out there. We believe we've got the best scanner, still, in the market. And if we can qualify a couple of the leading scanners out there and bring that value to their customers, our respective customers, there's potential benefit all around.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis with Roth Capital Partners.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","First, on the Express segment, that came in quite ahead of our volume expectations for the quarter. So I was hoping maybe you could maybe provide some more commentary on that segment and where that growth came from during the quarter. And then longer term, with the growth of some of the lower-priced segments, how does that impact your margins and your ASPs over time?","Thomas M. Prescott","Yes. I think the short answer for the volume growth in Express 5 is North American GP. We're still getting started in Europe with i7 and i14, but good solid traction for that very cost sensitive patient that has been presented with a comprehensive treatment and says, I'm not ready to spend $5,000 or $6,000 or $4,000 to $5,000, I really want this little space or that little crowding fixed, and this gives the doctor in the practice an opportunity to at least get after that chief complaint. The second part of your question -- so it's North America GP to start with. The second part of the question is around gross margin, I think, and at the end of the day, I think the longer discussion is contribution margin. The gross margin, in the very short term, is a little bit worse but very comparable to say, over the mid to longer term gross margin. As we continue to automate processes we'll probably be as good as or better on the simpler cases than they are on the harder cases. Fewer ClinCheck cycles, refinements, things like that. So very, very comfortable. On the contribution margin, when we net out kind of the direct cost of sales marketing, it might actually be better than that. But, again, it's early days. Our goal is to continue to build at both ends, aim for becoming standard of care someday, which is our long-term goal, which really means we have to earn our way into the specialist office and those GPs do a lot of orthodontic cases as their tool of choice. At the same time, widen the base with things like Realine, Express 5, 10, i7 and 14, hit a niche that isn't really being addressed. People, frankly, that don't want brackets.","Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then turning to the international side. I was wondering if you could quantify the incremental revenue impact the direct conversion in Asia Pac had on the quarter.","Thomas M. Prescott","We're not providing that level of breakout, but I think you can maybe back into it a little, based on historical numbers we've given. But I think, when you see the ASP impact, you know it's meaningful. And the growth rates there to support greater meaning in the future.","Shirley Stacy","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, and if you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations.
